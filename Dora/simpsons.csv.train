49088,Lisa,"no dad, i want you to play homer simpson."
47571,Lisa,how 'bout the floor is made of lava?
42003,Lisa,"c'mon, dad. it doesn't take a genius to realize that houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
44909,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom and dad!"
44704,Lisa,dear log: can it be true? do all simpsons go through a process of dumbening?
47143,Lisa,did clara... tell you anything else?
46027,Lisa,"aw, jesse. they locked you up again."
49149,Lisa,"okay, i'll do the monologue."
43833,Lisa,what are you talking about?
49026,Lisa,and i'm happy to be smoke-free -- thanks to these children's nicotine patches.
41598,Lisa,"it's so great that yale has finally forbidden men from taking science. now let's see, should i major in femistry or galgebra?"
42752,Lisa,yeah. maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
44720,Lisa,easy does it now... easy... little more... yea... right... that's the spot... ooah!
45776,Lisa,"my fellow americans, and voting illegal aliens: i will not mince words. your country needs you. that's why today i am proposing a temporary refund adjustment."
50437,Lisa,banned books?!
48716,Lisa,"feel better now, bart?"
47317,Lisa,what is that?!
41848,Lisa,looking at you with quiet awe.
49788,Lisa,"no, this can't be right."
48227,Lisa,my saxophone!
51877,Lisa,"go, dad!"
50683,Lisa,"if we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset."
51000,Lisa,"mary, could i steal bart for a minute?"
47002,Lisa,very well. l-i-t-t-l-e -m-i-s-s...
47577,Lisa,let me finish my sentence!
49679,Lisa,i'm thinking of joining.
52217,Lisa,"i couldn't tell you how many hours. it was a labor of love. it's my homage to some american heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless..."
51476,Lisa,this one whistled at me!
46394,Lisa,"you keep digging like this, you're gonna go straight through to china."
50799,Lisa,solitude?
46182,Lisa,"oh, it's tough being the new kid. someone should go talk to her."
43565,Lisa,"just shut up and listen. there's something fishy about grandma. whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. and just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
48185,Lisa,"hey, she says the mayor speaks english."
50722,Lisa,we never do my thing!
52529,Lisa,are you sure?
45020,Lisa,"uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?"
50735,Lisa,"hear, hear!"
49496,Lisa,"hm. there was a note on the fridge marked ""urgent."" funny word: ""urgent."" ""urrrgent."" urgent."
48869,Lisa,yes.
41664,Lisa,"okay, i'll do it. but whom should i beat up?"
46333,Lisa,i can't remember the last time dad sang us a torch song.
49614,Lisa,there must be a better way.
42298,Lisa,"be-bop? ""be-bop""?"
41672,Lisa,here it comes.
42601,Lisa,you're the head vampire?
44393,Lisa,we're here!
51383,Lisa,"even better! they're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
49453,Lisa,the jewel will lead me to my baby sister? why are you telling me this?
50637,Lisa,it's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center?
49525,Lisa,it just gets worse and worse.
45777,Lisa,the months ahead will be long and arduous. but it is only through arduousity th...
49792,Lisa,"well, are you gonna help me or what?"
48047,Lisa,"dad, how much money did you bet?"
48069,Lisa,i thought those people were your friends.
48365,Lisa,"that's easy -- just one, the number five."
44202,Lisa,"lots more coffee. are you getting ready for bed, bart?"
51035,Lisa,property of abraham j. simpson? this is grampa's stuff!
48465,Lisa,i did? how?
47178,Lisa,"dad, maybe you could lead bart's tribe."
51908,Lisa,arrrgh!
50812,Lisa,to thank you!
41979,Lisa,wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
45179,Lisa,"hey, there is one thing we could do."
51136,Lisa,"you know, in the middle ages people took refuge in church to escape the bubonic plague, but that made the plague spread even faster!"
52290,Lisa,why are we using the good china?
51619,Lisa,"three feet, nine inches. that should do it."
51755,Lisa,knot with a k.
42541,Lisa,why haven't you hung up your gold record?
45067,Lisa,"dad, you really should be watching the road."
45370,Lisa,"yeah, me too."
47073,Lisa,"thanks a lot, surviving beach boys."
43403,Lisa,"well, he did vow revenge. but i can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! he's a celebrit--"
51368,Lisa,"what i'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your tv show with actors from other countries..."
46136,Lisa,what's so funny? i'm better than you.
50772,Lisa,they have itchy and scratchy weddings?
42334,Lisa,yayyy!
52138,Lisa,stop!
46576,Lisa,"so bart, when does the killing start?"
49776,Lisa,"um... can i have it on account? on account of i want it? you've heard that one, huh?"
44521,Lisa,it's a bone scraping from that skeleton i found.
43638,Lisa,"wow, two finds in one store! what are the odds?"
42812,Lisa,tough kids...
47294,Lisa,maybe you could give us a personal tour of your country.
47277,Lisa,"chief wiggum, we're just like you policemen. don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
45262,Lisa,"until you taped over it, ""the little mermaid."""
42518,Lisa,"i don't think they're giving you enough information, dad."
50154,Lisa,what could've happened?
45680,Lisa,"that's nice, but maybe your homecoming float should have something to do with college."
42299,Lisa,"well, don't push her. remember, ""tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
48499,Lisa,dad! a flying saucer blew up that statue!
43048,Lisa,ma. i think i'm all hugged out. oh... one more.
45759,Lisa,"sorry i'm late. i've been racking my brain, trying to think of something to cut from the budget."
45013,Lisa,"somebody had to tell him, mom. in the long run, it's much kinder to--"
51728,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
48418,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
46463,Lisa,lenny and carl?
51312,Lisa,that isn't a word.
46984,Lisa,...u-g-n. impugn.
47853,Lisa,"bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived."
45813,Lisa,"boy, you can see everything from mount springfield. the squidport, the old monorail..."
46001,Lisa,"it's okay, mom! i have a safety line!"
46141,Lisa,"the answer is ""bonbon""!"
44417,Lisa,nuh-uh.
51793,Lisa,"i still believe in this town... a town that deserves its own original song! and as an aspiring musician with off-broadway dreams, i'm the one to write it!"
42867,Lisa,"well, i'm sure i could have, but i'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends."
42798,Lisa,you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
50381,Lisa,you're just gonna stand there?
52119,Lisa,"oh, brother."
50711,Lisa,wait! maybe paula paul left a message.
49588,Lisa,"people, i'm not who you think i am. i'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends. yes, i lied to you, but you only liked me because of a lie. so if you think about it--"
43545,Lisa,eww! mo-om!
49051,Lisa,okay. meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
50652,Lisa,"i have a thousand friends, and i feel more alone than ever!"
42300,Lisa,"tell it, mom. tell, it mom."
42851,Lisa,"shut up, brain! i got friends now. i don't need you anymore. duh, yeah, i'd love to go to your house."
47681,Lisa,"if you win, ovenfresh industries will make you the new face of auntie ovenfresh."
48164,Lisa,"oh sure, i get it. bart told you i was taking lessons, so you thought you'd come over and--"
52472,Lisa,sometimes i wish strangling your kid was still legal.
41890,Lisa,bart... bart...
48790,Lisa,here we go. four-three-two...
44141,Lisa,yes. terrible.
41605,Lisa,"so nelson, who did you end up bringing tonight? sherri or terri?"
48089,Lisa,but i'm too smart to get scared.
51049,Lisa,"lisa simpson, hi. as second grade student-faculty liaison, i'd like to welcome you-"
43179,Lisa,"hey dad, whatcha doing?"
45804,Lisa,hmmm.
48585,Lisa,wait! haven't you learned a lesson here? over-fishing and greed have brought this town nothing but rack and ruin.
47573,Lisa,i guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.
50223,Lisa,"i'm a member of people for the ethical treatment of amoebas, the league of women vultures, the n-double-a-c-porcupines, kids for squids, the a.c.l. unicorns, clamnesty international and, uh... well, those are the best ones."
47406,Lisa,leaving!
50092,Lisa,thanks. you can be the free safety.
49157,Lisa,melvin van horne... sideshow mel?! it's you! how could this happen to you... to all these wonderful performers?
50965,Lisa,"whatcha reading, dad?"
42738,Lisa,wait! don't be fooled! she's just a regular malibu stacy with a stupid cheap hat! she still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before.
41633,Lisa,hey...
41668,Lisa,"you can do it, lisa. there's nothing in the room but you and the test."
46884,Lisa,it still beats disney's california adventure.
49442,Lisa,dad! come in the kitchen! quick!
50790,Lisa,"what is the point? i think this is the end of me. all i had was my integrity. and now that's gone. i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. i try not to cry till you're asleep."
50317,Lisa,"let me finish: thanks to your wonderful, wonderful drug."
45766,Lisa,"i am proud to honor the players of the negro leagues of rollerball. and as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by..."
51869,Lisa,we've been robbed!
46708,Lisa,"you're reading ""gravity's rainbow?"""
47759,Lisa,"mom, that was incredible!"
47547,Lisa,i think skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
45112,Lisa,"we've got a test, and i didn't read the book. i'll get a zero for sure, bart! what do i do?"
51912,Lisa,it's mrs. hoover's birthday!
44849,Lisa,"ah, the old number 22. clean, reliable public transportation. the chariot of the people. the ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. sure, some folks prefer--"
48618,Lisa,"well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked."
42006,Lisa,the broken neck blues.
45798,Lisa,really? anything good?
42153,Lisa,maggie! maggie!
42811,Lisa,skinny kids...
44188,Lisa,"thank you, dr. hibbert. your trust means so much to me."
52320,Lisa,"dad, we may have saved your soul."
45840,Lisa,"dad, i've got maggie."
49146,Lisa,long john seltzer!
48530,Lisa,"dad, no! i'm not mad at moe anymore!"
47862,Lisa,"yes, but he thought that was a bad thing."
49475,Lisa,from this angle they're words!
48893,Lisa,he would never get a shakespeare quote wrong --
47011,Lisa,free college?
52298,Lisa,why you cagey ol' dog.
43186,Lisa,and... action!
44292,Lisa,"thanks, dad!"
45412,Lisa,done!
52021,Lisa,"don't be scared, dad. it's not so hard taking care of us."
51945,Lisa,"every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. and we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable..."
48432,Lisa,"well, you're not gonna find any here."
51038,Lisa,"""gorilla joe,"" ""gorilla sam,"" ""gorilla pete,"" ""ook and eek, the gorilla twins""... where did mr. burns dig up all these old wrestlers?"
50143,Lisa,"eight forever? whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! i can't spend eternity using kid scissors. they barely cut anything!"
44858,Lisa,crackton? that doesn't sound right.
47285,Lisa,okay.
52313,Lisa,"maybe. i don't watch him every minute. but what i am sure of is, we're getting cable for free."
46945,Lisa,"stop it, please! i'm trying to eat."
47807,Lisa,i'm not inferring anything. you infer. i imply.
48757,Lisa,so why steal the yogurt? we have to find out what they're up to.
45746,Lisa,"thank you. ""a gay president in 2084""?"
46503,Lisa,"thanks a lot, everybody. now i'll never get into an ivy league school."
49504,Lisa,"ooh, it must be bloomsday!"
52085,Lisa,"hey, mom."
45540,Lisa,something's growing.
45069,Lisa,"step on it, mom. dad's signaling that he wants to go higher."
47869,Lisa,i'm not sharpening it!
51454,Lisa,bob! you saved me! but how did you get the strength? calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
50877,Lisa,i know why they're here!
45945,Lisa,"well, according to whatbadgerseat.com, ""badgers subsist primarily on a diet of stoats, voles and marmots."""
50417,Lisa,why would a popular fifth-grader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse?
49397,Lisa,please stop doing that.
44287,Lisa,"but according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
42997,Lisa,"bart! we did it! now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
42537,Lisa,i can't believe you're not still popular.
44170,Lisa,"um, do you know what you're doing?"
46229,Lisa,"i have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. i call it ""poindextrose""."
52403,Lisa,and what was ringo's response?
44820,Lisa,"dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?"
46822,Lisa,"well, bart's being his usual jerky self... but mom, i'm really excited about this new flag design. oh, and the hotel gives you a free usa today outside your room... no, i'm sure it's free... okay, i won't touch it."
43953,Lisa,wildflowers! we don't have you in springfield!
49979,Lisa,what's that delicious smell?
44169,Lisa,no!
42771,Lisa,mom! dad! bart and stampy are gone!
47965,Lisa,"and remember, save the violence for cartoons!"
51579,Lisa,"yeah, it kind of was. but i won't push it, i promise. see ya!"
48696,Lisa,"dad, i'm impressed! you've become a much better referee."
42897,Lisa,you're finished already? but the competition isn't for weeks.
49209,Lisa,"my god, bart, what happened to us?"
51375,Lisa,no thanks.
50416,Lisa,"oh. usually, milhouse does it."
46253,Lisa,"hey, mom."
48905,Lisa,"look, we all care about quintile disparity, but the democrats can't win with another prissy brainiac."
41828,Lisa,"i'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
51812,Lisa,"take it, bart!"
48127,Lisa,i'm afraid the best thing i could find is this.
50215,Lisa,"yes, i believe i have your pigeon, ""raymond bird,"" and i need to know how to return him to you."
46235,Lisa,the repellent's all gone!
45984,Lisa,you do yoga?
48315,Lisa,"but you just got a new lease on life. why would you want to use it to hurt poor, helpless animals?"
50511,Lisa,"this game has all the best college marching bands! from the precision footwork of ohio state to the lame, dead-on-arrival humor of stanford!"
47707,Lisa,this store makes me feel even worse about myself.
46643,Lisa,that's right.
45866,Lisa,i've gotta go now.
41923,Lisa,"she likes a little carrot after her oats. and she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. and if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. please take good care of my princess."
46114,Lisa,it's so passionate. it almost leaps off the wall.
47489,Lisa,lousy maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows...
42218,Lisa,i'll do it.
49926,Lisa,"goodbye, bluella! send me a post card from tierra del fuego!"
51303,Lisa,"it's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!"
49704,Lisa,more... more...
43419,Lisa,"yeah, that's how fast grampa is shrinking."
42121,Lisa,sideshow bob!
46345,Lisa,"paul bunyan never fought rodan. and his size seems to be really inconsistent. i mean, one minute he's ten feet tall, the next his feet are as big as a lake..."
49070,Lisa,"well, i guess i could cut loose and do a little homework."
42727,Lisa,"but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. i'm sure we can think of something together. c'mon!"
52354,Lisa,get my homework from mrs. hoover.
43878,Lisa,a compliment!
47744,Lisa,that was such an exciting night. morley safer has the biggest head i've ever seen.
45634,Lisa,here are your lunches. and no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
51354,Lisa,but i--
50944,Lisa,amen.
45734,Lisa,trophies! trophies! attendance!
50558,Lisa,"spot, stop, sop, top-tops, pot-pots, opt-opts, post!"
42610,Lisa,"i always knew some day mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
46851,Lisa,"yes, but now that it's hip, all the ex-presidents are doing it."
43751,Lisa,"well, how about aunt patty and aunt selma at the d.m.v.?"
51775,Lisa,no! let's take the eagle to shelbyville animal rescue. where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
51731,Lisa,are we there yet?
45600,Lisa,nobody! you're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy.
49782,Lisa,"i'm fine! fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
51551,Lisa,"um, can i just have a slice?"
50641,Lisa,"as the ceo of springface, i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
51464,Lisa,"to quote whitman: ""this is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and animals, despise riches, stand up for the stupid and crazy..."""
49292,Lisa,can't you open your mapple menu and click on the compassion bar? oh please?
45617,Lisa,see mom? you conquered your fears and now you're ready to sk--
48215,Lisa,"well, this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple dna test."
46458,Lisa,"i still believe in god. i just think there's another path to him, or her."
46407,Lisa,"i did. you owe rem an apology for, eco-fraud."
52453,Lisa,does bart have to be there?
44093,Lisa,mr. smithers! mr. smithers! i found another hurt shrew! i think this one has a twisted ankle!
50089,Lisa,"really?... they sound like... i mean... well, the thing..."
48504,Lisa,"colonel, i hope you've learned that an occupying foreign force can never defeat a determined local populace. among the many things we learned in vietnam is that a well-motivated..."
48941,Lisa,"hey martin, what are you doing?"
46870,Lisa,but the game's not even over!
47623,Lisa,"my card here says ""aclu"" / now look what i'm going to do..."
49362,Lisa,a two-nicorn!
41861,Lisa,a man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
50529,Lisa,"we should start our own food blog... ""the three mouthketeers!"""
49391,Lisa,vance connor...
46189,Lisa,"uh, francine? i think we got off to a bad start so... hey!"
49432,Lisa,"you want a cookie, dad?"
46628,Lisa,"oh great, now hamlet's acting crazy. well, nobody out-crazies ophelia! hey, nonny, nonny, with a hoo and a haw and a nonny, nonny, hey..."
44299,Lisa,you again.
52047,Lisa,i'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
46307,Lisa,can you take me to school? please?
49071,Lisa,i can start working on my school video project. the assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. so let's see...
45555,Lisa,"mom, no! everyone at school picks on the ""pöpli"" kids. even i do. i just hate them so much."
52255,Lisa,"but, mom! if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots."
51686,Lisa,"wait, stop! why must you kill my dad? especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?"
49966,Lisa,"dressing in uniforms is a good thing -- if everyone looks the same, it levels the playing field."
49886,Lisa,"well, i'm so glad i'm not your mom."
46721,Lisa,robert pinsky?! the former poet laureate?
52420,Lisa,"yes, but i didn't do it."
44955,Lisa,absolutely.
46939,Lisa,"mom, you didn't get the milk."
43676,Lisa,he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
44825,Lisa,"'cause he's homer simpson, man"
45661,Lisa,... horrible wailing...
47401,Lisa,"fine, i'll tell you how it ends. the brutish captain mordecai has cornered his rival, cyrus..."
47412,Lisa,"oh bart, i'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend."
42628,Lisa,"the few, the proud, the geeky."
42876,Lisa,it hurts my teeth.
43253,Lisa,but you've been going on about these all week. i'm sure he just forgot.
43005,Lisa,okilly dokilly.
43948,Lisa,yeah. did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking each other down? i've never been to a place like that before.
46483,Lisa,my family tried to trick me into celebrating christmas!
52363,Lisa,keep on truckin'? what does that mean?
47972,Lisa,and skinner / and grampa / and ol' disco stu...
45159,Lisa,no he doesn't. trains are regulated by the federal department of transportation. and recent studies have shown that...
51431,Lisa,miss hoover?
44817,Lisa,"come on, mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money."
51748,Lisa,right hand red!
49419,Lisa,they're all equally valid! but that can't be. in life everything only has one answer!
50049,Lisa,"i will. i'll take a chance on you, nelson muntz."
47150,Lisa,oh! someone is spying on us!
49387,Lisa,"""...unfortunately, it is not what we're looking for at this time. thank you for thinking of us."""
50222,Lisa,"mom, why am i so repulsed by pigeons? it doesn't make any sense."
41992,Lisa,"goodnight, dad. i had a really nice time today."
48547,Lisa,"angelica button and the dragon king's trundle bed. it's the ninth book in the ""angelica button"" series."
48906,Lisa,"mom, they're taking ralph's candidacy seriously! this is a disaster."
48373,Lisa,eep.
41602,Lisa,"um, have you eaten onions lately?"
47329,Lisa,aww.
43117,Lisa,you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
45394,Lisa,"oh, absolutely! well, you know, anything by jane austen..."
49955,Lisa,i... i...
42918,Lisa,"yes, i do. and just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
46852,Lisa,"there's clinton, bush senior, and the nice guy who finished last, jimmy himself."
42636,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you."
47678,Lisa,"oh, my god! this is the worst halloween horror we've ever faced."
51304,Lisa,i'd better go.
43647,Lisa,i'm going to contribute my money to the corporation for public broadcasting.
48175,Lisa,milhouse! just what is going on?
41673,Lisa,but then... you wound up like you.
50646,Lisa,i have a thousand friends! and only eight of them are milhouse.
42018,Lisa,"you're going back into the shoe-box. it may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest."
46291,Lisa,what's happening? where am i?
47737,Lisa,"chloe, you've lived so many fascinating places."
41944,Lisa,one of the economic powers of the world--
51330,Lisa,pour me another.
43861,Lisa,"a microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was i thinking?"
48921,Lisa,"we're in the middle of our own story, thank you."
46334,Lisa,what about us?
45646,Lisa,good. maple soda?... a cell phone full of candy?... astronaut bread?
50074,Lisa,sorry.
43530,Lisa,"sorry, dad. this is our spot."
42780,Lisa,i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. in this phallocentric society of ours...
47600,Lisa,"mom, why are you so mad?"
46970,Lisa,"no dad, it means bart would be a legal adult and free to move out of the house."
45811,Lisa,"okay, on three. one... two..."
52173,Lisa,there he is!
42490,Lisa,whacking day is coming.
41972,Lisa,what's going on?
48525,Lisa,but... i deserve... acknowledgement...
51770,Lisa,"listen, homer. i just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me."
43268,Lisa,"what's wrong, boy? getting tired?"
51230,Lisa,...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!
51906,Lisa,so did mine.
41844,Lisa,"bart, you're not laughing. too subtle?"
43537,Lisa,i must protest. you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
46375,Lisa,creative sentencing is common these days. that's why bill clinton is our new mailman.
51871,Lisa,yeah!
42946,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's dead!
46147,Lisa,"mommm, can't bart get his massage somewhere else?"
42148,Lisa,"why didn't you write, unky herb?"
44020,Lisa,you play the guitar?
46910,Lisa,huh?
49075,Lisa,"three it is! you're the teacher, and i accept your decision."
49205,Lisa,just ask those guys for directions.
45214,Lisa,we should really put that in the corner.
42473,Lisa,"look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
49726,Lisa,"larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like? fusion? neo-bop?"
43552,Lisa,shouldn't you be working?
48123,Lisa,mid-june?
50614,Lisa,"um, none."
46144,Lisa,"you got all your equipment, dad?"
48746,Lisa,"what if santa's little helper stops being a police dog? then he can get a non-violent job, like barking songs on novelty christmas records. you can do it, boy!"
47381,Lisa,"wait, you don't want me to have this cat!"
44261,Lisa,"yeah, krabappel. they were naked in the closet together."
46060,Lisa,at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that.
45532,Lisa,"could you build us a house, president carter? we can't go back to ours."
47561,Lisa,at the dayton arms hotel?
51493,Lisa,i hear chewing!
45007,Lisa,"you've started smoking, dad?"
43240,Lisa,"all right, dad! i'm sorry i left you alone with homer and bart."
44922,Lisa,hey!
51509,Lisa,"madame curie, we just might have this one in the bag."
51991,Lisa,yes!!!
42131,Lisa,how?
48742,Lisa,a sports bra?
41809,Lisa,"mr. lincoln, my name is lisa simpson, and i have a problem."
42681,Lisa,"and now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase."
46165,Lisa,meh.
52105,Lisa,"he doesn't care, mom."
51615,Lisa,"so bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
51051,Lisa,meat?!
51307,Lisa,f.d.r.'s steadfast leadership also helped america win world war two...
50225,Lisa,i'll tell you later.
45805,Lisa,and it's still got a roll of film in it.
48819,Lisa,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
43733,Lisa,and soon.
45308,Lisa,"oh, milhouse is selling seeds! and he's coming this wa... oh, the birds got him."
47877,Lisa,the great wall of china was begun nearly two thousand years ago in order to repel barbarian invaders.
48050,Lisa,all we've got is ketchup.
42661,Lisa,thank you.
41720,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
42739,Lisa,"well, i guess you can't beat big business. there's just no room for the little guy."
50306,Lisa,"dad, is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee?"
45272,Lisa,"dad, why did you have to take away my room?"
48283,Lisa,that was awesome!
46004,Lisa,"oh, seven o'clock. the family's just sitting down to dinner."
49722,Lisa,"if you're not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me."
50335,Lisa,that was kind of the same as the first time.
49511,Lisa,sideshow bob!
50420,Lisa,shut up! i just want to know what she's up to with milhouse. a girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even kyle lobianco!
52516,Lisa,should i have married nelson? 'cause we still talk on the phone.
44778,Lisa,"and now, sports."
42843,Lisa,"uh, bart...?"
48428,Lisa,i'm not afraid of you.
50036,Lisa,"what i don't get is, why all the lies?"
41856,Lisa,"dad, there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall, dinah shore, william shatner, and mel brooks."
51122,Lisa,"hush, sweet boy. let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows."
42647,Lisa,i just had a bad dream.
42076,Lisa,but i'll practice every day!
46325,Lisa,it looks like an amusement park.
47578,Lisa,"well, it looks like everything worked out just fine for everybody."
49308,Lisa,"dad, don't eat the bees!"
44481,Lisa,i got it.
50367,Lisa,"willie, if you will?"
45291,Lisa,"wow, i've been a cat, a tree, and cokie roberts! it's happening again! i wonder where i'm going this time."
47173,Lisa,"good for you, dad. could you get me some syrup?"
52371,Lisa,and look!
48342,Lisa,i can't wait to see this re-imagining of itchy and scratchy... by avant-garde director juliana krellner!
46592,Lisa,"see you later, i'm going to the library."
51046,Lisa,she's brought her own orrery!
47761,Lisa,"praying to buddha, jesus, sponge bob. there's no time to be picky."
49570,Lisa,"bart, at this school, i'm not a brain, i'm not popular, i'm not anything!"
51061,Lisa,what if i home school?
43710,Lisa,stop it! where's the silver tongue?!
46036,Lisa,"oh, dad."
49472,Lisa,"oh my god. i know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""springfield"" is. it's been right in front of us the whole time."
47390,Lisa,why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
45196,Lisa,"wow, you've signed up quite a few people, dad: sea captain, bumblebee man, comic book guy, the squeaky voiced teen..."
47745,Lisa,it's gonna be a let-down going to school tomorrow. we have to make a pilgrim out of felt.
46613,Lisa,wait! i have been sent to lead the french army to victory.
45199,Lisa,"oh, those poor, helpless cows."
51120,Lisa,"milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but i was gonna go for a nature walk after school and i thought maybe you'd like to..."
41927,Lisa,hmmm hmmm. there's a big dumb animal i love even more than that horse.
46443,Lisa,what are they doing to the church?
46430,Lisa,murder most foul?
50499,Lisa,now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room!
50983,Lisa,very good.
49626,Lisa,thanks... but i'll pass.
43272,Lisa,"look, it's twins!"
43006,Lisa,okay.
50259,Lisa,did you get a good house-sitter?
42307,Lisa,davah hassahoff.
46863,Lisa,"mom, do something!"
45181,Lisa,"/ ohh, yeahhhh."
48509,Lisa,you have a worldview both bleak and beautiful! i wanna write a report about you!
45702,Lisa,glow sticks? but visual aids are against the rules!
49234,Lisa,isn't it beautiful?
51502,Lisa,yes we do. it's a johan oldenveldt.
50609,Lisa,it's too early to call shotgun!
42152,Lisa,"well, i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization. look at this ad from ""new republic for kids."" each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""paradise regained,"" ""martin chuzzlewit,"" or herman melville's twin classics ""omoo"" and ""typee""."
49909,Lisa,oh my god...
49762,Lisa,"well, i agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world, but..."
46900,Lisa,i love happy endings.
45628,Lisa,"dad, where are your clothes?"
42850,Lisa,"thanks, nelson."
46713,Lisa,"um... of course. where do you think i go, baby school?"
47435,Lisa,"well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
52500,Lisa,i have to decide whether to make milhouse human again. i even prefer the way he smells now. some meat went bad in our freezer and my heart skipped a beat.
45630,Lisa,"okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat."
43058,Lisa,you want a piece of me?
50851,Lisa,"oh no, i've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it!"
48763,Lisa,"we have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts. martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid."
51310,Lisa,first president bush?
43895,Lisa,i just know we're gonna be friends forever.
50793,Lisa,"dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help."
41803,Lisa,an early crusader for women's rights. she led the floormop rebellion of 1910. later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece.
49839,Lisa,"grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?"
51132,Lisa,our poor couch...
48728,Lisa,larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt?
52358,Lisa,wow. neat. it smells historic.
51860,Lisa,"i don't care what that stupid test says, bart. you're a dimwit."
43173,Lisa,"thank you, bart. i promise i won't make fun of you later for this."
48116,Lisa,"mom, mr. burns is gonna kill dad!"
46946,Lisa,and all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
43243,Lisa,"mom, i feel kinda funny wearing white - i mean, milhouse."
51862,Lisa,"hey, lookin' good, bart."
48124,Lisa,"dad, there's no such thing as ""father's day eve."""
51495,Lisa,pokey!
47764,Lisa,... hell-o operator...
50039,Lisa,"goodbye, guys. i'll try again when i'm older..."
49885,Lisa,bart! that pop tart wasn't locally farmed or sourced!
50024,Lisa,arts camp was lovely.
50700,Lisa,"ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! y'know, i'm glad we're in exile."
48354,Lisa,"assistant groundskeeper skinner, don't you think it's wrong that i can't get the best math education because i'm a girl?"
47307,Lisa,"yes, bart. an elephant's butt."
41913,Lisa,"father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
52227,Lisa,"""howl of the unappreciated"", by lisa simpson. ""i saw the best meal""..."
44014,Lisa,snowball! i - don't - understand. she loves to climb in h--
50615,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't do this. it's not fair how much influence you have!"
50766,Lisa,"first of all, congratulations on getting the lead."
45780,Lisa,why you little...
49828,Lisa,"the year was 1860, and the underground railroad was..."
45825,Lisa,mom! bart's sitting next to me!
42142,Lisa,we leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
52038,Lisa,i wonder when dad's coming home?
47772,Lisa,no!
45284,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to go to a new age store just for me. i know you think this stuff is stupid."
42952,Lisa,cool! / neat-o!
51702,Lisa,hello? hello? is everything okay?
47956,Lisa,"stop it! you'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. now, close your eyes..."
49991,Lisa,"now, let's scoot together."
50902,Lisa,what? he didn't fold? but that's insane unless he has...
51229,Lisa,"say, mr. hat, i don't mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain."
43959,Lisa,"oh, little chipmunk friend. i'm allergic to everything!"
49092,Lisa,"okay, one more take."
45385,Lisa,you won second place?
47647,Lisa,"""dear readers: you hold in your hands the last paper not controlled by the burns media empire. we are not afraid to say montgomery burns is a monopolistic, self-aggrandizing hmmm... stinky pants."""
42289,Lisa,"dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? check it out."
43999,Lisa,it's your fault! i accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
50068,Lisa,"there, you see?"
51462,Lisa,"more for mom, but yes."
46519,Lisa,it was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
49984,Lisa,"mr. flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?"
46844,Lisa,yes.
50859,Lisa,the black hole is looking a lot bigger. does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
45544,Lisa,"dad, it's a tobacco company. they make billions off the suffering and deaths of others."
42441,Lisa,so we'll march day and night /
46295,Lisa,you know about i.m. pei? i.m. impressed.
42899,Lisa,"look, bart. it almost killed me, but i hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from oliver twist. and now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm."
50224,Lisa,really?
47051,Lisa,who's naïve?
42168,Lisa,this is a little more rustic than i expected.
46929,Lisa,what? why?
51522,Lisa,"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
48895,Lisa,his father is a doctor...
44449,Lisa,"if they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?"
51813,Lisa,i gave it to you!
46143,Lisa,"well, dad, i think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life."
46744,Lisa,really? that's wonderful. but how?
44493,Lisa,you did. his name was stampy. you loved him.
47714,Lisa,i can't hear you.
48243,Lisa,and where should it not go?
43553,Lisa,"hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
42592,Lisa,"mom, dad! mr. burns is a vampire, and he has bart!"
50443,Lisa,"it's like five classrooms in one! a science room... student lounge... mathnasium... an experimental theater! all set for a production of samuel beckett's ""endgame""!"
48011,Lisa,dad?!
46445,Lisa,why does jesus have a lasso?
46095,Lisa,i'd love to go to the library with you.
47666,Lisa,the homer times?
50218,Lisa,"no, no... listen, don't tell anyone, but... i can't stand pigeons! they're like rats with wings!"
51244,Lisa,"i feel your pain, brother."
46154,Lisa,"otto, what are you doing?"
48752,Lisa,i've got a visual.
44997,Lisa,"it's because they are kids. and so are we. c'mon, alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open, and go days without bathing. we'll never have that freedom again."
50065,Lisa,you did?
52478,Lisa,mom... you're the best!
49593,Lisa,"thank you, but i know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty. it's called ""snow white and the seven..."""
47693,Lisa,"congratulations, mom. you seem to have a prescription for success."
44114,Lisa,grim--
48795,Lisa,"of course. gosh, dad, your hands are shaking!"
41699,Lisa,"i, i understand. mr. bergstrom, i'm going to miss you."
42552,Lisa,"hey look! ""the fbi light opera society sings the complete gilbert and sullivan."""
42544,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong with you?"
46565,Lisa,"well bart, you really understand women."
50299,Lisa,they calm down when they're near the springfield silvertongues!
45381,Lisa,you.
47081,Lisa,"look up at the stars, springfield! for eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
48535,Lisa,grampa's been watching us.
45953,Lisa,... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
47149,Lisa,that's not mom!
45898,Lisa,"dad, that's too much deterge--"
47859,Lisa,"oops, need more soda."
41593,Lisa,tell me about it. i broke up with milhouse.
47210,Lisa,but it's not too late. you can still fly to stockholm.
46269,Lisa,how could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
42591,Lisa,"yeah, i've seen your curly too."
44979,Lisa,"milhouse! i've been lookin' all over for you! listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance. pretty great, huh? see ya."
44795,Lisa,the old union pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
42925,Lisa,yeah. nice gag.
43009,Lisa,mom! mom! you've gotta help! they're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!
48616,Lisa,"uh, thank you and goodnight."
41754,Lisa,"wait, dad, he's smiling."
46856,Lisa,"bart, this is all your fault."
47162,Lisa,"look, to get our dog back, we need a plan."
46387,Lisa,we promise.
49869,Lisa,and now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
51004,Lisa,"what i'm saying applies to you too, dad."
47183,Lisa,who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
43850,Lisa,"in the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. i hope everyone still has theirs."
44408,Lisa,i admit sgt. skinner seems okay... but mr. tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
42382,Lisa,forget it. to get those tickets our parents would have to be part of springfield's cultural elite.
43302,Lisa,oh yeah.
48234,Lisa,i bet i could turn him into a proper gentleman! and i will do it in time for the school science fair!
51720,Lisa,bart! this is the year i've got to nail christmas. i don't want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you!
49615,Lisa,"dad, i keep telling you, that won't work."
51635,Lisa,"mom, it's trash talk. you know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies."
43277,Lisa,"is that what we do in this family? when someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!"
42440,Lisa,so we'll march day and night / by the big cooling tower / they have the plant / but we have the power.
46588,Lisa,grampa!
45204,Lisa,now what do we do?
52375,Lisa,"sewing a new quilt. you know, it's one thing to be a link in a chain. it's another to start one of your own."
50228,Lisa,this is where we're ditching the dog?
51194,Lisa,"dad, what's that on your lap?!"
47013,Lisa,"no, i don't want to pay for college by throwing a spelling bee."
48868,Lisa,"dad, are you okay? i see food on your plate instead of blurring motions."
44160,Lisa,bob's trailer at the construction site?
42221,Lisa,there's no way i can beat this girl. she's the jack nicklaus of the pageant circuit.
43026,Lisa,i am talking to the collection money thief. only you can come forward and end this injustice.
51599,Lisa,"great! but from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other."
48404,Lisa,this is slander! darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time!
42054,Lisa,is it that exchange student mx!pa?
49057,Lisa,of course he did. his food is laced with growth hormones.
43407,Lisa,burns' suit! burns' suit!
46363,Lisa,abraca-dairy!
42384,Lisa,now ralph is in this play with me. i just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
43224,Lisa,"yes, i will."
45276,Lisa,"ooh, my stomach hurts."
49617,Lisa,two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
50451,Lisa,"i've got to get back in that room, but skinner took away the only key! what would nancy drew do?"
50760,Lisa,that's nelson!
47226,Lisa,"well, they're transferring grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. i say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!"
50308,Lisa,and i locked the back door!
42336,Lisa,we understand.
42345,Lisa,look! it's the seven duffs!
48200,Lisa,"dad, the phantom isn't in this."
44502,Lisa,"principal skinner, remember how i didn't sue when i found that scorpion in my applesauce? well, i'm calling in a favor."
46030,Lisa,just a cotton-pickin' minute. i've been getting a's since gymboree.
41616,Lisa,in i.q. only!
45123,Lisa,i don't want your dirty denominators.
43526,Lisa,"i'm not asleep, i'm just resting my eye-- uh oh."
44823,Lisa,"aren't you gonna buy it, dad?"
50514,Lisa,she means the most authentic.
47756,Lisa,help... help... so much sulfur dioxide!
48467,Lisa,i won't get tired of him!
51327,Lisa,cakey or gooey?
44510,Lisa,it looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
45939,Lisa,"oh, you want to be with your friends."
43993,Lisa,"who does nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
45417,Lisa,"okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. principal skinner? how's your transportation project coming?"
49021,Lisa,i can't -- i promised i wouldn't.
44960,Lisa,"yes, you did! yesterday. right by my locker."
48012,Lisa,come on -- we'll hide in the theater!
44028,Lisa,"oh, i know."
48024,Lisa,"it's albanian. but the producers added subtitles to make it ""commercial."""
50053,Lisa,"ooh, a message from my small business person!"
42729,Lisa,"i've got the solution -- you and i are gonna make our own talking doll. she'll have the wisdom of gertrude stein and the wit of cathy guisewite, the tenacity of nina totenberg and the common sense of elizabeth cady stanton. and to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of eleanor roosevelt!"
49947,Lisa,"that's not true! first of all, milhouse fell because you tripped him. secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
47667,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
44071,Lisa,"i saw it, bart."
46572,Lisa,you know that new baby brother ralph's been bragging about? it's just a pinecone.
48463,Lisa,"ooh, but this one is precious!"
43278,Lisa,they don't like being broken up.
50230,Lisa,you do for me.
51638,Lisa,"hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? meat, no meat, it's all good."
41659,Lisa,i'm in a coffee house listening to poetry! there's a cat on a table and no one seems to care! this is the single greatest day of my life.
50754,Lisa,"well sure life is full of pain and drudgery, but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences we're given in the moment."
48375,Lisa,you'd do that for me? that is so sweet.
47090,Lisa,"in his sleep deprived state, he's very suggestible. okay dad, you are now playing patty-cake with maggie."
50633,Lisa,i have no friends.
52015,Lisa,no!
51393,Lisa,"no, about christmas. so i went out this morning and i got you this."
50301,Lisa,"these flowers saved me from a terrible fate -- not getting an ""a"" on my next science project!"
42339,Lisa,"goodbye, great aunt gladys. i wish i had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years."
50682,Lisa,ow!
43258,Lisa,i can't believe i'm hearing this. i don't want to cut my family out of my life.
43235,Lisa,dad!
51780,Lisa,"hi, i didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with mr. musk. it is such an honor."
50321,Lisa,cheech and chong are from springfield?
48097,Lisa,"hi, bart. i baked you some cookies."
45422,Lisa,help!
41760,Lisa,"bart, my birthday is in two days. i'm gonna be eight years old. it's a big number -- almost double digits."
44637,Lisa,knock it off. we gotta find a way to light a fire.
45867,Lisa,"little vicki, i figured out how to dance. i can be in the show now!"
49290,Lisa,"oh, it's my first mybill. twelve hundred dollars?! but i only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
49007,Lisa,fresh air.
44687,Lisa,"i don't need a hint, ralph!"
44694,Lisa,"and a spring for his curly tail! huh-huh. oink, oink, oink...huh-huh!"
49978,Lisa,another springfield family moves to detroit to find a better life.
46352,Lisa,mini toothpaste.
45090,Lisa,hmm... i wonder what's in this glowing barrel.
42835,Lisa,dad...
49474,Lisa,"look -- there's writing on the ""r!"""
42773,Lisa,a deer!
49065,Lisa,"wait! if you stop the wedding, bart's cow will die! and he really cares about that cow... and bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help."
50599,Lisa,krusty?
48009,Lisa,"bart, you look worse than aunt patty in the morning. and there ain't nothin' looks worse than aunt patty in the morning."
49417,Lisa,"no, but wait. i aced the math part, right? because..."
43928,Lisa,my god. i've created life!
41863,Lisa,"no, no. we're not converting, we just want to find a rabbi krustofsky."
45733,Lisa,what do i save?!
43385,Lisa,he robbed the school of music!
47664,Lisa,"well, at least there's nothing else burns can do to me."
50580,Lisa,gaiman!
47918,Lisa,"well, i don't care what you say, she still loves us more. don't you, snowball?"
47014,Lisa,"mom, i'm having a crisis of conscience. can you and dad afford to send me to college?"
47279,Lisa,but... but i...
44860,Lisa,oh! but isn't this the 22?
52074,Lisa,"no! don't you get it, bart? how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?"
43219,Lisa,when will the world learn?
49039,Lisa,ew!
52402,Lisa,"oh mom, i can't believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher."
45525,Lisa,"actually, he's homer simpson. that's bart. i'm lisa..."
49282,Lisa,i'm a mapple person!
46316,Lisa,there's nothing here.
52008,Lisa,"why don't you watch ""krusty the clown""?"
45085,Lisa,"mom, no, wait! we can make a deal!"
46456,Lisa,"mom, i know it's you."
42269,Lisa,uh... i think it needs a little padding.
44783,Lisa,"zork? what is ""zork""?"
47117,Lisa,"""on this battleground in 1881, fifty-six indians lost their lives and four brave americans lost their hats."""
44901,Lisa,"it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!"
43511,Lisa,"hey, what's that in his footprint?"
49766,Lisa,thank you!
42302,Lisa,mommy.
46763,Lisa,"dad, make him stop!"
51397,Lisa,"thanks, bart. this'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
52438,Lisa,when?
51365,Lisa,"krusty, are you broke?"
49995,Lisa,isn't this exciting?
45058,Lisa,"dad, you gotta get us out of here! use the remote!"
47056,Lisa,"i got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive."
45522,Lisa,"mom, make him stop."
43115,Lisa,don't you see? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
45168,Lisa,"with a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
48948,Lisa,but bart...
47502,Lisa,it's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on tv.
50804,Lisa,"you! it's about hello, hello, springfield. it's me, gaga! why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
51324,Lisa,"just can't resist those words ""signup sheet."" oh, looks like i'll be running against isabel. and ralph?!"
49142,Lisa,mitzi gaynor?
44183,Lisa,once there was a robot named todd...
50501,Lisa,"bart, you wanna see something cool?"
47879,Lisa,how dare you make light of that brutal--
52208,Lisa,why do i get the feeling that someday i'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
46008,Lisa,and coloring easter eggs!
47503,Lisa,because mr. flanders volunteered to take the senior citizens out for ice cream.
50439,Lisa,could this key open...
49166,Lisa,toora loora lie
42000,Lisa,"hey, the new sign is really working."
49873,Lisa,"krusty, i've been meaning to ask, what are you doing on this tour?"
44301,Lisa,"not good money, really. each can'll get you a nickel."
51167,Lisa,happy birthday dad! / happy birthday grampa!
51090,Lisa,and do you think this boy took those eggs?
51252,Lisa,"if every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system."
43199,Lisa,"sorry, i don't believe in fortune telling. i should go."
52096,Lisa,finally!
43520,Lisa,"oh my god! bart, groundskeeper willie was in my nightmare, too! but he got me with hedge-clippers!"
41596,Lisa,armpit noises are not a language.
41637,Lisa,"well, well, well. look who's come crawlin' back."
47567,Lisa,"no. we're gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they don't have one moment of fun."
42891,Lisa,"i've got to stop being so petty. i should be allison's friend, not her competitor. i mean, she is a wonderful person."
51461,Lisa,you're going to take dna from these historical figures and add it to your own?
45861,Lisa,but my parents are counting on seeing me dance! and i've worked ever so hard.
49590,Lisa,"please, i just want to go back to a place where i'm ostracized for being me, not for who i pretend to be."
51535,Lisa,"no penalty! he dove, dad!"
47992,Lisa,dad looks so happy.
51785,Lisa,bye!
51453,Lisa,i like the impressionists.
51003,Lisa,"ew! on every level! ew! bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of milhice. what? it's the plural of milhouse. look it up."
49412,Lisa,"dad, bart's throwing away his future!"
43971,Lisa,"hey, i think i got a pai gow!"
43228,Lisa,"mom, it's a picture phone."
48518,Lisa,who was that?
49964,Lisa,you're blond too.
46428,Lisa,try to remember back when you were twelve. something frightening must have happened.
51214,Lisa,girl scout cookies get you in anywhere.
42467,Lisa,"write a cartoon ourselves? bart, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
49572,Lisa,bart! your plan worked!
42418,Lisa,"mom, bart wrecked my project and the science fair's in three days!"
52463,Lisa,there must be some way out of this verdammten spell.
47735,Lisa,"chloe, i really admire how you got out of springfield and became such a success."
51851,Lisa,they never let poor rudolph / join in any reindeer games...
47154,Lisa,"here's a role model for you, boy: rin tin tin. he was brave on and off the screen. he was the first openly gay dog in hollywood."
43015,Lisa,"no, bart. i just think you and jessica are too different from each other to get along. she's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
42033,Lisa,isn't it though?
50834,Lisa,but...
50679,Lisa,"man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it."
45844,Lisa,"she's not plain, she's beautiful!"
52176,Lisa,"read the bosom part again, dad."
46118,Lisa,"i'll call poison control. fran, it's me. just a heads-up."
51197,Lisa,"chief, is there really a terrorist threat to springfield?"
47968,Lisa,how did you write a song so quickly?
50787,Lisa,"so, when's the party?"
44797,Lisa,"that's what veterans day is for, bart."
51951,Lisa,"sorry, dad. i know you mean well."
46835,Lisa,you die now!
47422,Lisa,"ooh, we're like howard carter discovering the temple of tutankhamen."
44302,Lisa,there's a can.
52496,Lisa,"uh, what are you cooking?"
49202,Lisa,i'll take ten bucks no-ow.
49143,Lisa,krusty klovnen baby visker?
44954,Lisa,but i don't think i'm ready for pierced ears.
48563,Lisa,"thank you, thank you, thank you!"
50736,Lisa,i don't think shauna should choose any of you. shauna should choose shauna.
49849,Lisa,congratulations. you're officially a sociopath.
43037,Lisa,ooooh.
45553,Lisa,"sure! you can help me find three words where ""y"" is the vowel."
47395,Lisa,maybe you should let dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
44517,Lisa,"dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. there's no proof of that."
48806,Lisa,look at the crowd around that table.
44513,Lisa,"well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
45472,Lisa,"who are ""they,"" exactly?"
42724,Lisa,change what she says. it's your company.
43899,Lisa,you cost me my only friends! you ruined my life!
43237,Lisa,are you okay?
48136,Lisa,stupid dad. doesn't care about my feelings...
52368,Lisa,"mom, what will we do if santa's little helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school?"
52441,Lisa,mr. bergstrom!
46185,Lisa,hi there.
47301,Lisa,"dad, you rear-ended the queen of england!"
42892,Lisa,i prefer my phrasing.
49399,Lisa,"dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better."
42795,Lisa,you started off as the bad cop. but now you're the good one. you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
47449,Lisa,they just painted the tower brown.
42043,Lisa,"you think you know fear? well, i've seen them naked."
44026,Lisa,what?
46751,Lisa,but i like my old name.
43445,Lisa,where'd you get five bucks? i want five bucks.
42608,Lisa,"mr. hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?"
49248,Lisa,"hey, there are no lenses in these glasses..."
48770,Lisa,"my god, that's a class-five stench-dispersal unit! we have to short out that fan."
51139,Lisa,"hey, i have a weakness for pomp!"
52031,Lisa,"sorry, bart. i'd love to help you but i'm mired in stage five, self-pity."
46702,Lisa,"well, i can't argue with the man who wrote ""profiles in courage."""
43782,Lisa,"hmm... you could travel for free if you were a stewardess. well, how badly do you want to get home? all right, all right, how about a courier? they travel for free, too. no, that's a terrier. they're dogs."
43891,Lisa,"well, we could do something fun. um, how 'bout a beach party?"
46962,Lisa,"hmm, this is an interesting old book."
45873,Lisa,"oh, thanks, dad."
47239,Lisa,i rest my case.
43238,Lisa,"uh, mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?"
49271,Lisa,and master puzzle constructor merl reagle?!
48290,Lisa,"dad, you can't keep this up for long."
50818,Lisa,i was small inside and lacking pride...
46091,Lisa,"excuse me, but isn't that voice very similar to the cowardly lion?"
45611,Lisa,"no, bart, he's right. i did oversimplify."
44471,Lisa,"mom, mom. i stepped in a bear trap."
51118,Lisa,chocolate or regular?
47692,Lisa,yes.
47701,Lisa,"that's right, a double-dogleg, hamstring-knotting hop-way to hell. what insane kangaroo dreamed this fevered nightmare? behold!"
50369,Lisa,my friends call me lisa.
47702,Lisa,"ladies, grab your pebbles!"
50654,Lisa,"as i was saying, springface was used in ways i never expected."
52508,Lisa,you finally reached emotional maturity. unlike bart.
49443,Lisa,"wait, i have an idea! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
44529,Lisa,but they are morons. what grown person could believe in angels?
42516,Lisa,"oh mom, i've missed you so much."
47005,Lisa,"i guess i'll have to. then i'll be queen of the world! of spelling. that's right, queen of the world! of spelling."
43039,Lisa,"cut it out, bart!"
42491,Lisa,but killing snakes is evil.
52356,Lisa,arithmetic.
50841,Lisa,"not so fast! we came for shakespeare, and we're gonna see shakespeare!"
50861,Lisa,"stop! this is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! if one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass!"
43834,Lisa,"bart, these look real."
47850,Lisa,baaart!
52048,Lisa,"can, too."
51985,Lisa,no.
47115,Lisa,just hear those sleigh bells jingling / ring-ting-tingling too...

50276,Lisa,i've been doing the family's books for years. i take what i need.
45786,Lisa,"no, just keep him out of my hair."
47218,Lisa,don't go inside -- it's a trap!
45795,Lisa,"thanks bart, you bought us some time. what can i do to thank you?"
45269,Lisa,"dad, will you please tell bart to stop squeaking his chair. i'm trying to do my homework."
50724,Lisa,we'll take your word for it.
48650,Lisa,"mr. spuckler, wait! is this really good for your kids?"
49091,Lisa,what are you boys doing on the foley stage?
43792,Lisa,"mom, dad threw his beer can at the miracle gro guy on tv. can i recycle it?"
44008,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm so sorry..."
47409,Lisa,"oh, i can't stand it."
45982,Lisa,aren't you coming with me?
52361,Lisa,ow!
48957,Lisa,don't you weasel out on me!
48308,Lisa,it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
50284,Lisa,"mom, your choice to go back to blue is so empowering."
43732,Lisa,so it's true. some cartoons do encourage violence.
50846,Lisa,"hey, don't ever stop, because tonight we made it in new york!"
41733,Lisa,"hey, they do look alike!"
51622,Lisa,"if you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will."
49300,Lisa,"but dad, bees pollinate flowers."
43112,Lisa,"remember, dad. all glory is fleeting."
51018,Lisa,i get it. middle child. never do what i want.
50139,Lisa,"edmund's almost here, so please nobody be themselves!"

48407,Lisa,"they're making us learn creation theory in school. today we had a test, and every answer was ""god did it."""
52359,Lisa,"oh, but i don't know how to sew."

52399,Lisa,mommy! i want my mommy!
48532,Lisa,i'd like that. i'd like it a lot.
43216,Lisa,"yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings."
41878,Lisa,yahhh!
51031,Lisa,kirk? don't you have something to tell her?
44389,Lisa,"dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
51112,Lisa,i think our lunches got mixed up.
48992,Lisa,oh. oh.
42875,Lisa,"well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? make a few calls on my behalf? maybe you could've been ""nicer"" to principal skinner, if you know what i mean."
43823,Lisa,that's it!

50705,Lisa,"dad, i wanted to give you a heads-up. mom's birthday is tomorrow. it's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting."
45120,Lisa,"mom, where did you get that?"
42453,Lisa,is a coma painful?
51618,Lisa,"which meant that at long last, my brother could get a good night's sleep."

43405,Lisa,this suit burns better. look.

50082,Lisa,but i'm only in second grade.
50114,Lisa,"...so because of your on-base percentage, nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. questions?"
45833,Lisa,ewww.
50811,Lisa,gaga!
45256,Lisa,"yeah, well, i hope it doesn't hum too loud, 'cause i have a ton of homework to do, and if i don't finish it by..."
52377,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna learn it now. don't spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature. have some fun, frolic with him. go get it, boy!"
50295,Lisa,i believe it's from lamps plus.
51837,Lisa,but mom had to spend all the christmas money having it surgically removed.
50198,Lisa,"we're called ""little people"" and i'm not one."
50497,Lisa,"""you are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. for further communication i will require more beans. i love you, baby."""
50751,Lisa,this stupid prank is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
41685,Lisa,you're the tail!
48700,Lisa,this is what i think of your yellow card!
49715,Lisa,oh no! you took too long to make an obvious decision!
46673,Lisa,wait! what about maggie's memories? surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind.
48898,Lisa,"it was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!"
43311,Lisa,"mom, i think he's serious."
52396,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
50862,Lisa,noooo!
47895,Lisa,oh boy. let's get out of here before dad does a bad impression of mom.
50449,Lisa,"and now without further ado, i give you... this!!!"
42390,Lisa,what if he...
42136,Lisa,dad! dad! do you know what today is?
46176,Lisa,bart's got a problem!
48640,Lisa,the hillbilly tykes will become my tutees!
47045,Lisa,that's jelly.
42575,Lisa,"dad, i wouldn't go outside if i were you."
42226,Lisa,do you really think i can win?
42923,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
46177,Lisa,there's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. bob dylan wrote songs. cesar chavez staged hunger strikes.
46201,Lisa,why does she only go after the smart ones?
44084,Lisa,"wow, mom, look at all those customers!"
50850,Lisa,a mini black hole!
47105,Lisa,hello... hold on.
41735,Lisa,he's no wittier than the next superhero.
43938,Lisa,your world is incredible! and you speak english!
43271,Lisa,"can we keep santa's girlfriend, mom?"
44030,Lisa,very sharp!
50471,Lisa,"well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
52235,Lisa,"was it because you hate me, or because you're bad?"
46188,Lisa,"they're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. but it might work."
49237,Lisa,citywide crossword tournament!
49389,Lisa,"dad, you ran for class president?"
46504,Lisa,take it back! take it back!
43913,Lisa,"bart, do you think it's safe?"
43326,Lisa,i stopped brushing my teeth so i can play just like you!
51678,Lisa,y-e-e-e-s.
51997,Lisa,"should maggie be going with them, mom?"
48857,Lisa,"oh really? the more you deny it, the more i know it's true."
42629,Lisa,"oh, bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
46031,Lisa,you gave bart one.
50839,Lisa,"well, at least i'll be able to say i went to a broadway show."
45395,Lisa,"""we read your letter with great interest. if you wish to learn more, go to 13 euclid street. tell no one! and bring a dessert."""
47408,Lisa,okay.
45987,Lisa,"well, um, i was thinking of going vegan!"
44950,Lisa,"they only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... oh, and get this, mom, she drinks iced tea."
48147,Lisa,"dad, we've got to do something."
42909,Lisa,"after the way i've behaved, i don't deserve to win."
44091,Lisa,we'll help you.
50421,Lisa,that's the first thing everyone knows about kyle lobianco!
51240,Lisa,why bart? i thought we were friends!
47909,Lisa,"for your information, springfielders can be intelligent and articulate. i happen to know because we're from springfield."
45155,Lisa,hi.
44372,Lisa,"meet me at the eliminator"" after lights out. p.s. the cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
43603,Lisa,thanks.
43989,Lisa,you've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. why would she leave you now?
42029,Lisa,"if i still love you, dallas. if i don't, buffalo."
44971,Lisa,hello?
46084,Lisa,yay!
43671,Lisa,"oh, it's just the excitement of studying jebediah."
51160,Lisa,ki-ya karate monsters!
49939,Lisa,dad? where did you get that boat?
50278,Lisa,"i love it. i know i use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
49229,Lisa,"""eye care!"" ""optician's concern."" oh, thanks for your help, bart! ""bart?"" ""san francisco people mover!"""
45815,Lisa,ow!
41805,Lisa,"""i will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws."" amen, sister."
49651,Lisa,"apu, how did you survive?"
45513,Lisa,"your collecting days are over, collector..."
47302,Lisa,why did you let him be his own barrister?
48197,Lisa,"dad, you're driving on an ancient roman aqueduct!"
50742,Lisa,kidzone... let me guess: a broken foosball table and a game of clue missing its candlestick.
51802,Lisa,we did it! we wrote an awesome song!
47806,Lisa,and they seem awfully chummy.
42956,Lisa,who are all these characters?
43515,Lisa,but people can't help looking at them. they're wrecking the town.
47463,Lisa,i already have one of those.
50616,Lisa,you're endorsing ted nugent for president?! he's a right-wing rock star who likes everything i hate!
44194,Lisa,certainly.
44528,Lisa,"ugh, those morons make me so angry."
43660,Lisa,but we saw your plane crash...
42189,Lisa,sorry.
46567,Lisa,"oh, bart, it's human nature. you only want her because someone else has her."
44069,Lisa,not me.
43964,Lisa,what are you talking about?
44952,Lisa,"hm, don't give it a second thought. i didn't."
48057,Lisa,this stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!
42166,Lisa,i'll write you every day.
51663,Lisa,flaming tap water. i saw something about that in a documentary...
48436,Lisa,mom!
48449,Lisa,yes?
45452,Lisa,i think we all had that idea.
45003,Lisa,there you are in outer space. that's pretty impressive.
49162,Lisa,i'm trying to set you up for laughs.
42942,Lisa,can we?
43874,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever. like, you know, whatever."
48600,Lisa,"milhouse, don't you see... you're addicted to revenge."
45579,Lisa,"don't you think there's something weird going on here? we spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""phil from marketing""."
45731,Lisa,i just want to tell you how proud i am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
48355,Lisa,"mom, the girls' school is a joke and i'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
47887,Lisa,compress his chest!
44407,Lisa,"and he survived to make it back to springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
51254,Lisa,"i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it. milhouse?"
49232,Lisa,"grampa, everyone knows that the only real test of skill is the new york times puzzle, edited by will shortz!"
42431,Lisa,"please, mother. it's purely in the interest of science."
51559,Lisa,"so, mr. burns never realized it was maggie who saved the plant?"
44703,Lisa,this is crazy! just because you and dad and bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it?
44271,Lisa,"a credit card? oh, i knew you were up to no good."
43372,Lisa,"bust 'im, mom! / get 'im, mom! / nail 'im! / you can do it!"
41666,Lisa,why did i have to lie about my heritage? by speaking with forked tongue i am in heap big trouble. and now i'm thinking in stereotypes? that's even worse!
51024,Lisa,"thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad."
49032,Lisa,where's all the money?
51544,Lisa,what does a competitive eater eat?
43522,Lisa,"bart, don't you realize what this means? the next time we fall asleep we could die!"
45400,Lisa,wow! i'm so honored you wanted me.
41891,Lisa,i'll give you a candy necklace.
51468,Lisa,"dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat grampa?"
51952,Lisa,no. not really.
44822,Lisa,yes.
41588,Lisa,not every question!
46586,Lisa,"dad, i'm on the line."
51962,Lisa,i've got to find that sound.
49498,Lisa,dunkilderry is so quaint! it looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.
49133,Lisa,"yay, bart!"
47588,Lisa,"dad, please. it's obvious you're pie man. we've been getting his mail for weeks."
42987,Lisa,"look! prudence goodwyfe, died 1641. she voted for bob, too! so did buddy holly, richie valens, and the big bopper!"
42609,Lisa,"don't worry, mr. hutz is still here to take care of us."
46014,Lisa,i'll just rest here for a minute.
50069,Lisa,i used grampa's money to try to help someone in need. but it didn't go the way i expected.
51037,Lisa,i know. it's weird to me too.
50572,Lisa,and they're letting me write the sequel! a hard deadline is just the kick in the pants i need to focus and get some serious writing done!
48233,Lisa,bart! willie could have a better life! if only someone showed him how...
46282,Lisa,i knew that. just testing.
46416,Lisa,that means dad's not a kidnapper. he's a hostage.
48135,Lisa,i'd rather not go than lie.
46466,Lisa,richard gere?
47820,Lisa,"they stopped saying ""keepin' it real"" three years ago."
44249,Lisa,aren't you afraid i might take drugs and injure your children?
49908,Lisa,we're gonna go check out the wind damage!
47442,Lisa,bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd. no one calls me a nerd.
49216,Lisa,um... i think it's... we don't have one.
52204,Lisa,"mom, bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. steak will make him logy."
44607,Lisa,"i was wrong about the cooders, dad. they're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home."
44296,Lisa,"no, i'm not!"
49770,Lisa,all dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
49753,Lisa,"all right, it's all hooked up."
43563,Lisa,there. now no one should be able to hear us.
42497,Lisa,yeah.
49196,Lisa,you're just digging yourself even deeper.
48583,Lisa,"oooh, an institute!"
48562,Lisa,really?
45768,Lisa,i can't relax! being president is hard work. maybe you should try doing something with your life.
42640,Lisa,"mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and i don't know which state to go as."
47194,Lisa,"mom, it's ""wind."""
44211,Lisa,i didn't see any u.f.o.!
50457,Lisa,"what do you think of that, nancy drew?"
47421,Lisa,"look, we can go inside!"
45420,Lisa,i don't remember discussing that.
43888,Lisa,"don't be afraid, little friend. you'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
47394,Lisa,"""captain mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes. 'mmm, blowholes,' he drooled."" sounds like dad to me."
46634,Lisa,please don't be mad. i've been sponsoring an orphan boy in brazil.
46101,Lisa,"oh, many things: tai chi, chai tea... but i find, when i can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk."
50602,Lisa,"you need an agent? we met a ten percenter today. she'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. you'll have a skein on the sked before you can say ""krusty's wardrobe furnished by ha-has of beverly hills""."
49552,Lisa,"i've never been called ""fierce"" before. ""strident..."" ""hectoring"" has been tossed around..."
51126,Lisa,no. nobody did.
49601,Lisa,so snow white slept and waited for her prince to come... but he never did.
41934,Lisa,"dad, can you take me to dr. hibbert's office?"
43122,Lisa,why don't we all look at the photo album?
41994,Lisa,"point well taken. uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
51319,Lisa,so... you were going through a phase?
44649,Lisa,the defense has just one more question.
42157,Lisa,"no, dad. you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty. and with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
49346,Lisa,juliet's father is the world's foremost john grisham scholar.
47249,Lisa,"make it snappy, milhouse. i've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge."
44662,Lisa,"hey... if a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food."
47975,Lisa,"no, we did it, dad."
48552,Lisa,what's wrong?
52486,Lisa,i open this door and i go from being one kind of mother to another.
51827,Lisa,--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
51395,Lisa,i sold the gift you gave me.
47964,Lisa,"nicely done, wind-dancer. but seriously, cruelty to animals is no laughing matter. you can make a difference!"
42412,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
51586,Lisa,"oh god, i'm gonna be sick!"
46448,Lisa,that's it!
45070,Lisa,where'd you get that muffin?
48971,Lisa,i can't take it anymore! the stress is killing me! i'm on a freight train to crazytown!
45268,Lisa,ohhh! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it!
45973,Lisa,don't you call me a--
43382,Lisa,"dad, how can you work for a man like mr. burns?"
45698,Lisa,"no, something fresh and bold."
47685,Lisa,come on mom! you still have twenty minutes left -- you can fix it!
42621,Lisa,"it's simple, bart. you've defined yourself as a rebel. and in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."
49330,Lisa,do we have any more paints? my orange isn't the orange of that orange.
47630,Lisa,thank you. geezer rock -- an appreciation in verse.
46263,Lisa,oh no! it's the poachers!
43467,Lisa,no!
51790,Lisa,i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.
47955,Lisa,"it's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces."
51903,Lisa,we would if we had one.
51320,Lisa,what are you trying to say?
46051,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't drag that around."
49911,Lisa,"bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?"
49263,Lisa,i'm through with crosswords! my innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes.
51231,Lisa,"a gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. it doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. so if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
51030,Lisa,"well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
44953,Lisa,"oh, earrings! wow, thank you so much, alex. but these are for pierced ears."
45318,Lisa,"it's a plague, you moron! and we've got lots more planned, and there's nothing you can do about it!"
46532,Lisa,these are so easy. it's obviously tom hanks.
43429,Lisa,that was a baby tooth... it was loose...
48816,Lisa,shout!
46825,Lisa,one last sunbeam... and we're done.
48298,Lisa,"wow, there's a rainbow outside."
45517,Lisa,oh.
42871,Lisa,"wow, with so much in common, i'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
42700,Lisa,"i'm warning you, mom -- i may get a little crazy."
52434,Lisa,no. homework's not my father's specialty.
42937,Lisa,that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
42778,Lisa,dad!
41819,Lisa,bart!
49996,Lisa,"why aren't i going to oslo? the nobel prizes are my freakin' thing! but no -- bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy. and maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby. meanwhile, i'll just stand and wave to people going to better places."
45584,Lisa,i don't understand. i could swear it was right here.
43628,Lisa,the rich are different from you and me.
51401,Lisa,it's almost like having dad here. only with less growling when i go near his food.
52431,Lisa,fine.
50978,Lisa,"so, how's the studying going?"
48853,Lisa,"oh, milhouse! you're very brave."
45174,Lisa,hippo in the house.
44011,Lisa,well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
45741,Lisa,i hope they're hover-bikes.
42085,Lisa,a doy.
45057,Lisa,look!
45753,Lisa,the country is broke? how can that be?
51407,Lisa,they've found us!
51221,Lisa,i can complete my dad's mission just like george w. bush.
51623,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
49355,Lisa,"we're at the end of chapter four. but we need a grabber, a whammy, a snap-a-roo, some eye mustard... i've got it! how 'bout this? what if queen helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn!"
49332,Lisa,"um, excuse me, but i think her painting is very imaginative."
44448,Lisa,hey! it worked!
47509,Lisa,"must be the pipes. what do you think, bart?"
44542,Lisa,"well, there you go. i hope you all learned a val--"
52049,Lisa,"can, too."
48161,Lisa,"arrivedérci, ignorance!"
50390,Lisa,"dad, aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
46831,Lisa,"they left without you too, you idiot."
42149,Lisa,i see your point.
51099,Lisa,and so i've learned that the only true batmen are christian bale and adam west. why are you washing bumblebee man's pants?
45807,Lisa,that picture's a cliché .
46331,Lisa,and i've got a rally for take back the afternoon.
43976,Lisa,"...and we'd be doing our part for the environment! plus, we'd get to clean up all those cute animals."
41875,Lisa,bart! i am not gonna learn ancient hebrew.
42674,Lisa,impaled on my nobel peace prize. how ironic.
51815,Lisa,rubik's cube!
50935,Lisa,"okay, mom. i think that's far enough."
50386,Lisa,"wait, i know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. but he doesn't deserve to die."
43025,Lisa,"there is someone among us with a guilty conscience. after much soul searching i decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but i urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of god, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
49014,Lisa,when's our next break?
47915,Lisa,this is worse than when we thought mom was having an affair. it turned out she was just going to the library to cry.
42861,Lisa,"sorry, ralph. that would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation."
46090,Lisa,"wait, i'm confused. why was a wolf shooting a web?"
41676,Lisa,is it possible i've met a teacher who doesn't like me?!
45738,Lisa,"yeah, wish i could be entertained by two cents worth of rubber, shaped like some colorful animal, dancing and twirling, dancing and twirling..."
52346,Lisa,the mouse is named itchy.
50289,Lisa,angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
52172,Lisa,capital city -- yeah!
51922,Lisa,"you weren't thinking, were you?"
47296,Lisa,can you tell me what happens at the end of the series?
45809,Lisa,is that rainier wolfcastle?
49473,Lisa,mr. burns! what are you doing here?
44400,Lisa,kickin' it! a musical journey through the betty ford center.
44323,Lisa,it's the longest possible time before more church.
48612,Lisa,"today the hitachees have dwindled to a handful, and our detailed genealogical records were cruelly destroyed by the white man. so, any attempts to research my tribe would be the ultimate insult."
45715,Lisa,"now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. everything we pack in, we pack out."
48025,Lisa,i feel so much empathy for those villagers. they had to drink their own tears...
50678,Lisa,nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths!
52068,Lisa,"no, why?"
48627,Lisa,i made it all up! there is no hitachee tribe! i took the name from my microwave! but surely you can forgive a little girl who--
42924,Lisa,glad you liked it.
50261,Lisa,"come on, bart. afraid of a little apple juice?"
42904,Lisa,"bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
48607,Lisa,"bart, stop that. native americans are a proud people with a noble heritage... a noble heritage that anyone can claim!"
44614,Lisa,"oh, i can't watch."
45350,Lisa,yep!
44192,Lisa,"bart, i know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but i'm not some ogre. i think you will find me fair and fun."
41974,Lisa,"look, dad. i made a modest studio apartment for my malibu stacey doll. this is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
42760,Lisa,you ate it too fast.
45260,Lisa,"i can't believe you did this, dad. why didn't you put that thing in your room?"
41926,Lisa,"dad, i understand the sacrifice you've made for me. that's why i gave up the pony."
42468,Lisa,"according to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
49879,Lisa,krav maga!
42585,Lisa,whoops. bart and i have to go wash up.
47566,Lisa,those horn-dogs -- they ditched us again! you know what this means?
48000,Lisa,"i'm sorry i hurt you, but please don't be sad / you're no longer my coach, but you're always my dad..."
44157,Lisa,and vice versa.
44781,Lisa,"i don't need a co-anchor. i'm a straight ""a"" student."
42950,Lisa,"okay, bye-bye / bye / bye, grampa."
44843,Lisa,it's lisa. i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i take the bus to the museum?
51508,Lisa,"but, you still, i mean... i suppose you're right."
48374,Lisa,"not yet. if i do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
49661,Lisa,i'm here! come find me! olly-olly-oxen-free! olly-olly-oxen-free!
50001,Lisa,oh my god! mom! thank you! i just need my...
48924,Lisa,goodbye! / see ya later!
50977,Lisa,it's bart.
47860,Lisa,"mom, i don't mean to be mean. but every time i think about forgiving him, i remember all the bad things he's done to me."
52099,Lisa,"quiet, bart. let's make the best of this."
42314,Lisa,did too.
42409,Lisa,i've got something for you.
49574,Lisa,really?
50489,Lisa,"i'll recite the alphabet, and you tell me when to stop. a-b-c-d..."
45482,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry the editor didn't like your review."
48889,Lisa,feet? killing?! we gotta save bart!
47870,Lisa,"no, i'm giving it up!"
47568,Lisa,i'm going into the gold medallion club... with silver-level membership!
48652,Lisa,"krusty, the spuckler kids missed their reading class today."
47383,Lisa,you're not hurt! you're a good-luck kitty!
48065,Lisa,"dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
49386,Lisa,...we have received your manuscript 'the chronicles of equalia'...
44483,Lisa,"mom, please, we're eating!"
52303,Lisa,"well, don't you remember the eighth commandment?"
50938,Lisa,"willie, i love your chaps."
51564,Lisa,"well, that's a relief."
47749,Lisa,bart! thanks for helping me make up my mind.
50281,Lisa,help! my macaroni marconi!
44348,Lisa,look at how disciplined they are. they're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian.
44455,Lisa,hey look. it's pelé!
46858,Lisa,"actually, i saw them earlier and i was working on it in the hall."
46455,Lisa,"lord, i'm not turning my back on you. i just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
51269,Lisa,did you know some historians think american football is based on an ancient aztec game?
46887,Lisa,dad's heading straight for the museum of swordfish!
47167,Lisa,"now's your chance, duffman! you can save my dad and look like a hero!"
52408,Lisa,pass the moo juice.
43274,Lisa,wow! twenty-five puppies!
44839,Lisa,wait! you promised to take me to the museum!
51174,Lisa,there... carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside reykjavik.
51521,Lisa,he worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
47010,Lisa,i'm not throwing a spelling bee! i'll die before i misspell.
49470,Lisa,that's tonight!
42633,Lisa,"judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named mindy... or a man named andy."
50747,Lisa,"like monks during the dark ages, it's up to the kidzone: elite to make a record of human culture."
52524,Lisa,"now, where is the google door?"
51435,Lisa,"overreactor dot org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are ""genetically modified organisms,"" whose effect on humans is... unknown!"
45572,Lisa,"aw, the zoning disk is warped..."
46289,Lisa,"thanks, mr. teeny!"
45990,Lisa,"oh, thank you, thank you!"
50122,Lisa,"no! no, don't steal!"
51162,Lisa,ki-ya!
44983,Lisa,you don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.
51845,Lisa,"a dog! all right, dad!"
52391,Lisa,i'll name her princess and i'll ride her every day.
48675,Lisa,"dad, that's ridiculous."
52443,Lisa,ewww. gross.
44110,Lisa,"if maggie's fussy, don't avoid her."
52388,Lisa,challenge accepted!
42916,Lisa,"mom, romance is dead. it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney. homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
45648,Lisa,"hey mom, how's the leg?..."
50025,Lisa,but arts camp encouraged us to spread our wings and fly.
51948,Lisa,i'm too sad.
48586,Lisa,repent! repent! before it's too late! i always wanted to do that in a new england church.
45670,Lisa,i tricked them into thinking they had leprosy.
49965,Lisa,dye! dye! dye!
46605,Lisa,"what are you laughing at, dad?"
51247,Lisa,"eh, bart, bart, bart."
46973,Lisa,"oh, i'm gonna miss you."
44629,Lisa,it's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
49080,Lisa,yeah. getting back to my grade...
41864,Lisa,i didn't know that.
44740,Lisa,doctor?
45880,Lisa,bart sleeps with raggedy andy.
48723,Lisa,then i guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
48820,Lisa,a little bit louder now!
41713,Lisa,i don't have any banana.
51472,Lisa,"i've never had a pet of my very own! my clock is ticking! i don't wanna be one of those girls who waits till she's sixteen to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late."
41665,Lisa,"they're looking at me! all right, lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs."
47291,Lisa,how come?
43804,Lisa,i love it! i finally look like a real person! thanks!
51609,Lisa,"as the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods."
42945,Lisa,we're going to itchy and scratchy land!
52065,Lisa,"snap out of it, bart. face the facts. all those hours we spent staring at krusty, we were staring at a crook."
45778,Lisa,"uh, this is my brother bart, who doesn't seem to realize this isn't the best time for his music. he's one of the people i want to help with my programs."
45217,Lisa,that's not a fairy tale. it's just something that happened to you at moe's.
51567,Lisa,wha--?!
49023,Lisa,"all right, that's enough!"
45548,Lisa,now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
42854,Lisa,"bart, i'm here for you but, i'm not gonna break into somebody's house."
45989,Lisa,"oh, it's so decomposed! do you think i could join dirt first?"
51321,Lisa,"listen, i'm really sorry about..."
47234,Lisa,i'm doomed.
43952,Lisa,oooh!
44821,Lisa,"yeah dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize."
44943,Lisa,"now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
49578,Lisa,even the ralph of this school speaks french!
42002,Lisa,"yeah, me!"
48270,Lisa,you worked at moe's?
49339,Lisa,"what is this, brooklyn in the fifties? don't just say stuff."
46649,Lisa,how to loot brazil?
43374,Lisa,i don't even want any. i just bought a pity glass...
51068,Lisa,we don't have the metric system.
50952,Lisa,no matter where you go... i will find you!
49445,Lisa,hello. i'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. may i join your order?
51179,Lisa,are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
42130,Lisa,did the maniac kill her?
51131,Lisa,"aw, that's sweet."
49423,Lisa,"oh well, maybe it'll be more fun to be a regular, average, stay-at-home..."
46926,Lisa,lady penelope ariel-ponyweather.
48634,Lisa,"lisa simpson, with the school paper."
49117,Lisa,doctor.
46853,Lisa,"dad, what is that?"
49120,Lisa,ceo!
43119,Lisa,"dad, that doesn't help people."
44633,Lisa,"point of order. if we want to learn anything, we must respect..."
47225,Lisa,she was acquitted. then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
50664,Lisa,you have a way with words.
44802,Lisa,"""bart's show."" if everybody knew what a phony bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... i've got it!"
41854,Lisa,why don't we let our guest do it?
51036,Lisa,why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? that's how young people date these days.
43985,Lisa,"mom, calm down. the party's not for another three hours."
43926,Lisa,ah.
51610,Lisa,"while bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our pop's brainpan."
46296,Lisa,as in monk?
44104,Lisa,we'll find a way. mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. i'll stop buying malibu stacey clothing.
51236,Lisa,/
50113,Lisa,i don't know... yes.
47913,Lisa,i'll bet she's sneaking food from someplace else! let's follow her!
43443,Lisa,oh boy! really?
48713,Lisa,"bart, come with me. i'll take you to someone who will make you feel better."
51901,Lisa,"no, dad! please don't pawn the tv!"
48545,Lisa,haw haw!
49765,Lisa,excuse me? i think this fell off your hat.
41842,Lisa,hey there ten-year old. i couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
50415,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but i don't love you, milhouse, and i never will."
48043,Lisa,how is that possible?
45349,Lisa,a banana!
46013,Lisa,aww.
48628,Lisa,"yes, you should've!"
42301,Lisa,i wish we lived in the kitty house.
48657,Lisa,"check out this pinball machine! ""chevy chase in 'foul play'."""
43528,Lisa,"you saved us, maggie!"
47531,Lisa,"c'mon bart, here's our chance."
42615,Lisa,"um... uh, well... uh..."
51465,Lisa,what? no!
44677,Lisa,"actually, we can't take a bath anyway. the water heater is broken."
42524,Lisa,no they don't.
41980,Lisa,he said denver just fumbled.
48113,Lisa,dad! dad! wake up! you're not a robot!
51840,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
47069,Lisa,"oh dad, look at this one!"
52057,Lisa,with all our hearts!
43348,Lisa,"mom, i want to honor bleeding gums' memory, but i don't know where to start."
44250,Lisa,"oh, um, i'm sorry. can you hold on, please... hello?"
42936,Lisa,that didn't seem like a happy ending.
49598,Lisa,...lenny!
52054,Lisa,"look, mom. there he is."
48348,Lisa,are we gonna do any actual math problems?
43776,Lisa,okay. i like...
43890,Lisa,"no. no, i heard it on ""baywatch."""
52170,Lisa,"i can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something."
43580,Lisa,da-ad! why aren't you looking?
52421,Lisa,"no, but i'm starting to wish i had."
51968,Lisa,okay.
42064,Lisa,"no, i want to get him a beer."
47141,Lisa,run across!
44657,Lisa,look! we can hide in that cave!
46109,Lisa,da-ad!
45424,Lisa,even you?
46749,Lisa,"""screamapillar care tips."" wow, look at all this stuff. ""without constant reassurance, it will die. it's sexually attracted to fire..."""
51528,Lisa,"dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!"
44106,Lisa,we have our own suggestions for the new nanny. would you like to hear them?
49096,Lisa,these badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at sundance.
49944,Lisa,"thanks for not letting me give up, dad."
44864,Lisa,"okay, the museum's got to be north of here. now which way is north...?"
52499,Lisa,that is so typical of you.
44032,Lisa,"isn't it nice up here? what are you thinking, nelson?"
47467,Lisa,how 'bout these entrées? stuffed cabbage? can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse?
42618,Lisa,what!?
52390,Lisa,"i don't deserve it, grampa. no one here does. the people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. they're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony."
44712,Lisa,"well, ralph seems happy enough... maybe i should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor..."
45034,Lisa,"one, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards."
49703,Lisa,"""off with their heads!"" said the red queen. now, pull the tab."
44551,Lisa,yay!/ way to go!
50135,Lisa,i love your pallor.
51168,Lisa,pill attack!
42493,Lisa,dad?
41833,Lisa,"yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. come on, bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
50217,Lisa,"looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, bart."
44549,Lisa,"when i had to learn about the magna carta, i made up a song. ""in 1215 at runnymede!/ doo dah, doo dah/ the nobles and the king agreed!/ oh, d-doo dah day..."""
46439,Lisa,mr. smithers' father!
50256,Lisa,"merry christmas, mom!"
45360,Lisa,bart simpson!
50365,Lisa,you are? why?
45259,Lisa,you gave away my room!
45127,Lisa,i cheated!
44660,Lisa,stop! you are in violation of the model u.n. charter!
47004,Lisa,"dad, this is my moment in the sun. how can you miss it to be with a sandwich?"
47271,Lisa,"i see. principal skinner, may i make an announcement to the school?"
50498,Lisa,all strapped in?
46484,Lisa,"oh, sorry."
45011,Lisa,"dad, women won't like being shot in the face."
46424,Lisa,i suggest dinner and a show.
51718,Lisa,"mom, where's dad?"
45111,Lisa,bart?! shouldn't you be in class?
44540,Lisa,"will you leave me alone? it's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""judgment day""."
49484,Lisa,"oh, fine, fine, finish your song. i can be patient -- after all, i am the gem child."
49988,Lisa,i can see that down deep is a decent man.
42483,Lisa,"wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons."
51105,Lisa,this kilt says you framed my brother! why?
48218,Lisa,so... what setting is that fan on?
49502,Lisa,fifty-fifty?
44584,Lisa,"you like musicals, don't you dad?"
49170,Lisa,"dad, is this from a meth lab?"
45761,Lisa,appointed a supreme court justice.
43079,Lisa,"mom! dad! look, this biography of peter uebberoth is only ninety-nine cents! and i found the new al gore book!"
44761,Lisa,"i think you're a hero, dad."
44046,Lisa,"there, you did it again!"
46467,Lisa,"mr. gere, i was hoping buddhism could bring me inner peace. or is that just a pipe dream?"
43807,Lisa,no! old people deserve our respect! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn. you wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
42015,Lisa,give me some chips for it.
49317,Lisa,apparently not feisty enough. future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. i am not just asking you to save the bees. i am asking you to save your souls.
47177,Lisa,"you know what mom really loves? julienne potatoes. and for dessert, peach crumble."
43771,Lisa,"who do you love most: me, bart, or maggie?"
48724,Lisa,maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
50533,Lisa,food dad! food dad! food dad!
48812,Lisa,the dance isn't till next week.
43724,Lisa,"don't worry, dad. mr. smithers is a resilient man. i'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants."
48629,Lisa,"bart, that's a blowhole!"
51613,Lisa,"with his mom gone, homer needed a hero. and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls."
43681,Lisa,but it's all true!
50674,Lisa,somehow i missed that phase.
48193,Lisa,"yeah, but he's a wanted killer in our community!"
44769,Lisa,me?
43402,Lisa,tito puente?
48035,Lisa,"bart, a school-sponsored medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. you deserve to be expelled."
42796,Lisa,now you're the good cop.
42205,Lisa,no.
47046,Lisa,we've gotta do something to help him.
50080,Lisa,"um, i'm treasurer of the jazz club, and started the school's recycling society."
44460,Lisa,dad! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. it has no meaning today.
48209,Lisa,he's at the door!
47024,Lisa,you mean you're all still proud of me?
50307,Lisa,dad! i know what you did!
49084,Lisa,this is so generous. how can i ever repay you?
46715,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
47288,Lisa,"bart, that exhibit over there is biased, insensitive and anti-feminist."
47722,Lisa,"thank you, nelson."
44198,Lisa,even babies know how to open and close their mouths. you need a bib.
50091,Lisa,"look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, i'm your only shot."
44055,Lisa,"hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind..."
43693,Lisa,he wouldn't let me put it up.
51540,Lisa,don't put more in there!
45975,Lisa,"no, you can't!"
42746,Lisa,"yeah, dad. how many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
52006,Lisa,it's so awful.
46464,Lisa,you guys are buddhists?
41693,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom! hey, mr. bergstrom!"
48699,Lisa,you can't give me a yellow card?! you're my father!
43738,Lisa,okay.
44313,Lisa,"ach! you haven't changed at all! you're still evil! and when you're trying to be good, you're even more evil!"
44613,Lisa,well... if we did set fire to the house...
43093,Lisa,"see, dad. i told you mom would have problems."
47935,Lisa,"also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of--"
50553,Lisa,you're group-writing a book?! but the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
46609,Lisa,victory.
52143,Lisa,there were monsters on that ship. and truly we were them.
43187,Lisa,whatcha doin' ma?
48785,Lisa,kent brockman said a horrible swear!
46716,Lisa,life sucks.
43605,Lisa,"hey, i thought krusty was jewish..."
44140,Lisa,"no, it's not your fault, dad. you did fine. it's just that poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. you can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
50726,Lisa,...you promised to help me write a haiku...
46949,Lisa,i'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
50948,Lisa,i can finally compost!
43696,Lisa,i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
42557,Lisa,no.
52400,Lisa,"forgive us, dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."
43295,Lisa,nooo!!
49840,Lisa,racists?
50979,Lisa,this is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
47423,Lisa,"pictographs! bart, this is a native american burial mound."
44789,Lisa,that's kids news. good night.
46672,Lisa,a lot of people think our dad's behavior has screwed us up. and it has!
45727,Lisa,"mom, dad's on pbs!"
47164,Lisa,look! there's duffman!
43380,Lisa,"it is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, bart. and even if the three stooges were alive, i doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
50955,Lisa,"dad, i just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
50604,Lisa,um... who says we're gonna have kids of our own?
50762,Lisa,do you actually serve those items?
48459,Lisa,here's the only thing i've been on the cover of.
42433,Lisa,oh no. i'll be socially unpopular. more so.
46890,Lisa,precisely.
41675,Lisa,you'd better hope they say yes!
48321,Lisa,"calm down, dad. what happened?"
50576,Lisa,so i pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
45170,Lisa,kids?
47356,Lisa,bart! on't-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.
50233,Lisa,so you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
43038,Lisa,"wow bart, i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion."
46210,Lisa,of course! the nose clip!
47569,Lisa,busted!
48731,Lisa,that's just someone barbecuing.
48674,Lisa,i picked my malibu stacy hybrid convertible. it runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
51889,Lisa,hey!
48378,Lisa,what have i become?
47280,Lisa,don't cry for me kids of springfield / you can still reach me through e-mail / at smart girl six three / underscore back slash / at yahoo dot com / at yahoo dot com...
51673,Lisa,assemblywoman lombard! you got my emails!
51993,Lisa,the simpsons have entered the forest.
49674,Lisa,"listen, not that i've lost my skepticism, but i am interested in learning more about wiccans. are you a minority group as defined by ivy league admissions?"
41930,Lisa,yes.
50786,Lisa,fifth-graders? ooh-la-la! they get to put their desks in a circle!
52362,Lisa,ew.
50619,Lisa,but he's out of his mind -- he can't run for president!
47824,Lisa,"so you see principal skinner, that's why i had to come to you."
44819,Lisa,"it's full, dad. that means you have to take out the trash."
48867,Lisa,"mom, every workout appointment is booked up for months! we'll have to open a second shapes. we just need to find a vacant rental property. hmm..."
43174,Lisa,i'm impressed that you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
48774,Lisa,"oh, that's convenient."
52276,Lisa,"please, dad."
46390,Lisa,what are you doing?
41876,Lisa,"there, there, rabbi. it's not too late."
45503,Lisa,"uh, dad?"
51015,Lisa,dad?!
50413,Lisa,cool! / awesome!
44094,Lisa,mr. smithers! mr. smithers! that moose is on fire!
45495,Lisa,"dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?"
43397,Lisa,nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. and i've got an inquisitive temperament! maybe i could help solve this!
41704,Lisa,he's gone. forever.
46021,Lisa,"no, mom. it's a memorial forest now. if i'm alive, they'll cut it down!"
49925,Lisa,"girl, you're going home! you're going home!"
46604,Lisa,no dad. it's an epic tale from ancient greece.
52134,Lisa,"look, i know that to you we simpsons are a lower order of life. we face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. we throw ourselves on your mercy. please return us to..."
51180,Lisa,"aww, dad, i just got a little twinge in my heart."
43158,Lisa,"yes, bart. why don't you try it and see?"
47316,Lisa,endorsed by the american carny association.
46998,Lisa,r-e-l-a-p-s-e.
47127,Lisa,"well, i like it here, too. luke has shown me the gentle side of the old west. he's really sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old."
48192,Lisa,"see? s'fine. go on, go on with the thing."
49677,Lisa,"well, it is an honor to be asked. but i never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
49699,Lisa,"and now, making his debut on the catwalk... bartholomew!"
41650,Lisa,"oh, yuck! that sandwich is full of meat. there's bacon, canadian bacon, mexican bacon..."
49240,Lisa,"no, none."
43358,Lisa,"that was for you, bleeding gums."
52190,Lisa,become like an uncarved stone.
46279,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
52186,Lisa,"and, finally, the most important book of all, the tao te ching by lao tzu."
44464,Lisa,"no offense, mom, but that was pretty cool."
49148,Lisa,"oh, well, it's one thing to fill in for a monkey. but a comedy legend? i wouldn't dream of it."
51527,Lisa,"oh, dad, you don't want details. no one wants to see the sausage being made."
52437,Lisa,"oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
48715,Lisa,"bart, meet joe laboot."
43349,Lisa,"hi, i have a request. i would like you to do a tribute to bleeding gums murphy, please."
46626,Lisa,"what happened, dad? they didn't really burn her, did they?"
45726,Lisa,"hey, isn't that the bass player from ""satanica""?"
45870,Lisa,i can't help it! it's the shoes!
49857,Lisa,"dad, a meter is three inches longer than a yard, which is thirty-six inches, so fifty divided by thirty-nine times thirty-six, equals--"
42874,Lisa,why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
43901,Lisa,"okay, you found out i'm an over-achieving bookworm. so whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a polaroid. i'm going to sleep."
43881,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever."
50606,Lisa,i need my books!
51204,Lisa,exactly!
47982,Lisa,"that's cameron. girls go crazy over him. he's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
41775,Lisa,i don't think real checks have exclamation points.
42110,Lisa,poor santa's little helper. i'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
49320,Lisa,"i know it's not your fault, muk mu. you're a gentle, loving soul."
49916,Lisa,"hey, mom... dad... there's a whale on the beach... you've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!"
42931,Lisa,aw.
43854,Lisa,"i don't get it. straight a's, perfect attendance, bathroom timer... i should be the most popular girl in school."
47193,Lisa,and yet i'm still not satisfied.
48771,Lisa,but you and willie will drown!
47103,Lisa,"dad, where are you going?"
51207,Lisa,"i haven't heard anything about you, except from you."
47108,Lisa,"mom, i know dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt. why don't you just say you're sorry?"
41758,Lisa,"bart... bart... hey, bart."
46339,Lisa,"well, i've been cutting the felt kinda crooked."
52198,Lisa,the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. all you have to do is hit the ball here.
47767,Lisa,there was a piece of glass / miss lucy sat upon it / and it cut her big fat...
51685,Lisa,"what stopped you, bender? asimov's three laws of robotics?"
44179,Lisa,"but i'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
46104,Lisa,"dad, how could you? we were connecting in such a meaningful way."
49489,Lisa,maggie -- it's true! you are the gem child!
49647,Lisa,cows eating cows?! that's an abomination!
44342,Lisa,can i go downstairs and see what dad's doing?
45244,Lisa,no! the smithsonian traveling exhibit.
44479,Lisa,"dad, that was really mean."
42027,Lisa,"however, i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose. in which case, i'd bet the farm on buffalo."
42051,Lisa,mmm! could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
46233,Lisa,a gift certificate from j.c. penney?
52397,Lisa,it is back.
41738,Lisa,"yeah, mom! guess what? for a dollar a man sold me thirty-five caspers and a dozen lois lanes."
45594,Lisa,"i admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of malibu stacy."
49526,Lisa,"oh ralph, how i envy your optimism. there is no springfield fifty years in the future! with global warming trapping the co2 inside our poisonous atmosphere, our super-heated oceans will rise, drowning our lowlands, leaving what's left of humanity baking in deserts that once fed the world!"
51690,Lisa,what a surprise -- it's bart.
46256,Lisa,the left! go to the left!
52037,Lisa,"yeah. eat it, bart."
42241,Lisa,from now i will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
42233,Lisa,left a good job in the city -- workin' for the man every night and day...
47405,Lisa,why can't your heir be female? or-or why can't we elect our leaders?
48179,Lisa,"well, some people in europe have the impression that america has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. so for the next week, i'm from canada."
50717,Lisa,what is going on?
52497,Lisa,"yes, well, uh..."
42774,Lisa,"dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
51416,Lisa,dad! bart's on my side of the seat!
49352,Lisa,"we're still cool though, right?"
51011,Lisa,what?!
49989,Lisa,"as an eight-year-old girl in twenty-first century america, i know how it is to feel insecure about your looks. but you've got so much going for you. i'd kill for your sense of smell... you have a nice firm handshake..."
49135,Lisa,"hey krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. why don't you hire them both? it won't cost you anything -- you could call bart an intern."
41904,Lisa,it's not my fault. it's the reed.
46139,Lisa,venus simpson? you're replacing me?
48060,Lisa,stop scaring me!
50919,Lisa,"mm, that is good grub."
45190,Lisa,i warned you guys that seniors always vote in record numbers.
51647,Lisa,one florence nightingale in a box and make it snappy!
47868,Lisa,i'm relinquishing the poke-pole.
43984,Lisa,it's no time for school.
52093,Lisa,botz.
45218,Lisa,"ohhh, it sounds so real!"
50783,Lisa,yep. message boards are never wrong.
51523,Lisa,"...and when my dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew i was diving."
49203,Lisa,"we won, he's asleep!"
45699,Lisa,take your arm off me.
41882,Lisa,peace on earth.
52468,Lisa,shopping: it's the most fun you can have standing up.
42498,Lisa,let me see that.
46740,Lisa,poor bart...
47558,Lisa,i'm an orphan!
51334,Lisa,"bart, i need you to help me win the election."
49360,Lisa,see who?
49347,Lisa,"now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- i mean, queendom."
46743,Lisa,"oh, i wish i had someplace to call my own. no one wants me around any more."
42704,Lisa,"come on, stacy. i've waited my whole life to hear you speak. don't you have anything relevant to say?"
51854,Lisa,"yeah, mom, hurry up."
49997,Lisa,"ew, no thanks."
46113,Lisa,that scary guy?
49927,Lisa,bye! goodbye!
42791,Lisa,"wow, i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
42708,Lisa,they cannot keep making dolls like this! something has to be done!
42044,Lisa,bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. find anything good?
52374,Lisa,yea!
51989,Lisa,"you win, bart."
51804,Lisa,that works.
47315,Lisa,"aunts patty and selma, can you help us pick out a mother's day gift?"
46953,Lisa,"dad, this ticket is for tomorrow's wnfl game!"
47944,Lisa,"""hydrogenated petroleum oil, monosodium poisonate, partially de-weaponized plutonium?!"""
50552,Lisa,and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! it's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
41909,Lisa,"i love you, dad!"
43688,Lisa,but it explains why there's no record of jebediah before 1795! he was hans sprüngfeld until then!
50246,Lisa,it's a sign. mom's okay! thank you.
49859,Lisa,"come on, alarm clock -- get me out of this!"
47386,Lisa,"mom, can we go into this bookstore? please, please, please, please, please, please, please?"
49830,Lisa,what are you talking about?
51059,Lisa,i remind you of you?
47779,Lisa,great! will you play malibu stacy with me?
45950,Lisa,how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
47990,Lisa,no one asked you to yell and slash!
46575,Lisa,"dad, it's a documentary on the homeless."
41966,Lisa,awww.
50028,Lisa,emily dickinson.
45718,Lisa,that doesn't sound like bees.
45194,Lisa,"um, dad..."
44705,Lisa,"wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
46153,Lisa,they're recruiting people with subliminal messages!
45597,Lisa,"exactly. come on, bart, we've got to warn everyone."
51898,Lisa,why can't we have a meeting when you're watching tv?
50927,Lisa,um... i just assumed?
49353,Lisa,my best friend is so cool!
46938,Lisa,"don't try to pin this on me, sister."
45803,Lisa,"well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old photo."
46566,Lisa,and where were you?
49491,Lisa,"mom, wait! maggie is the gem child! she's brought peace to our town! and reports of less road rage in shelbyville! she has to stay here!"
52234,Lisa,"bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?"
45717,Lisa,"ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to springfield."
51267,Lisa,i know the answer. i'm gonna force you to turn yourself in.
46762,Lisa,"oh yeah, that's the pride."
43822,Lisa,"all right! now you've got all the simpsons behind you, apu!"
46813,Lisa,get out!
52145,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. you won't learn anything."
50155,Lisa,"dad, can i talk to you for a second?"
45985,Lisa,my name's lisa simpson. i think your protest was incredibly brave.
51349,Lisa,what about obama? harry truman? bill clinton?
44222,Lisa,"ew, your arm! it's got extra corners!"
43766,Lisa,woo hoo!
49152,Lisa,i'm gonna keep this forever!
43818,Lisa,"i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad."
49131,Lisa,what? bart got a swiss army knife.
47360,Lisa,"ms. naegle, even though i disagree with your principles, i certainly admire your success."
50148,Lisa,"wow, mom -- you got first place in the science fair!"
50582,Lisa,see?
50817,Lisa,a mockingbird without a song...
52470,Lisa,"hi zia, how did you do on your math test?"
50930,Lisa,"oh, thank god! just a dream!"
43014,Lisa,"don't be so hard on yourself, bart. it's not your fault jessica doesn't like you."
43658,Lisa,"""rory b. bellows, slip eight!"" let's go!"
47542,Lisa,you're a great mom. you were always there for bart with love and support. his acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
49790,Lisa,"there must have been some good ancestors -- grampa, don't you know any?"
46564,Lisa,"well, if you don't feel the way greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt."
46551,Lisa,but west springfield's three times the size of texas. we'll never find him there.
48553,Lisa,"c'mon dad, read the last chapter! everyone says there's a big surprise -- i bet angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
46972,Lisa,do you even know what a loft is?
41999,Lisa,"well, i like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- seattle because they got something to prove -- and the raiders because they always cheat."
48103,Lisa,"bart, i think you're behind this whole thing."
47099,Lisa,does anyone have any swan heads? i've got nothing but necks.
48955,Lisa,that's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
51418,Lisa,"hi, ralph... um, i just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
47716,Lisa,i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
48695,Lisa,"sadly, no. i'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but i'm not surprised."
50769,Lisa,it'll be fine. just learn your lines.
46957,Lisa,"there are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. the bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. and with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
49081,Lisa,"well, according to aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"
45812,Lisa,hey! no fair! we'll never get a good picture.
50274,Lisa,you could deliver newspapers.
50115,Lisa,he's not! he thought he was better than the laws of probability. anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
50943,Lisa,"dad, pay attention to your children!"
44297,Lisa,no.
48736,Lisa,"dad, we're in the maze."
45881,Lisa,"oh, mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
44536,Lisa,"ugh, i wish i'd never found those stupid bones! it's time to put an end to this. bart, i'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
48213,Lisa,"boy, you sure showed them."
49482,Lisa,it all adds up. i am the gem that will bring world peace! how brilliant of god to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
50914,Lisa,all day i have vitamin burps.
50906,Lisa,what are you talking about?
51245,Lisa,"help me, doctor!"
52395,Lisa,will you take us to mt. splashmore?
44949,Lisa,"so, there i am being nice to alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me."
51202,Lisa,he's targeting the nuclear plant?!
49960,Lisa,sally circle was eating donuts and ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news.
44453,Lisa,"dad, that's our house."
50412,Lisa,why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
51698,Lisa,we're sorry.
45361,Lisa,"bart, are you crazy? you've got to get the old folks home to the old folks home."
45215,Lisa,"what's this wrapped in a banana leaf? mmm, smells like mint."
51290,Lisa,two can be as bad as one / it's the loneliest number since the number one...
50076,Lisa,sorry!
48120,Lisa,bart?
51299,Lisa,how do you know my name?
50583,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story."
50739,Lisa,"i sold a couple of my rare jazz records. after a while they all start to sound the same. still love the genre, of course. not even close to getting sick of it."
46707,Lisa,you think i'll pass gym this term?
47720,Lisa,"okay, if i stop here, i still have some dignity."
43936,Lisa,"oh, my poor little guys. that bart is so rude."
51088,Lisa,objection! prejudicial!
50108,Lisa,don't swing.
51773,Lisa,whoa! looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak.
42908,Lisa,"why, here's allison's real diorama. it got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
44469,Lisa,yayyy!
44361,Lisa,"i am just calling home, i am not asking to come home."
43509,Lisa,"while i was gone, i got some really good advice from paul and linda mccartney."
48334,Lisa,we haven't gotten our food yet!
44713,Lisa,"yeah... huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!"
50535,Lisa,i can't believe dad is missing this!
47537,Lisa,uh-oh.
45838,Lisa,run!
49333,Lisa,"yes, i would. class, everyone please stop and admire juliet's painting..."
47380,Lisa,i guess i'm not meant to own a cat. i'm much happier petting this leaf.
43353,Lisa,where am i gonna get five hundred dollars?
51839,Lisa,"can we go too, dad?"
49269,Lisa,"dad, i know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the new york times crossword puzzle?"
46330,Lisa,so many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
50898,Lisa,"i've read every expert on poker, and watched jennifer tilly's dvd."
52120,Lisa,ow! mom! bart threw a book at me.
41823,Lisa,sour grapes.
49407,Lisa,"i don't know, but he's algaefying."
43381,Lisa,"oh, no. that's awful, mr. puente. what? oh. he owns the nuclear power plant. yeah, i'd like to settle his hash, too."
51608,Lisa,fine.
47370,Lisa,that book doesn't know how i feel.
43154,Lisa,"if there has to be a bastardized version of krusty, i'm glad it's you."
50297,Lisa,"""while beautiful, the desert also harbors hidden dangers: cacti, poisonous snakes, and most deadly of all--"
50740,Lisa,"and dad donated something, too."
47303,Lisa,we found a secret tunnel out of the tower. it was used by sir walter raleigh!
43723,Lisa,are you sure he's dead? maybe you just really really hurt him.
41789,Lisa,okay.
42320,Lisa,eh.
46657,Lisa,you know i'm a vegetarian.
49553,Lisa,confirm.
49897,Lisa,"ants have six legs, bart."
47494,Lisa,"maggie, push the red button!"
42775,Lisa,dad! you're sinking!
47960,Lisa,"thanks, bart. that's really sweet."
43680,Lisa,"aw, thanks, dad."
48751,Lisa,"good work, database."
42996,Lisa,ringo to his rest of the beatles!
49405,Lisa,can you keep her quiet?
48196,Lisa,sideshow bob!
42181,Lisa,kowalski!
43323,Lisa,your sax! thank you so much!
46723,Lisa,i'll see you tomorrow!
44531,Lisa,it's not that i don't have a spiritual side. i just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.
48928,Lisa,i did not!
42309,Lisa,bart!
49938,Lisa,"those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. i guess it's just nature's way."
47427,Lisa,"hi, janey... branford marsalis' car broke down outside your house? and he's just jamming 'til wynton shows up? oh..."
42912,Lisa,only if we're the best.
50651,Lisa,sherri? terri? hopscotch? double dutch? ringolivio? anyone?
50393,Lisa,brother germs!
45549,Lisa,"dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
43192,Lisa,wow. how many pulitzer prizes winners can do that?
50868,Lisa,i thought i was the favorite.
47169,Lisa,"uh-oh, dad. i think he peed on the rug."
50908,Lisa,"well, back to square one is a major victory in this house, but why did you help me?"
45652,Lisa,will you guys turn that thing down?
50291,Lisa,"you know, your movie's not all bad. if you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film."
49623,Lisa,i don't want to talk about it.
44611,Lisa,ugh! one of them's playing my saxophone!
51940,Lisa,"but, mr. largo, that's what my country's all about."
43549,Lisa,umm... mom just baked a cake.
52410,Lisa,i was just practicing.
47266,Lisa,"well, i don't feel like it now."
43267,Lisa,"if it wasn't you, then who was it?"
48528,Lisa,moe marginalized my contributions...
47973,Lisa,did i forget to mention yoooouuu?
46741,Lisa,"i know just how you feel -- isolated, alone, cut off from everyone--"
50330,Lisa,"i never thought i'd say this, but dad is the only one who can help us."
50164,Lisa,it's plenty good! it's great! it's just... not for me.
46086,Lisa,"no, bart. for all we know, hundreds of rescue workers are digging us out right now."
45445,Lisa,me too. let's go to an authentic japanese noodle house!
46368,Lisa,alakazai dragon fly!
45992,Lisa,"mom, dad, there's something i have to do. you're not gonna like it, but i really believe it's the right thing."

41896,Lisa,"hey, here's a good job, dad. oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor."
43518,Lisa,it worked! they're all dead!
49565,Lisa,i'm lisa. one word.
45240,Lisa,dad! don't you remember? it's our special saturday.
47340,Lisa,"well, dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
45243,Lisa,"oh, this is perfect!"
51719,Lisa,"well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-saharan african music, but the rest will have to wait. bart, bart, i hear mom sobbing and i don't know where dad is!"
50037,Lisa,"it's called ""applause."""
49378,Lisa,isn't that a little clichéd?
46055,Lisa,mom wants you to come to bed.
48833,Lisa,"whatever we did, we're sorry."
48141,Lisa,i guess.
42880,Lisa,i won first chair?
52153,Lisa,"not yet, sir."
48588,Lisa,"chill thunder! ""chill thunder""!"
45666,Lisa,"lazy, no-good lepers... making me clean everything myself..."
49093,Lisa,"dad, no!"
47263,Lisa,"well, i think i can say with all humility, i am gonna be the best school president ever."
46243,Lisa,isn't that cute? a bush-baby.
49215,Lisa,i guess.
44100,Lisa,"uh, mom?"
45152,Lisa,dad!
45241,Lisa,"why do you assume that i won't pick something fun? let's see... oh, this looks very educatio--"
47504,Lisa,"mr. leonard, how'd you get in a movie?"
43639,Lisa,how much did it cost?
51801,Lisa,i think we might just make a good team. like maggie and grampa.
44734,Lisa,"...but i have something more important to say. for reasons beyond my control, i will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. so before that happens, i want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me..."
49239,Lisa,cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
50623,Lisa,"i knew you were, dad. i always knew."
47290,Lisa,"bart, i don't care what mom said. i think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
51788,Lisa,i just wanted to see if there was a better life. even for a little bit.
50658,Lisa,polo!
52136,Lisa,there's something not quite right about this.
42817,Lisa,oooh.
41978,Lisa,i think so.
46409,Lisa,i love chinatown... although i wish they'd stop picking on tibet town.
47651,Lisa,i can't. my mom's not picking me up for an hour.
42578,Lisa,and...?
47426,Lisa,"""the mound builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."""
44193,Lisa,"you should wash up for dinner. to make it fun, you can use the mr. bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
47893,Lisa,yay!
50305,Lisa,that's him!
46538,Lisa,aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
44989,Lisa,enjoy the dance.
43992,Lisa,you're very lucky to have mom.
45253,Lisa,"it guarantees all of the basic freedoms -- speech, religion, the right to a speedy trial..."
47658,Lisa,what the...?
52394,Lisa,of course.
42881,Lisa,"i need help, mom. there's another girl at school who's smarter, younger, and a better sax player than me. oh i feel so average."
42223,Lisa,are we done?
50411,Lisa,"bart, i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser."
45026,Lisa,but mom said not to!
48637,Lisa,no you haven't!
51607,Lisa,mom! i'm narrating!
48660,Lisa,pong!
48858,Lisa,"god, that was lame! where did you get that?!"
46169,Lisa,ow! ow!
45219,Lisa,"dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the sunday paper."
44939,Lisa,"she's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
41807,Lisa,honest abe. he'll show me the way.
49414,Lisa,how did i do?
44842,Lisa,dad?
42984,Lisa,no edgar neubauer.
50974,Lisa,you didn't?! is there no limit to your disrespect?
45416,Lisa,"oh, well, we really mean it."
43164,Lisa,hey! i need that!
48461,Lisa,"aww, they're all so cute."
51624,Lisa,"dad, you're eating too much! i'm worried about your health! i don't wanna lose you!"
49835,Lisa,"you were right, dad. i should have quit while i was ahead, instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and virgil."
44123,Lisa,"we'll miss you, shary bobbins."
50885,Lisa,where'd you get that shirt?
46299,Lisa,"oh my god, it's 11:15!"
46418,Lisa,"well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
47782,Lisa,it's my entry for the all-school science fair.
46446,Lisa,that could not be more blasphemous.
44745,Lisa,dearest log: i am me again! and i feel like there's nothing i can't do...except this stupid brain teas...
48938,Lisa,you wrote a report on it last week!
42803,Lisa,only because mayor quimby's buying his nephew's freedom.
42569,Lisa,i'd like to believe that this time. i really would.
43008,Lisa,"bart, does it strike you as odd that uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called uterbräten?"
45888,Lisa,isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?
48198,Lisa,"hey, krusty's in an opera, here in rome! he can save our lives! come on, let's go!"
46506,Lisa,just ten more years! / just ten more years! / just ten more years!
46823,Lisa,"believe me, he doesn't. his act is getting old fast."
51870,Lisa,look what i found.
43110,Lisa,"you're a member of the stonecutters, grampa?"
48598,Lisa,"no, no! you've already got your revenge!"
45008,Lisa,okay. umm... automatic...
52372,Lisa,"i've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. but when i look into his vacant brown eyes, i just can't bear to let him go. i'm sure mom agrees with me."
50496,Lisa,"""perhaps someday there will be a cure. although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy, i'll pass."""
49311,Lisa,"oh, i miss them."
47905,Lisa,runaway truck lane! we're saved!
44167,Lisa,but everyone will know you did this!
43912,Lisa,hurry up! mom and dad'll be home soon!
50009,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
48100,Lisa,"dad, i thought mom kicked you out of the house."
48275,Lisa,"so, to contin-"
44896,Lisa,ohmigosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis.
45299,Lisa,"not to me, dad."
51779,Lisa,"that's so sad. maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to..."
50643,Lisa,i never said it was diabolical!
50072,Lisa,"this is really fun. but we're still just friends, right?"
44575,Lisa,"um, miss hoover! miss hoover!"
47963,Lisa,"and if i win, i'll be on itchy and scratchy..."
41822,Lisa,"it's the german term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
48259,Lisa,this chamber's not on the map! we could be stuck in here forever if we don't find a way out!
43774,Lisa,da-ad!
52165,Lisa,we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher!
46459,Lisa,yep.
48567,Lisa,"it's your foot doctor, gil! yes... yes... oh dear... i can't tell him that."
42838,Lisa,canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwe... etc.
43995,Lisa,it does not!
44643,Lisa,who wants rations?
49899,Lisa,/ what's going on?
48658,Lisa,pong!
48420,Lisa,"i want you to know, i respect your beliefs and i can see how deeply you feel about them."
51212,Lisa,what other side?
42755,Lisa,me too.
50720,Lisa,"everything has rules, bart."
49689,Lisa,that river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
46535,Lisa,you wanna know what happened?
50574,Lisa,"no need to thank me, boys."
45913,Lisa,"to prolong the run of the series, i was secretly given anti-growth hormones."
43824,Lisa,"no, not what he said -- what he is. grandfather. as in ""grandfather clause"". apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
47562,Lisa,so... how's the weather in dayton?
52484,Lisa,bingo.
42328,Lisa,"oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
49082,Lisa,"okay, but can i just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
47649,Lisa,"she's very pretty, but the answer is still no."
47684,Lisa,"""...but screw them, you're in! congratulations!"""
42657,Lisa,"bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. that saxophone was my one creative outlet. it was the only way i could truly express myself."
50327,Lisa,"you mean, just reality."
46012,Lisa,"hey, everybody! i..."
48491,Lisa,"hmm, well i think your golem doesn't like hurting people. and i'll prove it."
48482,Lisa,"wow mom, you made all this?"
48922,Lisa,it seemed like twenty.
45875,Lisa,you mean i danced all by myself?
46184,Lisa,"well, someone's gotta make her feel welcome."
50639,Lisa,all right already! i had no friends.
46779,Lisa,hip hip...
50493,Lisa,"""d, e, a..."""
46991,Lisa,a-m-e-l-i-o-r-a-t-e. ameliorate.
45109,Lisa,"well, actually, i do feel a little feverish."
41817,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i couldn't think of a nice way to say america stinks."
46083,Lisa,"look, the sea captain's all hunkered down."
46290,Lisa,huh? this isn't miss hoover's class.
47318,Lisa,"i don't care if they think you're a coward, dad. you did the right thing, hiding and crying."
44316,Lisa,"oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! i was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
43335,Lisa,yeah.
47612,Lisa,"dad, he's deaf."
45279,Lisa,sounds great.
43055,Lisa,bart started it.
48235,Lisa,"i think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. goodnight, willie."
51414,Lisa,how does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
51154,Lisa,i was.
49982,Lisa,i know where bob's taking bart!
46313,Lisa,"...as the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery."
46239,Lisa,"""find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to africa."""
50490,Lisa,"okay, first letter ""d."" next letter: a-b-c-d-e-"
43415,Lisa,"so, the d.n.a. was right. it must've been... oh, dad!"
42781,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet."
43495,Lisa,that's cute.
48267,Lisa,mad beast!
51798,Lisa,"yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was michael jackson."
50083,Lisa,thrust! parry! dodge! poke!
51443,Lisa,"you. he's tried to kill you. me, i think he likes."
51883,Lisa,tough choice.
47798,Lisa,what countries are those?
46159,Lisa,"a wig! but, but your pant legs..."
44573,Lisa,and after we spent all the townspeople's money.
50657,Lisa,you really want me?
52285,Lisa,shut your mouth!
52011,Lisa,i hope she likes the presents we got her.
52297,Lisa,"so, it was love at first sight."
44120,Lisa,but we're not sleepy.
46988,Lisa,it was so exciting -- i actually got applause for being smart!
49959,Lisa,i ha--
47555,Lisa,"it's called wicca, and it's empowering!"
43370,Lisa,"mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad."
43728,Lisa,we've got to get seats for the itchy and scratchy parade.
50745,Lisa,two diplomats' sons are in love with me. who will i choose: ghana or portugal?
51326,Lisa,ew. how long has it been since you washed your stomach?
45033,Lisa,"dad, they aren't birds."
46497,Lisa,"hey, where'd they go?"
48979,Lisa,get off me!
51302,Lisa,and don't you hate being the middle child?
44494,Lisa,"dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant."
42177,Lisa,but i am far more pessimistic.
48603,Lisa,"the point, dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm."
42401,Lisa,"ralph, i'm sorry i..."
47250,Lisa,"oh, don't be silly."
41827,Lisa,but bart --
49736,Lisa,what will that do?
44317,Lisa,"i don't want to talk to you, mr. burns."
46820,Lisa,he started it! he did punch buggy first!
49266,Lisa,"""last clue: ""loses on purpose"". hmmm... ""diets!"" oh, will shortz, you clever rascal."
51791,Lisa,"hm. for a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel."
47687,Lisa,you feed us on twelve dollars a week?
51826,Lisa,what percentage of prayers really come true?
52444,Lisa,oh lord.
46517,Lisa,"i'm so sorry, grampa."
51294,Lisa,"well, at least i'm getting some attention."
52380,Lisa,yes!
42985,Lisa,this is hopeless. they're gonna demolish our house for sure. we're gonna have to move into a motel 6.
44122,Lisa,"more kippers, mum?"
49272,Lisa,"well i must admit, i'm kind of touched. ""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" nice."
41751,Lisa,"yes, dad."
45073,Lisa,"don't blame us, dad. the celebrities are the ones who canned you."
44196,Lisa,"uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
51774,Lisa,a bald eagle!
42095,Lisa,she wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition.
45426,Lisa,"dad, it's not..."
50588,Lisa,"well, i could help you..."
43082,Lisa,what do you think mom and dad are doing right now?
48548,Lisa,no.
44586,Lisa,oooooo.
42632,Lisa,are you hiding something from me?
41683,Lisa,ah.
49587,Lisa,"because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then i feel sorry for you. do you feel sorry for me? guess not."
49177,Lisa,tracking software? you're spying on bart!
48471,Lisa,"shut up! i just said ""shut up."" i'll punish myself by going upstairs."
47195,Lisa,"dad, do you realize what you've done? you've created a world without death."
44762,Lisa,dad!
52387,Lisa,"yeah, bart, get out and push."
42465,Lisa,that's as bad as the tasteless itchy and sambo cartoons of the late 30s. the writers should be ashamed of themselves.
46164,Lisa,"an aircraft carrier? oh, that's subtle."
46771,Lisa,"""william h. bonney."" ""gunned down july 14, 1881. aged twenty-one."" so young."
43612,Lisa,"mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy!"
47273,Lisa,"principal skinner, i will not call off this strike until you bring back music and art."
47856,Lisa,yes. the clerk also gave me this bench warrant for dad's arrest.
50310,Lisa,but it's not real happiness. it's just because of an untested drug!
44392,Lisa,i just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
50027,Lisa,it's just... dinner conversation at arts camp was a bit more stimulating. one night we spoke only in lines from famous poems.
49115,Lisa,i wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using styrofoam!
42139,Lisa,"hey bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
46981,Lisa,woo hoo!
42337,Lisa,five... six... seven... eight...
43123,Lisa,aw.
45701,Lisa,"""stars and stripes forever""? oh, man. they're toast!"
45235,Lisa,"how'd you know your plan would work, mom?"
47921,Lisa,what is bart still doing in there?
50485,Lisa,"ew, dad! wait a minute... can you pass gas at will? fart once for no, twice for yes."
51436,Lisa,"whoa! mom, you made me over-swipe!"
41609,Lisa,"simone de beauvoir, margaret mead, queen elizabeth the first, lauren bacall..."
48079,Lisa,i can't keep sleeping in mom and dad's room.
49785,Lisa,"it's not that easy, bart. i... traded away my pearls! without them, i'm just a big maggie!"
51249,Lisa,maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.
48317,Lisa,grampa must've set them free!
49002,Lisa,this is so hard!
46615,Lisa,and now... attack!
44714,Lisa,all right! sounds good!
47633,Lisa,but i didn't read my poem!
46783,Lisa,please don't hurt our family.
47040,Lisa,"krusty, i don't usually give advice to republicans, but it would be nice to be on the winning side for once. you have to start making an honest connection with the voters. talk about how you could help regular families -- like ours."
46107,Lisa,"oh, dad."
43455,Lisa,with the change in my piggy bank.
49999,Lisa,"mom, this isn't the way home."
44410,Lisa,"but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!"
45512,Lisa,i don't think so!
51975,Lisa,i feel more popular already.
47200,Lisa,i'll tell professor frink he's won. tack för att ni förärat vår stad.
42753,Lisa,"hi, mom."
46654,Lisa,123 papaya street -- this is ronaldo's orphanage.
42266,Lisa,"it was the greatest movie i've ever seen in my life. and you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. dustin hoffman, michael jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
41624,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
51422,Lisa,what? a rule's a rule.
46383,Lisa,you're not even listening!
50836,Lisa,"yeah, for about a week. but as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de barto. and that's why you're alone tonight."
49418,Lisa,"pride is to ""downfall"" as ""overconfidence"" is to..."
49159,Lisa,"everyone, wait!"
45817,Lisa,"no, you saved our lives."
44715,Lisa,"if she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
43329,Lisa,"hey, bleeding gums! i was great! and i owe it all to..."
51298,Lisa,that's a reference to the brontë sisters!
41932,Lisa,uh... take us to the video store.
45963,Lisa,"ms. tan, i loved ""the joy luck club"". it really showed me how the mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity."
49373,Lisa,"juliet, i'm scared."
48313,Lisa,"dad, that's mac tonight."
51273,Lisa,no you're not!
42676,Lisa,i've got a weekend job helping the poor. and i'm only eight.
51926,Lisa,what do you like best about me?
43532,Lisa,"um, i would also like to take your coat."
43974,Lisa,"da-ad! v-chip, v-chip!"
45119,Lisa,daddd...
51423,Lisa,i saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
47550,Lisa,"good for you, mrs. k!"
51648,Lisa,really bart?
46208,Lisa,"hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
50487,Lisa,"well, it means that you can communicate!"
48773,Lisa,how do i stop it?!
48255,Lisa,i understand.
45903,Lisa,wow...
52296,Lisa,okay. uh... how did dad propose to you?
41717,Lisa,mom! you wouldn't dare.
46469,Lisa,"""nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... no creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
51415,Lisa,not to.
47036,Lisa,"there's the 10:50 from newark... the 10:52 from phoenix, connecting from dallas... the 10:55 from portland is running late. again. there it is."
48264,Lisa,"hello, mr. bighorn sheep!"
48803,Lisa,"dad, all you circled were the ""i's"" and ""a's""."
42786,Lisa,"yeah, me too. that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia."
47368,Lisa,snowball!
41801,Lisa,mom?
46739,Lisa,what are you doing?
46112,Lisa,"so, how was it in the slammer?"
50207,Lisa,"yes, technically it's you. but like i said, people change and--"
43062,Lisa,"ew. bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. they go in the trash."
52112,Lisa,okay.
42570,Lisa,i knew it.
45188,Lisa,"... that's right, homer simpson."
43161,Lisa,"see, the southern hemisphere is made up of everything below the equa... this line."
42579,Lisa,"excuse me, bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
49283,Lisa,sorry.
44309,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, mr. burns! you're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the aspen crowd."
44485,Lisa,just tell them about yourself.
49430,Lisa,"okay, everyone squeeze in."
46048,Lisa,pranksgiving? uh-oh...
43979,Lisa,i'm gonna rescue a baby seal! and then i'm gonna save an otter!
43486,Lisa,"i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to my room."
50494,Lisa,"""dearest marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."""
49245,Lisa,"with my luck, i bet it will. it's practically a sure thing."
48145,Lisa,this election is out of control. someone terrible could win!
50716,Lisa,you're an undercover cop?
42634,Lisa,"dad, i'm not gonna fall for that."
46806,Lisa,it's wednesday night!
44957,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
48990,Lisa,i didn't know you cared about ballet.
46515,Lisa,i'm eight years old.
46315,Lisa,"wow, look at all these flavors: blessed virgin berry... command-mint... biblegum..."
48397,Lisa,this is horrible.
51866,Lisa,"yeah, dad. you can do it!"
44934,Lisa,"well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. the new malibu stacy has an achievable chest."
46700,Lisa,forget it. i'm going home.
50098,Lisa,fine. i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
46457,Lisa,i can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
45595,Lisa,did you see that?
43866,Lisa,exactly.
51346,Lisa,"but what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't."
47038,Lisa,i've been saying it for three weeks! but every time i open my mouth...
46135,Lisa,"dad, i don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt mom."
51582,Lisa,"it's so much fun to finally have a friend who likes the npr show ""wait wait, don't tell me"" as much as i do."
51032,Lisa,"hmm, you're right. it is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted tv shows."
43573,Lisa,"gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to springfield?"
45142,Lisa,"and the tumbleweeds tumble at 2, 4 and 6! plus a midnight tumbling on weekends."
50548,Lisa,can i have my allowance early? i need to buy some carbon-offset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books.
49175,Lisa,what are you two doing in the laundry room?
46062,Lisa,can i turn this off?
52353,Lisa,"if bart stays home, i'm going to school."
47969,Lisa,i've been to paris / and london and tokyo town / but one crazy burg / has 'em all beat hands down...
47438,Lisa,"look, just because milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend."
43677,Lisa,he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. he even tried to kill george washington!
45925,Lisa,we're in the three bears house!
45271,Lisa,i am trying to do my homework.
46350,Lisa,that's not a tall tale. it's a book by mark twain.
43217,Lisa,i'd love to. can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
45808,Lisa,"now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture."
45723,Lisa,"okay, i finished the gardening sequence."
45022,Lisa,yes! a maggie-oop!
42228,Lisa,oh bart.
48413,Lisa,"evolution and creationism cannot co-exist, people. it is time to go back to teaching one single truth!"
51996,Lisa,"remember, dad. the handle of the big dipper points to the north star."
51655,Lisa,no! no! no! no! that's super hell!
47192,Lisa,"well, it looks like maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
48775,Lisa,"yeah, dad."
50521,Lisa,"relax, mom -- be adventurous."
46125,Lisa,especially bonnets.
51097,Lisa,just remember this: a simpson never gives up.
51481,Lisa,"i'm definitely getting this one. oh, but i forgot about this one! oh my god i never even saw this one!"
50993,Lisa,another surfer?
41755,Lisa,"it's to open the crate, stupid."
52301,Lisa,"dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?"
50166,Lisa,ice cold.
48540,Lisa,county fair music?
48653,Lisa,"cletus, i think you're spending too much of the kids' earnings on yourself."
48741,Lisa,maybe there's something in dad's backpack.
43204,Lisa,guess so.
51370,Lisa,thank you.
49666,Lisa,you mean... witches?
49863,Lisa,"uh-oh, looks like i'm in more trouble. born to be bad."
50182,Lisa,count me in!
51005,Lisa,"don't you see, you're taking women for granted. and aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
44826,Lisa,"you know dad, there's a lesson in all this. many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just..."
45904,Lisa,"it was such an honor to be on the walk of fame. i mean, there we were with hollywood royalty, like milton berle and nelson mandela."
51923,Lisa,"i'm not a sniveling toad, am i?"
44023,Lisa,hardly.
44630,Lisa,we are watching fox.
48810,Lisa,and you contributed to our culture!
51878,Lisa,yeah!
49377,Lisa,a battle to determine the fate of equalia. but you wouldn't be interested.
42007,Lisa,"dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. and with your blessing, i'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago."
48982,Lisa,"no, not cool! we have to do the right thing, and come clean! listen, world! we killed martin prince!"
48189,Lisa,"dad, don't act like mussolini!"
46927,Lisa,"dad, we are there."
44811,Lisa,"willie, stop!"
48969,Lisa,bart! no! don't do...
47327,Lisa,"hey! wait a minute, if we're all out here, who's in there?"
43608,Lisa,i think i'm having chest pains.
51250,Lisa,what i'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
45176,Lisa,"fine. we'll play ""hippo in the house."""
48717,Lisa,the person who hates bart more than anyone else. look!
43632,Lisa,"mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'cause i heard--"
45865,Lisa,"ohhhhhh. that's brilliant, professor! what will you think of next?"
48845,Lisa,"i'm concerned we might be heading down a slippery slope. what do you think, nelson?"
47979,Lisa,really? what's wrong?
42184,Lisa,"bart, you said you were gonna name it ""camp freedom."""
51430,Lisa,"we do have them! they're my home screen! miss hoover! once again, the lesson plan i prepared would've covered this topic much better, but i can see..."
42447,Lisa,dad! i was telling the story.
51325,Lisa,"isabel! i want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship..."
44829,Lisa,"but dad, you can't cram garbage under springfield forever."
48834,Lisa,it sounded like you were.
50502,Lisa,no.
48830,Lisa,...and the father-daughter dance.
45242,Lisa,the book fair?
50003,Lisa,hello? hello?
45000,Lisa,"come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt."
47841,Lisa,you make those same stupid jokes every field trip!
48698,Lisa,ow! she tripped me. ow! owww!
44101,Lisa,"um, there's a hair in my soup. but i'll just eat around it."
47372,Lisa,"too fluffy, too siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. me-ow!"
51144,Lisa,mom's deleting old tv shows off the dvr.
45105,Lisa,okay. all right. you can bluff your way through one test.
49116,Lisa,i want a poodle!
46356,Lisa,"no, pierce brosnan. a voice like his would give our house a much-needed touch of class."
45663,Lisa,"okay, and... ""diagnose""."
48180,Lisa,"dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?"
46931,Lisa,how could you?
44151,Lisa,"but, dad, it's barbaric! how does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
43056,Lisa,"you'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
52447,Lisa,can i wear your jewelry?
50427,Lisa,i am so sorry.
49707,Lisa,"two brothers? bart, who is this kid?"
44995,Lisa,what happened?
44331,Lisa,it's a videotape!
49945,Lisa,do you think they'll be okay?
46490,Lisa,"no, i'm still buddhist, but i can worship with my family too."
44966,Lisa,stop saying hello!
42283,Lisa,"bart, are you taking a bath?"
47070,Lisa,"dad, that's a moth."
50565,Lisa,do i have to do any writing?
43212,Lisa,finished this page?
42125,Lisa,"yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
41920,Lisa,no.
46425,Lisa,"dad, what's wrong?"
49621,Lisa,asterisk! asterisk! asterisk!
47826,Lisa,"mr. alcatraaaz, my name is lisa simpson, and this is principal skinner."
47353,Lisa,people would be a lot happier without presents.
46661,Lisa,"mom, my potato is eating a carrot!"
52294,Lisa,how romantic.
48902,Lisa,but won't that just shift the burden to your children?
43408,Lisa,"hey, chief wiggum, what are you doing? what's going on?"
47498,Lisa,i don't remember doing that. i would never cheat!
42093,Lisa,"well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
48824,Lisa,creative responses for infant edu-loving!
44383,Lisa,for satisfactory completion of the second grade.
43548,Lisa,dad?
46186,Lisa,my name's lisa. what's yours?
50937,Lisa,the dog's got the mumps.
43298,Lisa,"i've never seen them fight like that, bart. i'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
50197,Lisa,"you know, it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town."
45157,Lisa,"oh, my god. someone has to go back in for maggie!"
48970,Lisa,...whatever the heck you're doing.
51514,Lisa,"okay, dad's my hero. why is he my hero?"
46477,Lisa,om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung.
46219,Lisa,yes!
50054,Lisa,"hi, nelson."
48263,Lisa,...when suddenly i heard...
44076,Lisa,maybe you just dreamed it.
47485,Lisa,two cents...
46666,Lisa,"dad, you just said that three minutes ago."
47553,Lisa,why are we even going? last year uncle tyrone was bitter and depressed.
48692,Lisa,what happened to the ref?
46542,Lisa,she could get hurt!
49948,Lisa,"well, i am one: flattered and two: intrigued. lisa simpson."
47993,Lisa,"dad, i don't want things to be awful between us. i made you some cookies."
48154,Lisa,"nelson, those don't count as easter eggs!"
42219,Lisa,she's beautiful.
51667,Lisa,it's a terrific sport that--
49370,Lisa,okay... best friend.
51342,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
44445,Lisa,"oh no! and i let him use my toothbrush! well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me."
45138,Lisa,"because after all, education is the search for truth..."
43555,Lisa,"hi, everybody."
49838,Lisa,that's why my jazz is so smooth!
51677,Lisa,what!?!?
48269,Lisa,maybe mr. smithers will help us.
51076,Lisa,that is so unsatisfying.
51329,Lisa,well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
47894,Lisa,"no, i don't see dad doing all that paperwork."
49737,Lisa,"chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!"
49506,Lisa,"pretty much, yeah."
44689,Lisa,"if you're suggesting i stayed up all night trying to solve that childish puzzle, you're right."
46088,Lisa,it sounded like a silo tipping over!
43206,Lisa,that man is instantly the most annoying person i've ever met. a soy-based snack will calm me down.
49015,Lisa,what am i doing? i don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet.
43683,Lisa,"that won't help, dad. no one's ever going to believe me."
45697,Lisa,"well, i thought maybe, for once, we could play a song that wasn't written by sousa."
45828,Lisa,rock and roll.
49649,Lisa,"yes, and-- oh, go ahead."
43211,Lisa,i read at a 78th grade level.
49439,Lisa,"but mom, you'll miss the eclipse."
50566,Lisa,i'm in.
49729,Lisa,gotcha!
52367,Lisa,bad dog! don't worry snowball. you're safe with me.
47026,Lisa,that's amazing. thank you.
51794,Lisa,"let's see... what rhymes with ""jebediah""?"
48663,Lisa,"fort. that's build a ""fort."""
43795,Lisa,"no, it's somebody's gross gum! get it out! ow! ow! it's pulling out my hairs!"
46318,Lisa,that was great. i can't believe she found a rhyme for hezekiah.
50592,Lisa,no bart! you can read other books too!
50426,Lisa,"all right, sister. what's your game?"
43950,Lisa,it says here one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at disneyland.
46226,Lisa,"please, dr. koop. let me demonstrate."
50474,Lisa,you know i hate surprises!
50704,Lisa,dad? dad?
48478,Lisa,"oh, bart, thank you so, so much!"
51963,Lisa,that was beautiful. what's it called?
48974,Lisa,aren't they beautiful?
49951,Lisa,"initially yes, but--"
50587,Lisa,patience! patience! get on with it!
44981,Lisa,"ah. what am i doing? this isn't me. i'm sorry, milhouse."
43182,Lisa,it is off.
41941,Lisa,"mom, instead of milk for dinner, can i have a ""virgin moe?"""
51071,Lisa,my teacher's still bullying me.
44131,Lisa,"sure, we love it! but how can we watch tv when it's so beautiful out?"
48846,Lisa,i fed your fish.
49382,Lisa,"looks like. juliet, i don't want to go to equalia anymore."
42992,Lisa,"you know, sideshow bob, i believe you when you say you're innocent..."
51490,Lisa,where'd he go?
44173,Lisa,"no, chief, bob's innocent! it's the truth!"
47369,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure i'm ready for a new cat."
43124,Lisa,why aren't there any pictures of maggie?
51928,Lisa,"open your mouth, and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise."
44942,Lisa,"that's it, don't be shy..."
49581,Lisa,"alaska, we've never met, but everyone thinks i'm your best friend."
42151,Lisa,eleven hundred and fifty bones.
49596,Lisa,there's crabby...drunky...hungry!
47457,Lisa,just because maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
45104,Lisa,test?
50667,Lisa,"um, i should probably get back to my mom. by the way, my name is--"
42995,Lisa,you were ronnie to his nancy!
46895,Lisa,"ooh, the futuresphere. it's what people in nineteen sixty-five imagined what life would be like in nineteen eighty-seven."
44785,Lisa,"look, i love bart... but he's never even read a newspaper."
49029,Lisa,"i'm delivering your scout gal cookies, mayor quimby! that'll be thirty dollars!"
49924,Lisa,"""the world below the brine / forests at the bottom of the sea / the branches and leaves... / sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."
44868,Lisa,area 51? i found area 51!
45882,Lisa,they're pigs?
49281,Lisa,"thank you, krusty!"
45758,Lisa,co-president? are you crazy?
43273,Lisa,how many more can there be?
42808,Lisa,we didn't invite the other babies. maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
52383,Lisa,discount lion safari!
50958,Lisa,"well, it's time we showed this dog some love!"
48034,Lisa,i dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system: the serfs.
50077,Lisa,there's a car in the parking lot with a yale sticker on it! it's gotta be you.
42195,Lisa,mom!
47784,Lisa,a robot?! last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. i don't have a chance now.
49893,Lisa,you're not going anywhere near annie.
42209,Lisa,fathers have to say that stuff.
42819,Lisa,sneh.
43773,Lisa,hmmm... truth.
48623,Lisa,"slow down! you're too close to that car! your hands should be at ten and two, not three and nothing!"
49163,Lisa,it always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
50653,Lisa,i'm trying to set a mood here.
41942,Lisa,"when bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? there's a moetinee."
47000,Lisa,"uh, i was just k-i-d-d-i-n-g."
49738,Lisa,fine. what's their number?
47834,Lisa,"well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
42190,Lisa,wow! my mother the actress. i feel like lucie arnaz-luckinbill.
41695,Lisa,"oh, i mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
50893,Lisa,"all due respect, mr. flanders, could i have a little privacy?"
44594,Lisa,"that's a good suggestion, mom."
49769,Lisa,"one labatty, please."
43198,Lisa,here bunny bunny! here bunny!
42279,Lisa,"dad, make bart wash his hand."
46845,Lisa,bart!
44402,Lisa,what a perfect way to end our day in new york.
46792,Lisa,i had no idea disco stu was so complex.
46539,Lisa,"thanks for listening, dad."
48352,Lisa,"he forgot the volume of the carrot nose -- one-third base times height! oh math, i have missed you!"
45951,Lisa,"it's a movie, dad."
42814,Lisa,"oh. that is so cool, that is so exciting, that is so... crappy."
48506,Lisa,how many others do you have?
42903,Lisa,relatively?
45323,Lisa,"hey, cut that out! i have an idea."
46491,Lisa,uh huh.
50649,Lisa,"wow, i've created something incredibly popular!"
42427,Lisa,the hamster has learned a valuable lesson. beware the hand of man.
51824,Lisa,you're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
49316,Lisa,"there's only one place in town where the bees can survive. and mr. burns wants to tear it down. please, people. you didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina."
48437,Lisa,"oh michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
47124,Lisa,oh luke.
51411,Lisa,they'll just reboot radioactive man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them.
46351,Lisa,we're gonna visit the place where j.c. penney sends their damaged merchandise.
44478,Lisa,i've gotta go.
49299,Lisa,"dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying!"
42413,Lisa,just screwing with your mind.
49101,Lisa,proudly edited by lisa simpson!
41893,Lisa,morning.
46344,Lisa,excuse me...
43208,Lisa,"hello. i need ecosystem of the marsh, by thompson."
46280,Lisa,"hang on, linguo. you'll be up and conjugating in no time."
43887,Lisa,"that's a hermit crab. when she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
46386,Lisa,woo hoo!
46908,Lisa,well... this could be fun. let's watch it.
52104,Lisa,"is there a reward? if she's convicted, we get t-shirts."
42377,Lisa,what do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
47987,Lisa,i don't like sausage.
51149,Lisa,"aw, c'mon."
42581,Lisa,a vampire!
51335,Lisa,i'm fine with rough.
50569,Lisa,"aww, i've always wanted an aiden..."
51450,Lisa,"bob, there's one thing i've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
46039,Lisa,he doesn't want your dirty money.
48410,Lisa,"dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?"
50956,Lisa,what?! you cry all the time! you cried when they canceled that show you hated.
45071,Lisa,i washed the dog today.
46123,Lisa,"tough break, toots. i need a man who answers to no one. a full manager."
49466,Lisa,ha! principal skinner? comic book guy? what are you doing here?
42573,Lisa,is it my imagination or is tv getting worse?
45849,Lisa,sorry. the floor's kind of at an angle here. i'm gonna move over there.
43865,Lisa,"well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... ha... i forgot to pack."
51029,Lisa,"free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch. just remember, milhouse, do not buy the condo."
50034,Lisa,tomatoes? what kind of artists are you?
48424,Lisa,"shake it off, buck!"
45106,Lisa,"""mr. toad has a red blank."" okay, skip that one. ""mr. blank needs a blank in order to blank his blank."" i am in deep blank."
48995,Lisa,do you think mine...
46857,Lisa,whatever bart is saying is a lie. mom! what happened? your endowment's bigger than harvard's.
48678,Lisa,duffman's on a date with booberella!
44234,Lisa,"well, i guess i don't have a choice..."
49580,Lisa,"well, if it's sold out, even alaska nebraska's best friend couldn't do anything about that. can't build more seats!"
50078,Lisa,i plan to attend an ivy league school myself. i do have a 4.0 gpa.
52304,Lisa,thou shalt not steal!
47564,Lisa,"something's fishy. they're not in dayton, they're somewhere fun."
46089,Lisa,and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
49411,Lisa,"woo-hoo! test day at last! now i can show off at a federal level. hey bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about ""manifest destiny?"""
42086,Lisa,nothin'.
43775,Lisa,"dad, you tell everybody everything. even moe knew when i threw up on the dentist."
50923,Lisa,you did that to help me out!
46952,Lisa,look! that's lisa leslie! she showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be six foot five!
49008,Lisa,i've gotten better since this morning. how could that have happened?
50134,Lisa,"well, he is cute. but i'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
43635,Lisa,mom! mom! mom! mom! mom!
46682,Lisa,"no, it's just dad."
45637,Lisa,"okay, guys, dinner's ready..."
45901,Lisa,"suddenly, i was invited to every birthday party. sometimes i'd have to read the cake just to know who i was singing to."
47622,Lisa,o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain...
45859,Lisa,why isn't my name in the program?
47790,Lisa,mom! dad built a device that would be deadly in the wrong hands! and he's holding it!
42986,Lisa,"no, bart, don't you see? dead people can't vote!"
49822,Lisa,wait. all that was in the recipe?
51155,Lisa,"so you're saying moe's dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?"
42533,Lisa,wow an original malibu stacey from 1958. oooh.
44068,Lisa,"mr. flanders, with all due respect, bart didn't do anything."
42536,Lisa,"wow, look at all this be sharps merchandise! lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam..."
42988,Lisa,even the pet cemetery voted for bob! look! mr. and mrs. bananas! humphrey boa-gart!
51977,Lisa,not me.
42519,Lisa,i can't believe it. our first glimpse of gabbo!
43320,Lisa,what about your family?
45957,Lisa,"dad, the arena's in olde springfield."
42356,Lisa,i did.
51891,Lisa,good. commence shovelling.
50350,Lisa,looks like there was magic between you two.
47282,Lisa,but this is my dream.
48874,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
43816,Lisa,"actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
48737,Lisa,"dad, why don't you throw me in the air, and i can see which way is out."
42059,Lisa,maybe we should write her another letter. one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
49872,Lisa,the man hates pants.
44078,Lisa,"it's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! oh, and you, dad. heh heh..."
42716,Lisa,action! i've got to talk to that woman who invented malibu stacy and see if i can get her to --
44457,Lisa,dad! it's three a.m.! can't you mutter in your room?
48862,Lisa,"oh no, i ripped it."
43877,Lisa,hi.
44760,Lisa,i told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
44608,Lisa,and how. / heck yeah. / yes they are. / you betcha.
50954,Lisa,"i love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name."
47892,Lisa,oh boy!
43285,Lisa,bart!
44232,Lisa,"hello, this is lisa simpson, and..."
46599,Lisa,"look mom, it's your car. grampa and bart must be in that theater!"
48472,Lisa,bart! what are you doing here?
49540,Lisa,it's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. the blandest food known to man.
42717,Lisa,you're getting a job.
46839,Lisa,oh.
49616,Lisa,"hey bart, did you know that's a haiku?"
50594,Lisa,hurry! we're heading for the falls!
46595,Lisa,but how? branson is a thousand miles away and we've got no car.
42082,Lisa,i quit.
44664,Lisa,"ah, shut up. savages."
43476,Lisa,"i never realized before, but some itchy and scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
43459,Lisa,awwww.
48446,Lisa,"yes, i am."
44129,Lisa,good-bye shary bobbins!
48939,Lisa,it's disgusting!
51955,Lisa,is not.
48514,Lisa,"how 'bout this for a title: ""howling at a concrete moon."""
47636,Lisa,"thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of the red dress press, dad."
44986,Lisa,"forget it, mom. i'm not going."
41986,Lisa,uh-huh.
46441,Lisa,you know it is.
43283,Lisa,maybe we were wrong about burns on this one.
41779,Lisa,"hm. an essay contest. ""children under twelve""... ""three hundred words""... ""fiercely pro-american."" sounds interesting."
46427,Lisa,"no dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
48926,Lisa,in the first place... do whatever you want. i'm getting' a candy apple.
44041,Lisa,that's so unfair!
51039,Lisa,scorrre!
51283,Lisa,"okay guys, i got your ice creams."
51470,Lisa,"o-kay. well, can you please be nicer to our grampa? for me? i love grampa. you may not realize it, but he's a treasure."
43213,Lisa,why?
48347,Lisa,yes.
49212,Lisa,it's true! he's not bluffing!
43104,Lisa,hope i do.
43222,Lisa,"and i love that painting. judging by the clothes, i'd say seventeenth century."
42408,Lisa,"hi, ralph. you were great tonight."
51745,Lisa,are there any side effects?
45793,Lisa,"please, calm down. we can work something out."
46322,Lisa,"bye, mr. flanders."
51994,Lisa,"look, maggie! birdies!"
46695,Lisa,mine tastes like dog fur.
42469,Lisa,great.
41730,Lisa,"way to go, grampa."
49985,Lisa,"so that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species?"
47140,Lisa,how can we get across?!
47897,Lisa,"wow, i was gonna say ""call reverend lovejoy,"" but i guess this could work."
47917,Lisa,snowball does tricks?
45352,Lisa,"we tried giving them eggnog at christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
42999,Lisa,oh no! we left grampa back at the gas station.
52163,Lisa,"i can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. there's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy."
50670,Lisa,ew. how 'bout i'll just look at you.
45514,Lisa,stretch dude! help!
42442,Lisa,and that's the tooth!
50871,Lisa,me neither.
45986,Lisa,"oh, the earth is the best. that's why i'm a vegetarian."
44413,Lisa,no!
44877,Lisa,"excuse me, ma'am? uh, hello? somebody? anybody?"
49104,Lisa,i can't believe what i've done -- maybe deep down i always knew how much this film would hurt them. maybe i'm the monster this movie exposed.
48070,Lisa,i didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
46494,Lisa,"here, clip-clop. here pony, pony."
43740,Lisa,"you're right, mom. i'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too."
46597,Lisa,"well, how do we get to branson?"
51399,Lisa,you like this?
48579,Lisa,maybe you just overfished them.
48651,Lisa,"dad, those kids aren't dumb. this show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!"
49522,Lisa,what will springfield be like in fifty years? let's see what the computer says:
49348,Lisa,"equalia. where everyone is equal, but we're in charge. i mean, somebody has to be, right?"
42933,Lisa,noooo!!
51560,Lisa,i'm fine.
48364,Lisa,what are you drawing?
46266,Lisa,"well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know that dr. bushwell is their best friend."
47274,Lisa,meh.
44899,Lisa,dad!
41770,Lisa,"dear bart, i am using the stationery mom and dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. perhaps if a professional so advises, i will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
45388,Lisa,"dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?"
46653,Lisa,here we are!
41881,Lisa,"no, bart. peace on earth."
46378,Lisa,you are not.
44602,Lisa,this isn't very scary.
48735,Lisa,springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!
43166,Lisa,"uh-oh. bart, you better talk to mom and dad about this."
47757,Lisa,"be careful, mom! there's hot lava under the ground!"
46742,Lisa,that's not a sunset. that's a bird on fire!
51057,Lisa,ms. cantwell?
43344,Lisa,isn't anybody gonna show up?
46069,Lisa,ya-huh!
43579,Lisa,yay!
51974,Lisa,but i don't feel like smiling.
45429,Lisa,bart! the internet is more than a global pornography network. it's a...
49112,Lisa,"wow, i guess nelson's the hot thing now. my movie will probably never be seen."
46486,Lisa,i can really celebrate christmas?
52088,Lisa,"oh, boy, ""the happy little elves meet the curious bear cub""!"
42603,Lisa,"happy halloween, everybody!"
52323,Lisa,"poor brandy. aunt selma, do you think you'll ever get married?"
46773,Lisa,"he's not my dead boyfriend, he is a dead boy who happens to be my friend. mr. bonney, i am going to make your dream come true!"
44958,Lisa,"um, i don't know. the ponies might be startled by the loud music."
50563,Lisa,coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to!
44085,Lisa,"they're good pretzels, mom. but you've got to think big. find a major public event and set up shop there."
47580,Lisa,"my theme is ""if music be the food of love."" the setting features tuning forks, champagne flutes and of course, chopsticks. and for dessert, ella fitz jell-o."
46916,Lisa,"well, maybe."
45571,Lisa,"well, we could play clam traffic jam... or the game of county seats!"
42105,Lisa,"but, mom, next week is volume four: copernicus through elephantiasis."
52424,Lisa,please don't make me do it.
48431,Lisa,i can't eat this.
46811,Lisa,"bart, i'm doing my geography homework."
44238,Lisa,"please, maggie, please go to sleep!"
45612,Lisa,let's just agree that the commercialization of christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
48041,Lisa,"i'll ignore that. in fact, i'm gonna help you. i have a pretty good idea where they are."
44245,Lisa,"dad, i'm not on drugs. i was just trying--"
46167,Lisa,"okay, we have our choice of rectangle land, cube country or squaresville."
46968,Lisa,you're baby stink-breath! you're baby stink-breath! en francais! vous etes l'enfant stink-breath!
45386,Lisa,"we are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. we have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""le sex..."" i write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! we can better ourselves!"
44936,Lisa,"oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
45103,Lisa,"""the wind in the willows?"" oh yeah, ralph brought it over."
43288,Lisa,no bart! what're you doing?
51541,Lisa,what record? stupidest death?
48109,Lisa,"uh, mom? remember how you wished we would never grow up?"
50688,Lisa,shut up and kiss me.
47727,Lisa,i'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
43965,Lisa,no.
49754,Lisa,i've never seen mr. burns this happy.
44635,Lisa,what about the rest of us?
46760,Lisa,"well, you'll be happy to know malibu stacey's fine. i really appreciate what you did, dad."
47433,Lisa,you told him our secret?!
46323,Lisa,don't throw this away. it's rod's first tooth.
42407,Lisa,"please don't leave me, george."
41726,Lisa,isn't it obvious? we've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
42558,Lisa,no.
46577,Lisa,i met one of my heroes today. she started the f--
48875,Lisa,no! no! prop eighty-seven lets big polluters off the hook!
42511,Lisa,yay!
46840,Lisa,"bart, you're my big brother. you should act like it more often. you know, protect me from the bad things in the world."
48105,Lisa,"if you don't tell mom what you did, i will."
47222,Lisa,ow!
49820,Lisa,please don't make those recipes.
44406,Lisa,sgt. skinner was a hero. he risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
46524,Lisa,why don't you file a class-action suit?
46116,Lisa,let's have a breakfast meeting.
48429,Lisa,i understand. i'm not like my dad either.
44956,Lisa,"yeah, it's great. we have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple-bobbing, apple-picking, apple everything."
49331,Lisa,"lower your expectations, lisa. public program, public program..."
47223,Lisa,doesn't this armoire belong to mr. flanders?
47168,Lisa,it's good to have you back with the simpsons.
49846,Lisa,you would mess up mom and dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
52502,Lisa,like my marriage.
48522,Lisa,but we were a team!
42158,Lisa,i've never gotten a b before.
46408,Lisa,"and we should all be thankful to michael, peter and mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
49732,Lisa,what do you care? you don't even like him.
47021,Lisa,"oh my god, you're right. i spelled it wrong. i tried my best -- and i failed!"
51176,Lisa,what is it? what is it? what is it?
47053,Lisa,hi.
45447,Lisa,don't you serve anything that's even remotely japanese?
47977,Lisa,la la la la la la la laaaaaaa.
50041,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
52215,Lisa,"as one of the simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?"
46922,Lisa,what report?
46775,Lisa,"sure. the point is, let's stop the madness and ban guns now!"
43318,Lisa,my brother just had his appendix out.
44277,Lisa,"well, i won't tell mom and dad, but only because i want the dog back. just try not to freak out the blind man."
51378,Lisa,"no, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
47437,Lisa,nothing.
46006,Lisa,now they're making popcorn...
48396,Lisa,the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom's brain.
49450,Lisa,"well, more of a curious george."
46405,Lisa,"dad, you shot moe!"
49628,Lisa,i'm in.
43829,Lisa,"no, i mean--"
47235,Lisa,i can't beat nelson.
51301,Lisa,isabel!
45894,Lisa,"oh, i really miss mom."
42510,Lisa,o.j.
48258,Lisa,oh no!
49640,Lisa,bart?!
52416,Lisa,three: you seem to be of the jewish faith.
51930,Lisa,hey! give those back!
44230,Lisa,bart?
45028,Lisa,"bart? uhh, he went to play with a friend."
51758,Lisa,"um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
48006,Lisa,"mom, bart and i have been talking..."
46134,Lisa,and you're not doing it out of spite?
51196,Lisa,something happened to dad on that trip. this is worse than when he went to new orleans and came back with the southern accent.
50867,Lisa,it's moe with wings!
46221,Lisa,"third row, near the aisle."
47077,Lisa,i'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
43640,Lisa,with tax or without?
49624,Lisa,i do.
47334,Lisa,"bart, the bar mitzvah is the most important event in a jewish boy's life. it's when he reads from the torah and becomes a man."
47287,Lisa,"bart, why don't you spend the money on something for mom? she does so much for us."
45019,Lisa,"move it, poky."
52094,Lisa,"one eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal..."
43618,Lisa,"actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency, dad. i wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
44928,Lisa,no!
49622,Lisa,stupid miss hoover.
42297,Lisa,"dad, was that your commercial?"
43245,Lisa,oh mom. thanks.
42507,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
48400,Lisa,"i'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history, mom."
51565,Lisa,what if i just taught you how to whistle?
48967,Lisa,"why are you being so quiet, bart? are you judging me? please don't judge me."
43457,Lisa,"happy to do it. but you know, bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night."
47796,Lisa,that show's gone off the air.
45450,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful, dad."
46729,Lisa,"i just wanted to belong! for once, i felt i was with intellectual equals."
45831,Lisa,"hey, where is dad?"
45425,Lisa,"wow, mom. that's very profound."
44019,Lisa,touché.
44615,Lisa,"no we don't, mother!"
44900,Lisa,you broke it!
50094,Lisa,i'm gonna do a little research.
50578,Lisa,i got the idea from every movie ever made.
46896,Lisa,what happened to you two?
42172,Lisa,i meant soon.
44698,Lisa,it can't just be a bad day. i feel like i'm getting dumber by the minute.
52511,Lisa,maybe my mom would have some ideas...
45583,Lisa,"listen, when you see what's inside this..."
43481,Lisa,they can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
49356,Lisa,i love your accent. two-nicorn. you are definitely doing the book on tape.
51023,Lisa,they're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.
49099,Lisa,"happy birthday, mom."
44709,Lisa,that didn't answer anything. i need more information.
47083,Lisa,"the best part is, next week we'll get to see the deadly meteor shower."
42327,Lisa,"all right, dad!"
43497,Lisa,"oh, apu! it's beautiful!"
51235,Lisa,i could do what i want to bart's head?
43876,Lisa,"okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. you don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."
49688,Lisa,"you heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. to ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. the moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it."
49774,Lisa,oh my gosh. it's the mascot from the 1924 games in chamonix!
49079,Lisa,orlando or hollywood?
48169,Lisa,my efforts!
44861,Lisa,22a?! then where the heck am i?
50995,Lisa,what's that stone around your neck?
42446,Lisa,now who's laughing? now who's laughing?
47147,Lisa,today balthazar will tell us about global warming in the land beyond the rainbow.
44526,Lisa,but--
52344,Lisa,pony ride! boat ride! pony ride! boat ride!
45716,Lisa,use this plastic bag.
50022,Lisa,"well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
44409,Lisa,"his name doesn't matter. ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
50699,Lisa,"dad, where are we going? do we have a plan?"
46642,Lisa,"okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer."
47876,Lisa,"don't give up, aunt selma. china has thousands of baby girls who need adoption."
43387,Lisa,"bart, he broke your dog's legs. grampa, he destroyed your home. and dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
43880,Lisa,i think i know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
52405,Lisa,"my mother would like to enroll in ""painting from life, 2-b""."
44256,Lisa,now you're making your own alcohol? that's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
44258,Lisa,"bart, how come you're not sick?"
44043,Lisa,i think they're giving up.
42354,Lisa,can't talk. comin' down.
46357,Lisa,soyghetti-o's!
46686,Lisa,how's your company gonna make money? do you have a business model?
47367,Lisa,"for all their disposable income, for all their leisure time, they had no immunity against god's lowliest creatures: children."
43478,Lisa,"dad, can't you have some other kind of party? one where you don't serve meat?"
42792,Lisa,"i think you need skinner, bart. everybody needs a nemesis. sherlock holmes had his dr. moriarty. mountain dew has its mello-yello. even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
44756,Lisa,"good luck, dad. although i am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part."
52457,Lisa,"i'm lisa -- peppy, blonde, and stunning! / sophomore prom queen five years running! goooooo lisa!"
47407,Lisa,"mom, i can't find anything on sacagawea. just a couple books on ron santo."
42826,Lisa,"look, i brought you some nice pudding."
42049,Lisa,"wow, thanks sparkle. wait, this isn't you."
50160,Lisa,"are you a distraction, or a higher calling? all right, let's see. how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives? there's, um..."
51432,Lisa,"bart, that's your sixth taco. you know, whitman says, ""if anything is sacred, the human body is sacred""."
49390,Lisa,he's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
46451,Lisa,"no it's not, it's apt! apt!"
42114,Lisa,"""honey, i hit a school bus""!"
49077,Lisa,"principal skinner, i didn't know you knew so much about film."
51266,Lisa,"but after some thought, all my worries went away."
45185,Lisa,"hey, look what i found. grampa's old radio. oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?"
47126,Lisa,"oh, it looks like a happy sheep."
48470,Lisa,"okay, guys. no one knows you're here, so be quiet. and if you get hungry, there are rats living in the christmas decorations."
43330,Lisa,what happened to mr. murphy?
48494,Lisa,he sure is neurotic for a monster.
47771,Lisa,oh!
47743,Lisa,"there's ""dan rather"" and ""tom brokaw"", hanging out with kent brockman!"
50693,Lisa,"again, i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance."
49534,Lisa,"bart, in my concurrent adventure, i learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. face things as they really are."
45099,Lisa,"no, no! yes! that's it! bite, bite, bite!"
49794,Lisa,family records for a school project on genealogical--
50270,Lisa,"sorry you broke up with your friends, mom."
51713,Lisa,it's so cool to have another musician in the family!
47634,Lisa,my poem has become an elegy. an elegy no one will ever hear.
48052,Lisa,"dad, i don't think we're gonna find mom today. and i'm sick of eating at restaurant chains i've never even heard of, like skobo's and dim willie's."
51627,Lisa,"i've been listening, and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes. mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him?"
42259,Lisa,what if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
41852,Lisa,our dad... now he belongs to the ages.
49298,Lisa,"willie, i didn't know you were an apiarist."
43498,Lisa,that's why i ran away from home.
42326,Lisa,hey! the incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. below!
45330,Lisa,dad!
45355,Lisa,"the elderly aren't like you or me, bart. they thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
50527,Lisa,goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha!
49654,Lisa,"time has passed. children play in the streets. at night, there is music and laughter."
50368,Lisa,"i believe the expression is ""ta-da!"""
44973,Lisa,"hey, guys."
42321,Lisa,"dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?"
45885,Lisa,"moe, can i give you some shrimp for the road?"
47644,Lisa,don't call me chief.
52030,Lisa,"frightened, bart? welcome to stage three: fear."
44965,Lisa,you guys have dates?
44242,Lisa,oh god! where's bart?!
51806,Lisa,we've got a big sinkhole...
43695,Lisa,that's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
44731,Lisa,"uhh, you bet i am!"
44001,Lisa,"wow, that was a good idea. and i can't believe it came from nelson."
50773,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, i have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this story."
45614,Lisa,"what's in the box, mom?"
48382,Lisa,forgive me for this.
49577,Lisa,"l'ecole, c'est moi!"
41824,Lisa,"hey, quit it, bart. quit it! hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! m-o-o-o-m!"
44626,Lisa,hoverbikes!!
48251,Lisa,"willie, there are no more lessons. you're a proper gentleman, my work is done."
44622,Lisa,we love the leader!
43566,Lisa,"mona simpson, mona stevens, martha stewart, penelope olsen, muddy mae suggins..."
42852,Lisa,"hello? hey, i'm stuck in here. i gotta think of a way to get out."
47912,Lisa,we're not overfeeding her. we've been giving her this low-fat cat food!
44128,Lisa,i'm getting used to never getting noticed.
43331,Lisa,bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
46498,Lisa,these hotels are made of legos.
41613,Lisa,i sure am hungry for my favorite food...
48541,Lisa,you actually convinced people not to go to nelson's party?
46011,Lisa,"ew, someone's been marking their territory."
45755,Lisa,bart!
48703,Lisa,not interested.
51709,Lisa,"a brass band... barbershop quintet?... the human kazoo... ooh, a drum circle!"
46947,Lisa,"'bye, mom!"
44564,Lisa,"hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks? that'll make us feel better."
50379,Lisa,raymondo! you forgive me!
42714,Lisa,it's awful being a kid. no one listens to you.
51010,Lisa,"well, the obvious question is... why did i turn out so... academically superior... while bart--"
45752,Lisa,"as you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from president trump. how bad is it, secretary van houten?"
50031,Lisa,"oh maggie, don't ever turn two."
42448,Lisa,arrrgh!
50339,Lisa,affirmative.
42213,Lisa,to shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
43096,Lisa,"but if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways."
44840,Lisa,what if i took a bus?
48710,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't wanna play?"
52334,Lisa,heehaw!
41910,Lisa,snowball ii... santa's little helper... this is princess. please don't exclude her because she's different.
45234,Lisa,throw your peanuts!
43488,Lisa,"why don't you just eat him, dad."
43916,Lisa,"i believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
46442,Lisa,"well, at least it's tasteful."
43152,Lisa,mom?
49045,Lisa,mom! we need a callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!
43988,Lisa,"oh, okay. can i stay up?"
45869,Lisa,yes?!
47777,Lisa,why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
48480,Lisa,now it's a collection of candle kiosks and persian cd stores.
47297,Lisa,yes.
51676,Lisa,judge-judge-judge--
42350,Lisa,they're all around me. no way out. no way out i tell you!
47540,Lisa,"dad, i still have a couple-a questions about this. mom never drives drunk, and the crash was in your car. also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach..."
50402,Lisa,as big as a baby's head.
48256,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. i brought something that'll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!"
42737,Lisa,"dad, did you hear something?"
42081,Lisa,what's the point? they'll never notice.
45282,Lisa,"they're not all crazy, dad."
45910,Lisa,swings!
46511,Lisa,"dad's on the log. now mom, you get the car and pull them to safety."
45431,Lisa,"dad, that's fox!"
46070,Lisa,ya-huh!
46849,Lisa,"i win, dad. that means i get to choose today's father-daughter activity!"
48687,Lisa,"bart, it's not saturday."
44665,Lisa,oh rats! talk about bad luck! i forgot to wear socks today. guess i can't try those on.
51369,Lisa,principal skinner? i object to this arbitrary use of power and request i be taken off the list.
45677,Lisa,"bart, i hope you don't believe your own hype."
43423,Lisa,"hey, c'mon! those are prescription shoes! i need them!"
52002,Lisa,the answers to deep theological questions..
49086,Lisa,i'm making a documentary about a very special family.
48122,Lisa,i'm worried about mom. she's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours.
44790,Lisa,that wasn't news. that was sappy manipulative drivel.
42454,Lisa,eww.
43049,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing in my room?"
46461,Lisa,"no! look, i'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. i'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
49289,Lisa,"oh, such beautiful packaging! i never thought a company could be my soul mate!"
42769,Lisa,mr. blackheart?
43046,Lisa,"don't worry, bart, they won't bother you anymore."
46214,Lisa,i believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
51853,Lisa,then all the reindeer loved him / as they shouted out with glee / rudolph the red nosed reindeer / you'll go down in history...
42267,Lisa,sorry bart.
43610,Lisa,"i admit i haven't known mom as long as you have, but i know when she's really upset. her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. it absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
44465,Lisa,"can we go swimmin', mom?"
45156,Lisa,"oh, poor mark hamill."
48747,Lisa,"no, boy, that's hanukah."
43338,Lisa,"uh, maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
48207,Lisa,santa must have left it.
46283,Lisa,sentence fragment is also a sentence fragment.
43846,Lisa,how else would you know?
46528,Lisa,godspeed.
48133,Lisa,"oh dad, how could you?"
47341,Lisa,"it's great, dad. you have tremendous power. and now it's time to put it to use."
51675,Lisa,i am judging you.
52327,Lisa,is too.
47254,Lisa,"look, in the swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance--"
46197,Lisa,"yeah, she's a real purist."
43972,Lisa,we've got to go down there and help dad!
42503,Lisa,in here!
46381,Lisa,"well, why don't you do something about it?"
51433,Lisa,won't those vegetables go bad?
50163,Lisa,"mom, i admire everything you do--"
44206,Lisa,uch! the idea that you would compare yourself to mahatma gandhi...
42421,Lisa,how can a hamster write mysteries?
44711,Lisa,dear log: my worst fears have been confirmed. i've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. what will my life be like after i descend into mediocrity?
48152,Lisa,"yeah, i warned you about that."
51626,Lisa,mom? dad?
50484,Lisa,"da-ad! anyway, continuing: ""for the present i will only say that this 'landowner' -- for so..."""
47712,Lisa,no thanks. i'm gonna stay in the library and do a little reading.
45328,Lisa,everyone's gone!
44699,Lisa,what are you talkin' about?
48783,Lisa,"dad, that's ludicrous!"
50235,Lisa,"oh really? well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet santa?"
49805,Lisa,that's all there is -- the rest of the diary has turned to dust!
45694,Lisa,it looks great. i can't believe we scrubbed that old man smell out of a hundred and thirty-seven rooms.
51639,Lisa,"no, whenever anything bothers me i harmlessly vent it to maggie."
46871,Lisa,yeah! go ice-o-topes!
46319,Lisa,i thought you didn't like her.
51239,Lisa,"rainbow... oh, rainbow..."
43763,Lisa,sure!
47429,Lisa,you did not.
43280,Lisa,let's go find your babies!
45389,Lisa,"dad, stop kidding around. look, they printed my letter."
41627,Lisa,"declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--"
48115,Lisa,"please don't accept this invitation, dad. hunting is cruel."
50920,Lisa,but i promised paul mccartney i wouldn't eat meat.
51387,Lisa,nothing is easy to wrap. i have trouble with scissors!
45129,Lisa,but what i did was wrong.
50460,Lisa,skinner's involved in this. deep.
46607,Lisa,...and please bless mama and papa and bartrand and coco chanel...
52477,Lisa,how do i get down?
43715,Lisa,i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and...
49151,Lisa,"thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
42340,Lisa,"aunt selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
42128,Lisa,we don't have seatbelts.
47134,Lisa,...but a quicker way to the ranch is that shortcut.
50573,Lisa,i'm sorry.
50622,Lisa,"maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing."
42103,Lisa,checkers.
49810,Lisa,what are you doing? i wanna know what happens next.
45709,Lisa,"hello, i'd like to speak to president clinton, please. i wrote to him and he never wrote back... no, i don't want al gore!"
49713,Lisa,"better change your mind quick, bart. a snow plow's coming to seal us in."
46162,Lisa,super-liminal?
44213,Lisa,"bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when mom and dad get home. now go to bed!"
44496,Lisa,"hey, they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow. that's where they discovered all those fossils!"
49566,Lisa,"uh, who's alaska nebraska?"
42691,Lisa,isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?
46812,Lisa,"stop, i want to learn on my own!"
45051,Lisa,what's wrong with the tv?
49058,Lisa,come on!
45187,Lisa,and guess who's been practicing medicine without a license...
45962,Lisa,"well, the book festival starts today..."
51058,Lisa,more than i want unicorns to be real!
45531,Lisa,that has people living in it. you can see them through the windows.
41808,Lisa,"mr. lincoln, i..."
43590,Lisa,don't you see? that would be taking the easy way out --
48281,Lisa,"aw dad, did my story make you cry?"
41589,Lisa,stop telling me that.
48225,Lisa,we've only brought in five dollars. and that came from mr. flanders buying back his own stuff.
44335,Lisa,ned! ned! mr. flanders!
48767,Lisa,"i am. you're on a bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man."
52144,Lisa,"for your information, i'm about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe."
43587,Lisa,"high-toned voice. bart, that's it. i know where sideshow bob is hiding."
52406,Lisa,mom...
41663,Lisa,a fight? that would mean rejecting the last part of me that's still a girl.
42756,Lisa,they're having a great time and i'm stuck in here.
45802,Lisa,it does?
42040,Lisa,wish i'd thought of that.
42330,Lisa,hardly. i'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
47198,Lisa,"dad, you've become the new grim reaper!"
44751,Lisa,ralph? but the rocket was my idea.
50435,Lisa,returning this lost key to principal skinner.
48430,Lisa,there's a triple a battery in my macaroni and cheese!
46435,Lisa,we'll never find the body under all this water.
51706,Lisa,a world of anarchic free expression!
47151,Lisa,"i'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track."
42257,Lisa,what's wrong?
51841,Lisa,"oh, no!"
48594,Lisa,no.
45721,Lisa,"that's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned."
47556,Lisa,"that's kaballah, jerk!"
46449,Lisa,"they should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"
49518,Lisa,"dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into maggie?"
46891,Lisa,i can't believe you went to the movies with the teacher. what happened to the bart simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?
48510,Lisa,because i suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.
42400,Lisa,"now you listen to me -- i don't like you. i never liked you, and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is `cause nobody else would!"
42815,Lisa,it looks like part of scratchy's arm.
47078,Lisa,does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
43317,Lisa,yeah.
44736,Lisa,"beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. you can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower..."
47402,Lisa,i have to research a paper. where did all the books go?
50757,Lisa,"that's sexist, but thank you."
49403,Lisa,aha!
45933,Lisa,oh yeah? what's his name?
52525,Lisa,"oh right, it's dr. seuss's birthday."
50903,Lisa,"four threes?! oh no! no-no-no-no-no, nooooo!"
49878,Lisa,"hmm... dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" and only one site is sacred to muslims, christians and jews -- the dome of the rock!"
51746,Lisa,"so, you use a lot of solar energy?"
49252,Lisa,dad? did you come into some money we don't know about?
45392,Lisa,"chief wiggum! oh, you sure got a lotta copies of the paper."
51789,Lisa,"mr. musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?"
45128,Lisa,she doesn't know. you're the only one i've told.
41708,Lisa,baboon!
49787,Lisa,i can't wait to see what noble branches lie in the simpson family foliage!
41982,Lisa,whoo-hoo!
52040,Lisa,still kinda ticked off.
45641,Lisa,"so, how was your day?"
50477,Lisa,"yeah, so he could shoot it himself. franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war two!"
44235,Lisa,complete confidentiality? oh. and i'm sure he's as good as dr. hibbert. it says so right in his ad.
42430,Lisa,got it.
46249,Lisa,"i know, but..."
49069,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but as a filmmaker i have to face the truth."
43794,Lisa,mo-om! someone threw gum in my hair!
46977,Lisa,"wow, this place is great. that couch looks really pricey."
44219,Lisa,ba-art!
44031,Lisa,"i know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
51452,Lisa,you already ate all the chocolate bars.
41753,Lisa,"that's okay, bart. nobody really believed it. we were just trying to scare you."
50892,Lisa,four queens! yes! yes!!!
48837,Lisa,"as this month's rotating president of the springfield future scientists club, may i say: i'm sorry. and is there anything we can do to help?"
43365,Lisa,"mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
50096,Lisa,we're brother and sister.
43458,Lisa,"we're going to storytown village, grampa. it's an amusement park for babies."
52121,Lisa,did too.
51002,Lisa,"...but, bart, i do know this: you will not do better than mary spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game!"
44537,Lisa,it's gone...
43290,Lisa,"bart, look! a laundry chute!"
50418,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna find out why, because this..."
42474,Lisa,paper.
52482,Lisa,"hands off, hands off. eh, screw it! sometimes a mother's job is to butt in."
52262,Lisa,maybe there's something else to do on this planet.
50510,Lisa,video game convention!
43296,Lisa,"well, mr. burns, i hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion."
42801,Lisa,"oh, i see. if you testify, skinner will know you skipped school. well, if freddy quimby didn't do it, i'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury."
51098,Lisa,"mr. burns, i came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. and the man i'm looking for would help me find the truth."
41922,Lisa,all the years i've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
41939,Lisa,you're telling who?
49719,Lisa,slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
52521,Lisa,"lisa simpson, the following people want to friend you."
50897,Lisa,how did he...
45956,Lisa,"dad, you're bleeding."
47182,Lisa,i'm so proud of what you guys are doing. i even tipped off the local paper.
47766,Lisa,...hind the 'fridgerator...
49975,Lisa,"dad, i'm gonna need some help getting this off."
47112,Lisa,...it's christmas time in the city...
45442,Lisa,"look, there's the imperial gardens... the meiji shrine... the hello kitty factory..."
46355,Lisa,isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
47669,Lisa,the barney bugle?
52332,Lisa,a long-lost half-brother. how dickensian!
49825,Lisa,"my black history month presentation is called ""the simpsons: the first family of freedom."""
47872,Lisa,"bart, you were gonna burn the third nice thing you've ever done for me?"
50194,Lisa,now they're dancing on his grave!
47416,Lisa,"bart, you're in my family."
45659,Lisa,we better check with a doctor.
45433,Lisa,"eww, we're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-cent store?"
50373,Lisa,you don't open the top -- the locks are real.
42325,Lisa,oh dad.
47959,Lisa,looks like you guys are on the mend.
47530,Lisa,can we go? can we go? please! please! please! please! please!
41810,Lisa,"mr. jefferson, my name is lisa simpson, and i have a problem."
48121,Lisa,you mean this?
42612,Lisa,what is it?
51949,Lisa,"it's not that kind of sad. i'm sorry, dad, but you wouldn't understand."
46508,Lisa,"gabriel, are you okay?"
46034,Lisa,something's wrong. terribly wrong.
46997,Lisa,ac/dc!
47207,Lisa,there you are.
42060,Lisa,"""though i'll be inoculating babies in kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
43704,Lisa,"but i've caused so much trouble already, general washington. i can't go on."
44339,Lisa,"oh, those poor monkeys."
48517,Lisa,"moe, you're a published author!"
47049,Lisa,now we just need a distraction.
46545,Lisa,this is not a good time.
49256,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
42870,Lisa,i'm going for first chair this year.
51818,Lisa,"ooh, mom. someone wants you to give them a ride."
42452,Lisa,"hey, we know you're tough, dad. remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
42480,Lisa,... then we put your name on the script and sent it in.
43369,Lisa,"so, mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?"
44702,Lisa,this is just two years ago!
48964,Lisa,give me an indian burn!
41592,Lisa,is that robot break-dancing?
44370,Lisa,will you stop looking at your feet?!
44872,Lisa,"uh-huh. um, listen, i'm kind of lost. do you think you could give me a lift downtown?"
48977,Lisa,"""congratulations on purchasing the sanyo dl30, the finest non-reversing tape player..."""
42653,Lisa,dad!
52464,Lisa,"oh, that's an excellent use of a genius brain: to look after an idiot head."
44399,Lisa,"okay, dad..."
43571,Lisa,"dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
43424,Lisa,no i don't!
41894,Lisa,mom! dad!
47085,Lisa,"mr. mayor, you can't flip-flop on this! we'll miss the meteor shower."
46250,Lisa,"oh, now come on..."
42422,Lisa,"oh, come on."
51007,Lisa,"no, you're watching baby poindexter, the most educational dvd available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!"
47652,Lisa,i think it distracts people from more important social issues.
50555,Lisa,"this is how real writers do it. i'll just bang out two thousand words and then i'll stop, even if i'm on fire. i gotta pace myself. ""chapter one."" wait, i can't start without music to inspire me."
45690,Lisa,but housesitting is a sacred...
41620,Lisa,got any joyce carol oates?
51786,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
50681,Lisa,mulberry island. we'll kiss there at sunset.
50370,Lisa,"shut up! now, where were we?"
47468,Lisa,"all right, so what else is goin' on? let's see... hey! why do they call them field trips? we never go to a field!"
44590,Lisa,there is something worse...
49756,Lisa,this isn't normal tv. it's a videogame that encourages activity and exercise!
43454,Lisa,"i would like to say grace. lord, have mercy on my soul, and mom's soul, and dad's soul, and maggie's soul, and let every soul in christendom..."
50517,Lisa,are there at least games here?
51885,Lisa,me first!
52289,Lisa,why?
42199,Lisa,"no, no, that's too much."
50463,Lisa,so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
41862,Lisa,let's move.
48671,Lisa,happy birthday dear homer / happy birthday to you!
50245,Lisa,oh no! this is where they took mom from me!
46005,Lisa,awww.
44503,Lisa,this is so exciting! i can't wait to see what we find!
46885,Lisa,sideshow bob!
50232,Lisa,you mean your gingerbread mcmansion.
46020,Lisa,he cut off his favorite dread!
42658,Lisa,"we are insured, aren't we, mom?"
49645,Lisa,"it's pronounced ""d.n.a.,"" you idiot. and we are not the same -- i am not a murderer, and i never will be!"
44550,Lisa,"""on the closing day!/ the escrow agents pay!/ taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to fannie mae!"""
48730,Lisa,"see? ""may cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""
51109,Lisa,"you know, if you're gonna be a hero, you might not want to tent your fingers like that."
45725,Lisa,i'm taking my name off this thing.
44906,Lisa,do do do do-do / do do do do-do / do do do do do do do do.
51172,Lisa,"he said he went home, and his passport is gone. what country is he from?"
46015,Lisa,"ooh, it's morning. i gotta get back!"
44246,Lisa,"hey, bart. how's your arm?"
44948,Lisa,they left without me.
51600,Lisa,"our lord, buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear."
44768,Lisa,i know. i already jumped to that conclusion.
52417,Lisa,or italian?
49230,Lisa,"guess what, mom? i'm a cruciverbalist!"
51927,Lisa,well... hm...
41818,Lisa,i can't believe it! the system works.
42873,Lisa,mom.
50363,Lisa,raymondo's greatest secret!
41912,Lisa,"dad, i think princess belongs in a stable."
42251,Lisa,bart! you cast the wrong spell! zombies!
51604,Lisa,hey! are you coming to the afterschool pool party?
42829,Lisa,"good luck, dad."
46755,Lisa,thus ends the rule of law.
45892,Lisa,poor maggie. how many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life?
42588,Lisa,look!
43601,Lisa,"oh no. inside, the evil bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
51723,Lisa,bart! you know you can't open a present till mom and dad wake up!
46436,Lisa,"hey, what's that over there?"
47898,Lisa,how do you know that's their blimp?
44866,Lisa,hey!
46132,Lisa,goodbye.
44721,Lisa,no!!
52479,Lisa,i know where mine is...
42374,Lisa,yeah. nice gag.
50957,Lisa,how did santa's little helper get in there?
47520,Lisa,"oh dad, i missed you so much."
51314,Lisa,"i'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, i'm not pigeonholing... is it a catholic thing?"
52168,Lisa,"but, dad. we're simple people with simple values. capital city is too big and too complex. everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us."
51065,Lisa,eleanor roosevelt became franklin's 'eyes and ears...'
45575,Lisa,bart broke all my books.
42759,Lisa,"he's hungry. here you go, stampy. eat it slow. it has to last for..."
46000,Lisa,he said i was hard core.
46594,Lisa,he must have dropped this.
51762,Lisa,i thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
52275,Lisa,"nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time."
47076,Lisa,we've got to do something. i know --maybe we can get people to sign a petition.
44692,Lisa,i'm finished. i've just got to...oh... there!
46923,Lisa,"you read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
45049,Lisa,hey!
50665,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna look at the desserts!"
45415,Lisa,"no, kent. we're gonna use the power of good ideas to change things for the better..."
50269,Lisa,"hey, does dad know you and the cool moms broke up?"
49257,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
42444,Lisa,april first used to be the pagan new year.
46570,Lisa,"maggie, what do you think?"
45508,Lisa,i don't think the real radioactive man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
45822,Lisa,"dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. you're supposed to open the magazine."
42292,Lisa,uh-huh.
48929,Lisa,mo-om!
50018,Lisa,"that's right! strike the set, pizza party..."
45794,Lisa,"bart, you're supposed to be at camp david."
43073,Lisa,"dad, you did it! i am so proud of you."
52273,Lisa,"as usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. sushi is considered quite a delicacy."
49608,Lisa,i thought you were studying the lincoln-douglas debates?
42762,Lisa,"he can't just eat peanuts, dad. he needs plants to live."
41629,Lisa,but i am just a simple librarian. i have only read about dancing in books.
46103,Lisa,"oh, no. he wouldn't!"
50050,Lisa,"so nelson, i see you started a small business."
48458,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna lose it! bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""blowin'"" and ""the sugar sheet""."
45383,Lisa,"people, stop! stop! we're not animals!"
43746,Lisa,ah-huh.
49763,Lisa,"well, you still should have let them have their fun!"
45131,Lisa,"well, if you're gonna cover this up, i'll just have to go over your head to super--"
50244,Lisa,... ... ...
42343,Lisa,there it is!
48883,Lisa,sideshow bob!
44017,Lisa,"oh, please. milhouse likes vaseline on toast."
45023,Lisa,so what prize did you end up getting?
49980,Lisa,"mom, it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture. he drives a hybrid!"
46650,Lisa,guys!
47545,Lisa,"taco, please."
51976,Lisa,thanks.
47952,Lisa,maybe we could shop somewhere else. there's a farm stand next door.
47711,Lisa,what?! i'm not fat enough already? how could you say that to me?
49854,Lisa,"elementary, my dear simpson."
45969,Lisa,what a waste...
50949,Lisa,at the art walk we walked into a gallery and it was just a guy crying -- that was the art!
44913,Lisa,"hey, public display."
48376,Lisa,"ow, that hurt."
47881,Lisa,"uh, let's talk about this outside."
42032,Lisa,"come on, dad!"
50271,Lisa,"come on, pretend he meant something to you."
45171,Lisa,whoa / curfew?
48214,Lisa,"""my dearest mona. you've just left my arms to return to your husband, abe, and already i ache for you."""
44175,Lisa,"that's a trust, janey. a sacred trust."
49576,Lisa,i didn't think i'd get a fresh start like this till junior high!
46610,Lisa,god spoke to me -- i must obey.
43858,Lisa,"mom, why don't i have any friends?"
43697,Lisa,"there is one way: get the silver tongue. if jebediah's who i say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
52066,Lisa,"oh, bart."
48335,Lisa,i'm starting to think the sea captain isn't coming back.
46550,Lisa,he must have taken a job in the west springfield oil patch. that's practically a death sentence!
50951,Lisa,"please, please take me with you! i am one of you! i understood all your references!"
52225,Lisa,"mom, i poured my heart into that centerpiece! things like that always happen in this family!"
52205,Lisa,oatmeal.
48452,Lisa,'cause i've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! how would bart like it if i just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?
49268,Lisa,"""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" wow, it's almost as if dad planted that message. no, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?"
50819,Lisa,on a one-way train to be milhouse's bride...
45818,Lisa,what?
44177,Lisa,but... but i'm very mature for my age. people often mistake me for nine.
49956,Lisa,excuse me! is this what the framers of the constitution would want?
50178,Lisa,"i have a future! thank you, mom!"
52148,Lisa,"while i pondered, weak and weary,"
46924,Lisa,"i was framed! you believe me, don't you dad?"
43508,Lisa,...too.
45072,Lisa,of course not.
47304,Lisa,push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
42574,Lisa,wait! doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
45322,Lisa,we'll never be able to swim that far.
50800,Lisa,"let me explain. i have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if i give up hope. now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, i would like to be alone."
48217,Lisa,"no, but he told us to say hi. hi!"
49501,Lisa,"don't you mean ""pint""?"
45182,Lisa,nelson.
50023,Lisa,"okay, maybe it won't be that bad."
49993,Lisa,"we're watching the nobel prize announcements, live from stockholm!"
49706,Lisa,"you can have mine, but he's kind of an idiot."
50136,Lisa,how'd you do that?
51224,Lisa,"you know, dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
47148,Lisa,each year we lose seven species of gumdrops...
45038,Lisa,but aren't the snakes even worse?
45889,Lisa,it's my favorite!
51193,Lisa,point taken.
41700,Lisa,"thank you, mr. bergstrom."
41595,Lisa,"look, if you want jenda to take you back you should show some initiative. get a job."
43998,Lisa,"oh, how does bart do this every week?"
43986,Lisa,you're a grand old flag / you're a high flying flag / etc...
43207,Lisa,aaagh. him again.
46489,Lisa,"yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys."
43990,Lisa,you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
50972,Lisa,"guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one? i for one am glad we're stuck with civilization and i think we will be for a long, long time."
43394,Lisa,look at burns' suit. yeesh.
42660,Lisa,"what, this jug?"
52519,Lisa,butt out.
49437,Lisa,this is the lowest we've sunk.
52077,Lisa,"come on, bart. go with the flow."
47324,Lisa,"i just wanted to see what it was like. howdy, y'all. if you don't like mah song, i'll spray ya with ink!"
46574,Lisa,"i said ""let's go""."
51510,Lisa,"okay, calm down. maybe he's talking about margaret mead."
42078,Lisa,"my god, they are stubby."
42725,Lisa,that's awful!
43386,Lisa,everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns. even us.
51823,Lisa,eight.
47425,Lisa,"bart, there's spiders in your hair."
43963,Lisa,those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
42597,Lisa,"uh, dad, that's his crotch."
49510,Lisa,"i don't understand. dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. plus he loves mom, and us, yada, yada, yada."
50262,Lisa,dad's underwear!
50309,Lisa,...and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind. because dad drugged you!
43053,Lisa,get out! get out!
45692,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. i'm sure he'll be okay."
45916,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
47348,Lisa,dad? are you okay?
52333,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?
44998,Lisa,"oh, act your age."
48744,Lisa,um... i don't think he's ever thought about anything.
45915,Lisa,so this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
49309,Lisa,"oh mom, it's perfect!"
44671,Lisa,he said there's no shame in their forbidden love.
43325,Lisa,i sure am. look!
43941,Lisa,"oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. bart's just my brother."
51190,Lisa,hey!
51761,Lisa,"well, i guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched."
49214,Lisa,"what are we, a piano bar?"
45645,Lisa,no it's not!
43322,Lisa,when was the last time you worked?
44424,Lisa,wave of da future!
50975,Lisa,"wait a minute... if you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school!"
49304,Lisa,how long is that?
43857,Lisa,grown-up nerds like gore vidal. and even he's kissed more boys than i ever will.
49676,Lisa,i worship nature!
48761,Lisa,jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. but i can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.
42896,Lisa,what's this?
49043,Lisa,"aw, cheer up, you've still got your talent, and that new song you wrote is gonna be a really big hit."
42668,Lisa,"wow! how'd you track him down, grampa?"
46041,Lisa,"dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?"
42335,Lisa,we're under six!
50714,Lisa,da-ad!
48739,Lisa,finally! i knew we could solve that maze using tremaux's algorithm.
43289,Lisa,that's cats.
49834,Lisa,there's no noble simpson.
43420,Lisa,"cheer up, bart. milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low."
46918,Lisa,they're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...
45441,Lisa,it's breathtaking.
47025,Lisa,"you have made me feel so wonderful. thank you, springfield!"
42004,Lisa,"you know, dad, sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
44255,Lisa,"mo-om!! prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"
48003,Lisa,"well, i think you're the sweetest dad in the whole world."
50718,Lisa,we're actually entering dad's dreams?
47833,Lisa,"why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? we can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
46370,Lisa,"the dark lord montymort, absorber of souls, sucker of essence!"
51575,Lisa,gus huebner? is that you?
47404,Lisa,i can't.
52060,Lisa,i didn't do it!
47432,Lisa,milhouse? i thought your mom took you away forever.
41669,Lisa,focus!
46897,Lisa,"mom, is that principal skinner sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?"
46722,Lisa,non-dairy?
44209,Lisa,excuse me?
45785,Lisa,"ooh, but bart could screw everything up..."
51323,Lisa,"listen, we're both eight years old. can't we just play monopoly or something?"
47776,Lisa,"if you're feeling depressed, do what i do and write something. a novel, a play..."
50601,Lisa,"you're not licked, krusty. people love a comeback. look at robert downey junior... mickey rourke..."
48587,Lisa,this is not what i wanted at all!
50618,Lisa,no question about it.
43436,Lisa,or the way dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
50829,Lisa,meaningless friend thing.
49147,Lisa,"i don't know, i guess he forgot, but people seemed to like me last week."
50357,Lisa,you never even opened it.
50743,Lisa,it's so diverse! i've died and gone to a pbs kids show!
43921,Lisa,ow! what's that supposed to prove?
42626,Lisa,"tsk, tsk. the remorse of the sugar junkie."
46979,Lisa,"it's three hundred, mom."
44815,Lisa,"you know, bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news."
43700,Lisa,i was so sure...
41957,Lisa,ariel.
44673,Lisa,"one's residential, the other is business."
46836,Lisa,hey!
48448,Lisa,yes...
48570,Lisa,end of story.
45087,Lisa,but i'm hardly learning at all.
51085,Lisa,sorry.
44318,Lisa,congratulations...
49642,Lisa,"what if i gave you homework help? i won't give you the answers, but i'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
42802,Lisa,i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
46797,Lisa,...while you're spending the week at...
43525,Lisa,"bart, you're in trouble! wake up!"
46791,Lisa,"hey, i read about this show in teen modern maturity. they film passengers with hidden cameras and catch them at their most uninhibited."
43339,Lisa,grampa!
46814,Lisa,"what's this weird mark next to my ""a""?"
45036,Lisa,wow. did you know they had those web flaps for gliding?
45202,Lisa,"okay, now we just have to stick the feet on."
52130,Lisa,why are you trying to scare us? are you trying to keep us from getting close to you... maybe even loving you?
41919,Lisa,what's wrong with dad?
43860,Lisa,be myself? i've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. look at all these dorky clothes... a bathing cap... nose plugs...
46608,Lisa,but i'm just a little girl.
51364,Lisa,what are you doing?
51440,Lisa,oh my god! it's worse than i thought. everybody wait here while i do some actual research. nobody form any opinions while i'm gone.
49189,Lisa,mom! bart's flicking boogers on me!
51186,Lisa,happy anniversary!
49543,Lisa,old comedy writers who now have to work at our kitchen.
50239,Lisa,don't dare bring that thing in here!
50436,Lisa,"well, maybe a little. but i'd never break the rules."
43135,Lisa,oh.
47989,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. you were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business."
45226,Lisa,"mom, bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
42882,Lisa,but she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
48886,Lisa,"actually, you made one. what shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
52456,Lisa,as am i.
46901,Lisa,"hey, i could really use one of those."
44268,Lisa,"in a truth-telling contest. right, bart?"
46712,Lisa,you guys are college students!
45993,Lisa,"oh, i didn't think it would be so high... maybe i could just circulate a petition..."
50238,Lisa,can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army?
43284,Lisa,he's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!
43973,Lisa,who's playing that music?
45331,Lisa,"dad, i really need to rest my back."
44851,Lisa,"look! it's the bus! the bus! come on, you're gonna miss the bus!"
43137,Lisa,"sounds like you had a good day today, dad."
46353,Lisa,maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
49538,Lisa,cinco.
48475,Lisa,sure.
50392,Lisa,my lick.
44418,Lisa,"look, mama!"
47027,Lisa,"come on, come on, let's get to the beach!"
46951,Lisa,"that's fung pang-li, the seven-foot sensation from szechwan!"
47838,Lisa,"aunt patty, where did you two meet? alternative book store? ethiopian restaurant?"
47314,Lisa,"wow, look at all this stuff."
51287,Lisa,"that's it, maggie! use the dino-wand!"
41835,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
44511,Lisa,"well, obviously that's impossible--"
46320,Lisa,"we're the neighbors, and we don't think."
49349,Lisa,gosh. this is all happening so fast. i don't know what to say.
43944,Lisa,"principal skinner, wait! i created the universe! give me the gift certificate!"
46703,Lisa,thanks. i'll see you in heaven.
42959,Lisa,okay.
51203,Lisa,mom! i have to tell you something about dad! something big!
43617,Lisa,"red, green, yellow, orange! i remember all of these!"
50157,Lisa,"no offense dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams."
46748,Lisa,that caterpillar is screaming.
45304,Lisa,"wow, dad and bart have been everywhere! they've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies."
47843,Lisa,no it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! look at it!
49852,Lisa,mom said she was tipped off by a note from me. but you know something? i didn't write this note.
48385,Lisa,thank you. or should i say thank you!
48791,Lisa,"mr. brockman, you're a huge hit!"
42853,Lisa,"bart, i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately. i got carried away with being popular. but now that i'm unpopular again, i want you to know i'm here for you."
50112,Lisa,that dinger was a fluke! not that i have to defend myself to you. managers manage and players play.
46077,Lisa,we did.
45270,Lisa,no-ho-ho...
43162,Lisa,"uh-huh. in fact, in rand-mcnally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people."
43418,Lisa,"or from your point of view, m and s... maggie simpson."
46758,Lisa,"dad, that's bart."
47640,Lisa,"perfect. you're our tv critic. ralph, what about you?"
46846,Lisa,"listen, we're really sorry. we got lost on a field trip from springfield elementary!"
44753,Lisa,ralph! ralph! ralph! ralph!
44686,Lisa,"okay, let's see, it's not egyptian. it's not prince's names."
47231,Lisa,hey... student body president...
51578,Lisa,tumi? but you're from the other second grade. we only come together for tornado drills.
46679,Lisa,ooh! here's a wonderful speaker! geoff jenkins!
47428,Lisa,"um... some other time, maybe. today i'm just hanging out at home."
49837,Lisa,yes! i'm thrilled! we've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
48336,Lisa,...and you've got the elderly jewish couple making their first trip to israel.
42443,Lisa,"like halloween and christmas, april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
51008,Lisa,bart? you wanted to show me something?
43016,Lisa,"i can't believe it, bart. i'd always thought jessica was so sweet."
52287,Lisa,john shaft.
50450,Lisa,i swear there was a room here!
43591,Lisa,he's getting away!
44387,Lisa,"""dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan..."""
43430,Lisa,"yeah. it seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy pat boone-ish quality to it."
48759,Lisa,"principal skinner, you know we have only one agent who stands a chance with those bullies. my brother."
52230,Lisa,"dear log, my brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because i failed to take his abuse with good humor. i miss him so much already, that i don't know..."
44774,Lisa,"come on, quit foolin' around, you guys."
50201,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns is here for you again."
48796,Lisa,oh my god! you don't suppose they're gonna start--
45585,Lisa,that's the doll that attacked me!
51596,Lisa,"i'm fine. fine! it's funny, but... hurting your feelings made me feel better."
47781,Lisa,wheeee!
44237,Lisa,mag-gie!
48649,Lisa,"well it's nice to see you again, krusty, but these kids have field trip journals to write!"
48711,Lisa,all this fuss for a baseball game? why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
43297,Lisa,"oh, yeah. i didn't think this was for me."
46631,Lisa,why must you fight with every utility?
43139,Lisa,"don't you realize what's happening, bart? your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
42478,Lisa,"grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
44330,Lisa,"look, we got a package from the mr. sparkle company in japan!"
49107,Lisa,"ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
48892,Lisa,he wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
44340,Lisa,okay.
41749,Lisa,"oh, yeah? what's my shoe size?"
43230,Lisa,"mom, picture phone."
46750,Lisa,top suspects?
48643,Lisa,hm... maybe the best way to begin your education is to get you some exposure to the wider world. so i'm gonna take you to downtown springfield!
50857,Lisa,"dad, don't pat it!"
49746,Lisa,i am her / she is me / i'm just like / penelope...
43961,Lisa,that's an electric nostril groomer.
48324,Lisa,what secrets?
44644,Lisa,wait! we're not savages! we live in a society of law. milhouse has the right to a fair trial!
44748,Lisa,wowww!
44270,Lisa,"no. they went for a walk with the flanders. bart, what's going on? why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
51392,Lisa,"bart, you were right."
48186,Lisa,sideshow bob!
44601,Lisa,i want some fried sugar!
52115,Lisa,is too.
47074,Lisa,"okay, jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
48844,Lisa,what do we do now?
43489,Lisa,that's it. i can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. i am out of here.
44750,Lisa,let's just pray this hits the prison.
46251,Lisa,that's terrible!
46277,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
45440,Lisa,"look mom, the safety instructions are written in haiku. ""fasten seatbelts tight / your seat cushions float gently / headsets five dollars."""
43070,Lisa,no.
41611,Lisa,quick! quick! everyone into my dream!
46286,Lisa,"hey, stop! wait! oh, any day but science project day!"
43028,Lisa,"if you search her room, i am certain you will find the money."
43682,Lisa,miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up. she called me a p.c. thug.
51265,Lisa,a word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced.
44717,Lisa,quit it... quit it... quit... you kids knock it off! mama's watchin' her stories!
42825,Lisa,"dad, that's just a plant."
49673,Lisa,did you girls make miss hoover sick?
50431,Lisa,maggie's locked in!
47755,Lisa,"i'm sure you did. but still, don't you ever wonder what might have happened if things had gone differently?"
50544,Lisa,you're t.r. francis! you wrote the angelica button books! they're my favorite fantasy novels!
50144,Lisa,"uh, dad? they turned you into a vampire."
47391,Lisa,we're not paramedics!
49497,Lisa,"sorry we missed your special day, grampa. we'll definitely go next year."
43907,Lisa,uh huh.
50509,Lisa,"wow! while i was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
47387,Lisa,i'm gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.
52003,Lisa,valhalla is where vikings go when they die.
47344,Lisa,"i think that's ""drop."""
50515,Lisa,fun dad rocks!
51611,Lisa,fourth of july fireworks were a different story. they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know.
44881,Lisa,hurry! hurry! lower the bridge!
43232,Lisa,"hey, i remember you. mayor quimby, right?"
50912,Lisa,it's not the vegetarianism!
47842,Lisa,what happened to the glacier? it's nearly melted. this must be due to global warming!
44855,Lisa,may i sit there?
50545,Lisa,but why are you working at a dinosaur show? and why did you run away from me? and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest? and--
50378,Lisa,"oh, you think i'm pretty?"
44200,Lisa,"bart, that's coffee ice cream! it has caffeine in it!"
44634,Lisa,"hey, martin seconded the motion. it's entirely his fault."
42457,Lisa,why?
47220,Lisa,"oh, definitely. if you ask me, she's far less dangerous than bart."
42807,Lisa,"maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
43596,Lisa,bedbugs?
46889,Lisa,huh?
51957,Lisa,"no, maggie! come here, girl. come to me."
46841,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
44885,Lisa,"i should have known i wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but i really wanted to see that exhibit. i'll never take another stupid risk like that again!"
44743,Lisa,so i'm not doomed!
52348,Lisa,and they're not shy about expressing it.
44347,Lisa,when do you expect the ringing will stop?!
43851,Lisa,"mr. estes, the publications advisor. i edited the whole thing."
48605,Lisa,tomorrow's multicultural day at school.
47139,Lisa,... so i sent luke's sister down the wrong trail and... hey! where'd all this water come from? there used to be a trail here! and there used to be a beaver dam there.
50926,Lisa,you don't feel any pain.
50675,Lisa,the boy i like is hemingway-esque!
50634,Lisa,okay.
48460,Lisa,that might work.
47470,Lisa,"okay, okay, don't get discouraged. every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like."
44752,Lisa,"but surely, i deserve some credit for..."
50802,Lisa,"well, it worked once."
46869,Lisa,hey kozlov! aim for the five hole! he's got an opening the size of red square.
45981,Lisa,i'd like to visit a prisoner.
50625,Lisa,"like all too many stories about my family, it began with somebody watching television."
51410,Lisa,"well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
50010,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
43487,Lisa,"bart, tell dad i'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
48669,Lisa,we did it! now we can enjoy boxingham palace in peace!
45799,Lisa,what about me?
50414,Lisa,"okay. first of all, it's never wise to use the word ""spew"" in a love song."
49160,Lisa,"um, there's someone i forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. krusty, will you come up on stage, please?"
49118,Lisa,professor.
46552,Lisa,"""springfield preparatory school?!"" dad, you told me there were no private schools in springfield!"
47708,Lisa,i know! it's such an unrealistic standard for young... huh?
48765,Lisa,so true.
48205,Lisa,cyrus? you never mentioned him before.
49279,Lisa,"i can't afford any of your products, but can i buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think i have a mypod?"
48250,Lisa,now you have a friend.
43652,Lisa,you gotta hand it to krusty.
51078,Lisa,she hates me because i'm pretty!
47840,Lisa,sure am!
52318,Lisa,i just want to call attention to the fact that i'm not watching this fight. it's my form of non-violent protest.
50917,Lisa,really?
51225,Lisa,"'twas halloween night, with the kids door-to-dooring, and all over town blood sugar was soaring."
45161,Lisa,i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
42319,Lisa,we feel neither highs nor lows.
46554,Lisa,their periodic table has two hundred and fifty elements!
45816,Lisa,"dad, help!"
42901,Lisa,oh who am i kidding? there's no way i'm ever gonna beat allison!
52413,Lisa,lisa simpson.
51275,Lisa,i can't believe he pays you so little. the crowd was crazy about you.
44298,Lisa,no.
50806,Lisa,i denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! and i denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
42736,Lisa,really?
47323,Lisa,it's gone!
48444,Lisa,"hey bart, you wanna jam with me?"
50848,Lisa,but we're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.
49539,Lisa,"dad, i've got the perfect thing."
47487,Lisa,"oh, i'm tired, i'm hungry, red plastic sandals are not great running-away shoes..."
42291,Lisa,old man winter!
48266,Lisa,and of course you'd never attack a fellow herbivore!
46129,Lisa,"i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all in your head."
44109,Lisa,bart!
42806,Lisa,"so bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?"
51069,Lisa,can i ask you guys something? why does someone become a bully?
50481,Lisa,what?! i'm telling mom!
42243,Lisa,"dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
52321,Lisa,"we're really proud of you, dad."
42501,Lisa,"oh, good idea! let's see... bass, bass... ""tiny tim""... ""the chipmunks greatest hits""... ""a castrato christmas""..."
44683,Lisa,i'll get it in a second. don't worry.
44489,Lisa,fully. we have to go now.
43401,Lisa,dedicated educator principal seymour skinner. his school lost millions when burns pirated its oil well; and grounds-tender groundskeeper willie. he lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
50131,Lisa,"well, my latin's a little rusty, but i think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game."
46798,Lisa,"and you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the olive garden."
51597,Lisa,"but when i grow up, i'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever. and i'll always love you."
43853,Lisa,wha?
46828,Lisa,"bart, i am so mad at you!"
51772,Lisa,"look, dad had to get cured some time. there's nothing we can do about it."
51429,Lisa,"pass the peas, please."
45742,Lisa,i'm trying! can't i get on your shoulders?
48520,Lisa,i'm not here.
48087,Lisa,where am i?
51055,Lisa,the joeys go in feet first!
51380,Lisa,professor digglesby's wand! now i have every wizarding stick from the spells and potions department of wagglepoofs academy!
48021,Lisa,oh boy! this is what sunny sunday afternoons are for!
51572,Lisa,can i make an observation?
48571,Lisa,"mom, i understand your psychological need, but i'm not sure what you can do."
49144,Lisa,yo ho ho and a bottle of fun!
46985,Lisa,wow. i'd better make the most of this.
48635,Lisa,am i to understand you're purposely denying education to these children?
45213,Lisa,max power??
50661,Lisa,your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable.
52046,Lisa,and the main export is furious political thought.
46637,Lisa,"when i sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video."
42155,Lisa,peek-a-boo!
44404,Lisa,ralph and i could do the report together.
52216,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
47746,Lisa,oh! that'd be wonderful! oh i'd -- i'd have to ask my mom.
42101,Lisa,it's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
52082,Lisa,we got money!
50146,Lisa,didn't there used to be more texxon stations?
43241,Lisa,how did you get that gash on your forehead?
45658,Lisa,"ohh, i don't like the looks of this."
51954,Lisa,is not.
50516,Lisa,yay! / x-games! x-games! / alright!
45740,Lisa,the door!
49012,Lisa,"no, stop buying me leg warmers! i'm already wearing six pairs!"
49545,Lisa,"baked potato, side salad and a--"
49433,Lisa,"hm, i wonder if it's theses."
46987,Lisa,"this is just a kickball with ""mars"" written on it."
41736,Lisa,i stand corrected.
50645,Lisa,hit refresh.
46993,Lisa,"except when pronounced like ""a,"" as in ""neighbor"" and ""weigh."""
51776,Lisa,"or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild."
51797,Lisa,you've got a gift!
43826,Lisa,perfect. let's roll.
44888,Lisa,dad! you're headed for the river again!
50534,Lisa,"yeah-huh: athos, porthos, aramis and d'artagnan."
48502,Lisa,"well, you'd better hurry. i don't think dad can last much longer where he's hiding."
44397,Lisa,"mom, are those rabbits dead?"
42371,Lisa,happy valentine's.
50338,Lisa,initiate phase two.
52268,Lisa,i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is.
43156,Lisa,yay! i won your stupid bathroom products race!
44208,Lisa,what? i didn't order any giant sub!
51809,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
45784,Lisa,"whoa, whoa, whoa! why don't we just invite our creditor nations here, and gently remind them of america's past generosity?"
41929,Lisa,"giddyup, dad."
49660,Lisa,this is the best hiding place. they'll never find me.
47710,Lisa,noooooo!
44786,Lisa,"between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb."
46969,Lisa,"good point, dad. what would jesus do?"
45465,Lisa,bart! bart! krusty just fired his associate producer!
46648,Lisa,hey! hey!
46513,Lisa,could this be the end of our series... of events?
42034,Lisa,"don't even bother with the raisins. i'm not gonna eat 'em... double bologna! double bologna!... i don't ask for much, just no pimento. don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause i can hardly..."
47366,Lisa,there's the enemy. give 'em all you got.
44967,Lisa,"what's ""d.m.y.""?"
47233,Lisa,"nelson, you're running for president?"
50249,Lisa,"o tannenbaum, o tannenbaum..."
45302,Lisa,"i'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""the slaughterhouse."" it's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood."
49306,Lisa,"actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. they only attack to defend their hive."
47671,Lisa,i couldn't be prouder.
45947,Lisa,"that says ""corn,"" bart."
47645,Lisa,chief is fine.
51580,Lisa,the vintage record store?
44938,Lisa,alex! over here! okay if the new girl sits with us?
52022,Lisa,mm! delicioso!
51281,Lisa,"how? by size, brand, value? and don't even suggest race, 'cause i don't see that. i just see little people i own. what do you say, ladies?"
47202,Lisa,is there a problem with your father?
42860,Lisa,fine. i'll play outside.
48863,Lisa,look at all these alternative comic book creators...
43281,Lisa,who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
51524,Lisa,"in the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. he made me a better person, because that's what heroes do."
46878,Lisa,"with all this hard work, i'm too tired to worry about the world. and soon i will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!"
46618,Lisa,"uh, god says we should just be friends."
43127,Lisa,fine.
41846,Lisa,maybe you ate a clove.
46150,Lisa,"no, something else..."
44468,Lisa,this bed is making me nauseous. why won't it stop?!
50452,Lisa,"hi, my name is lisa simpson."
46561,Lisa,"bratwurst, sauerbraten, donderblitzen... mom, isn't there anything vegetarian?"
48146,Lisa,"ah, mortadella!"
48673,Lisa,"it's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. so i made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation."
50797,Lisa,this is where i live.
43615,Lisa,we are not wieners!
46537,Lisa,"we were playing four square, and i called no double taps, and ralph double taps. and i said ""you're out"". and he says ""i can do a sum-ber-salt"" which has nothing to do with anything."
49027,Lisa,dad... dad? wake up!
43943,Lisa,"bart, noooo!"
51205,Lisa,"but, but--"
45298,Lisa,"pretty cool. but now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?"
43642,Lisa,"you look nice, is all."
48477,Lisa,do you have an idea?
47609,Lisa,"oh, please let it be volvo."
49273,Lisa,i didn't?!
50273,Lisa,fine. just get in here.
45980,Lisa,shut up!
49201,Lisa,they're worse than wal-king!
47984,Lisa,daddy told me to be brave
43095,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
43825,Lisa,"da-ad! you're not pointing anywhere near springfield. it's over here, apu."
45434,Lisa,"um, according to the mexican council of food, this expired two years ago."
51140,Lisa,"mom, i found your wedding dress!"
52265,Lisa,"excuse me, mr. hutz. are you a shyster?"
45606,Lisa,ho-ly night...
46978,Lisa,"skewed tour? the traveling festival of rock 'n' roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?"
43185,Lisa,this is horrible. people will start to avoid springfield.
50837,Lisa,fievel was a mouse in a movie.
48028,Lisa,"well, at least your name's on the bowl."
49856,Lisa,anytime.
50785,Lisa,forgive a fool her tears.
48511,Lisa,"moe, these fragments are fascinating. ""i was in the christmas pageant once. mom showed up with a new boyfriend. he called me steve."""
50165,Lisa,what kind of kiss did you get?
42280,Lisa,daad!
49887,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! i'll never get that image out of my head!
46636,Lisa,"well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. and you can't hang up on a nun."
51022,Lisa,"well, milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. but it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway."
49153,Lisa,"yeah, sure, mel. let me just wave one more goodbye to my fans."
48814,Lisa,i don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
44898,Lisa,"oh! we can't touch it, dad. it's behind a velvet rope! a velvet rope."
45162,Lisa,"dad, we hit don rickles!"
51089,Lisa,she sustained me!
47816,Lisa,hmm... the tv changes channels every time the dog barks.
51246,Lisa,i won the science fair! i get to go to chicago!
47476,Lisa,you're making fun of him for something you made him do.
46187,Lisa,"well, lots of people like jazz fusion..."
42048,Lisa,she's beautiful!
43061,Lisa,"great game, bart."
47335,Lisa,"krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a bar mitzvah?"
46108,Lisa,i'm gonna wear my apron on the fourth of july.
49255,Lisa,what's goin' on?
45491,Lisa,"and there's the cane from ""citizen kane."" wait a minute. there was no cane in ""citizen kane."""
42402,Lisa,uh... ralph?
42745,Lisa,"come on, dad, you can make it."
42550,Lisa,we know you're the one behind this. so knock it off or we're going to the cops.
45374,Lisa,"yeah, if you want to change your image, you've got to get your face out there..."
51915,Lisa,"dad, i get good grades 'cause i'm smart and i pay attention and i study hard."
42206,Lisa,oh my god. i'm ugly.
42386,Lisa,"tickets to the krusty anniversary show! oh, he must want me to go with him."
47158,Lisa,why does a dog have human girlfriends?
49958,Lisa,again with the blonde! why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within?
44061,Lisa,"okay, start with diagonal colors."
43602,Lisa,"we'll be safe here till mom and dad, the evil overlords gets home."
45918,Lisa,ow! son of a...
43814,Lisa,it's just a stupid rock.
45952,Lisa,if you ask me...
50925,Lisa,"get along, little buggies!"
42763,Lisa,"no, dad. he's grooming him."
48799,Lisa,"good luck on your first day, dad."
48534,Lisa,how can we forget? mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
44484,Lisa,aren't there any good bachelors in this town?
47709,Lisa,"hey, i don't look so bad."
43669,Lisa,"the secret confessions of jebediah springfield? ""know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""
44096,Lisa,"mom, dad and mr. burns could be trapped in there!"
50251,Lisa,"nein auch im winter, wenn es schneit..."
52055,Lisa,he brought us gifts. his first unselfish act.
43701,Lisa,"oh, dad, i'm really sorry. i know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
44747,Lisa,what a whimsical building! who says science can't be fun?
51769,Lisa,not right now.
44228,Lisa,"no! as your babysitter, i order you to stop hitting your head on the wall!"
51137,Lisa,"i'm sorry your dress is gone, mom."
45303,Lisa,"the worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you!"
51661,Lisa,"well, i guess you and i are in charge now, bart. but if we split the chores, i'm sure we can... what are you doing?!"
51765,Lisa,i just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken.
50784,Lisa,dutch?
43929,Lisa,"ooo, waffles!"
51195,Lisa,don't you think it's weird that dad stopped eating pork and drinking beer?
52490,Lisa,"actually, terrence, this is a synthetic substance. devised for zombie vegans, or ""zegans."""
46228,Lisa,i'd like to thank her parents for helping with the caging.
50318,Lisa,it happened to the scorpions too! the flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping.
41955,Lisa,ariel.
49334,Lisa,see ya!
46589,Lisa,"look grampa, you're already getting a new neighbor."
42542,Lisa,the fox network has sunk to a new low.
42381,Lisa,good.
51807,Lisa,"hashtag ""springfield pride"" has never ever trend-ed."
48944,Lisa,forget it.
50021,Lisa,"no! i fell in love with theater, dance, and song!"
49185,Lisa,"well, i could tell mom and dad the chip is in the bird and hope they take me to machu picchu another time, or..."
42577,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong?"
49329,Lisa,you're older. why don't you do these fun activities?
45401,Lisa,oh. what do you produce?
44508,Lisa,"look, there's more. what the heck is this thing?"
42191,Lisa,"hey, mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
52212,Lisa,here.
51185,Lisa,three kids with no money but plenty of love!
47163,Lisa,"mom, we need him for our plan."
50894,Lisa,please? thank you.
43675,Lisa,jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld. his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight!
51471,Lisa,please.
49800,Lisa,"this entry's dated april 14th, 1860."
48590,Lisa,uh... deux... troi....
51606,Lisa,bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
43910,Lisa,me.
49813,Lisa,"well i am reading it, and when i'm finished, i'm going to use eliza's diary for my ""black history month"" presentation!"
51371,Lisa,that sermon really inspired me. this whole christmas has been about money...
51520,Lisa,he's my dad.
47575,Lisa,when you grow up i'll be outside.
49802,Lisa,"""...because tomorrow, i shall get my very first slave."""
49889,Lisa,"quick, we've got to get them back!"
52252,Lisa,but captain murdock!
51146,Lisa,"all the greats are here -- jellyroll jones, boston cream basie, birthmark billy jackson, grabass walker, the fatneck sisters, and... bleeding gums murphy?!"
43412,Lisa,and we don't even know whose gun that was. maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad.
44412,Lisa,"look, bart. i have to practice my saxophone and you can't stop me."
48565,Lisa,it's christmas! it's christmas! it's christmas!
49609,Lisa,no one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.
51660,Lisa,shut up!
45624,Lisa,"hey, mom!"
43956,Lisa,oh! the whole forest is blooming!
50962,Lisa,but i wanna know about dad and his broken heart.
42690,Lisa,they made dad sicky-mart.
49684,Lisa,they're not evil! they believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like i belonged.
45876,Lisa,"forget it, dad. i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby."
49113,Lisa,are you guys still mad at me?
43377,Lisa,i'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. we've got a really great instructor lined up...
46810,Lisa,"okay, the sun rises in the east, so the rooster would probably want to lay it on the cool side..."
46482,Lisa,no!
46099,Lisa,"dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. in fact, i made a graph."
43252,Lisa,well?
49860,Lisa,"no it's not, dream-hoover! and as long as i'm asleep, i'm gonna have some fun. i can fly! wheeee!"
46881,Lisa,when you put your t-shirt on backwards?
52384,Lisa,discount lion safari!
49586,Lisa,"you know, i think those shirts should say ""insecurity."""
46995,Lisa,yeah. i've got some work to do.
46475,Lisa,"i'm planting my own bodhi tree. if i meditate under it, perhaps i can find inner peace."
47808,Lisa,"well, if hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport."
50626,Lisa,"hm, i kinda want to create my own thing. do you sell any just plain sets?"
49901,Lisa,"no... i am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy."
50621,Lisa,"dad, no!"
43276,Lisa,nooooooo!
51549,Lisa,maybe this isn't the sport for you.
44688,Lisa,"for your information, none of your business!"
45141,Lisa,that's one grade i truly earned.
44991,Lisa,"ah, it's gonna be a long night."
47047,Lisa,"oh, that's easy. first it's introduced, then it goes to committee, then..."
48341,Lisa,"okay, the engine room is just through this flooded area. somebody has to take the rope, swim through to the other side, and tie it off so we can use it as an underwater guide line."
43193,Lisa,that is what i'd truly like to be/ 'cause if i were an oscar meyer weiner...
48569,Lisa,back to scottsdale.
48323,Lisa,oh yeah? what's mom's birthday?
50093,Lisa,i mean the point guard.
51631,Lisa,"i know, but they're not gonna waste a whole saturday inside."
44244,Lisa,"oh, what's happening? where am i?"
46198,Lisa,wow. there's so much i don't understand about bullying.
41877,Lisa,i didn't select this costume for mobility. i wore it to salute the noble native american of the pacific northwests...
43510,Lisa,"i still stand by my beliefs, but i can't defend what i did. i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue."
52218,Lisa,"it's the centerpiece, bart!"
49200,Lisa,"mom, you said all hitchhikers were drug-crazed thrill seekers."
47554,Lisa,"no it doesn't! this movie is drivel! she's wooden and unpleasant, and no matter what he does, he's still ryan o'neal."
50468,Lisa,skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
48426,Lisa,"isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? they're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now."
50838,Lisa,can't dad take bart while we seek out culture?
47590,Lisa,you're not mild-mannered. you're often liquored-up and rude.
48592,Lisa,papa meaux! papa meaux!
45943,Lisa,"oh, no. you poor thing. here..."
49864,Lisa,i'm just advanced! you can catch up!
43020,Lisa,"bart, be strong. you don't need that little hell cat."
49060,Lisa,"well, your friend mary from 4-h lives on a farm -- lou can stay with her!"
49420,Lisa,this test penalizes guessing.
43350,Lisa,what if i could find it?
49503,Lisa,"""at mcellis island, returning immigrants who are sick of america are processed by irish authorities."""
44432,Lisa,that's not gonna protect us from anything.
42365,Lisa,"oh, c'mon! hurry!"
49882,Lisa,fine.
46237,Lisa,we need these because we have... to...
44386,Lisa,"dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!"
42214,Lisa,what are you talking about?
42451,Lisa,arrrgh!
50066,Lisa,"well, clearly, you're an exception."
46501,Lisa,"mom, that's not how you pry them apart."
51223,Lisa,you weren't shot!
49725,Lisa,"larry, please don't judge our whole family by bart. he's the black sheep. not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. i do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. ooh, look! jazz!"
49546,Lisa,is this seat taken?
43958,Lisa,"oh, my eyes are burning!"
44921,Lisa,this should be in a museum.
45494,Lisa,but what if someone bad tells me to...
41721,Lisa,"half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
47469,Lisa,"uh, well i..."
49646,Lisa,"it was an accident, i swear!"
48920,Lisa,we're in every kind of therapy!
48745,Lisa,"what's the matter, bart?"
52019,Lisa,then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
48058,Lisa,thanks for making me feel better.
42604,Lisa,"lu, lu, lu / lu lu lu lu lu / lu lu lu lu lu lu lu"
47238,Lisa,"... and we deserve a french teacher who actually speaks french. j'accuse, monsieur kupferberg!"
47778,Lisa,i bet you could find a distributor at the springfield novelty expo.
44777,Lisa,"thank you. our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. first on the chopping block, periodicals."
41718,Lisa,"bart, grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
42342,Lisa,yayyy!
44303,Lisa,you have to cut these six-pack holders up. otherwise fish get trapped in them.
49796,Lisa,bicentennial issue of reader's digest...
42323,Lisa,"mom, this is fascinating. did you know that they'll stop dad's heart for six whole minutes?"
44444,Lisa,i can't hear you. wait! fly into my saxophone!
43460,Lisa,awwww.
44130,Lisa,do you think we'll ever see her again?
48487,Lisa,i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world.
43035,Lisa,you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
42685,Lisa,i can see through time.
49741,Lisa,me! me! me! me! me!
45122,Lisa,can't you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?
47492,Lisa,"mom, dad! i'm so sorry i got you into this!"
50331,Lisa,"wow! i know i lay down in front of bulldozers to stop this stadium from being built, but i have to admit, it's pretty sweet."
46388,Lisa,where's bart? his mountain dew's getting flat.
47052,Lisa,me too. the walls are paper-thin.
45082,Lisa,lobsters need salt water.
49305,Lisa,"it's not for long. but until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees."
52146,Lisa,"it's called, ""the raven."""
44648,Lisa,milhouse! i am defending you!
45905,Lisa,"we were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash."
51590,Lisa,"mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend?!"
44806,Lisa,"oh, bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time..."
50255,Lisa,okay.
43432,Lisa,"i thought i could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
48496,Lisa,what is everyone doing?
47295,Lisa,"look, it's j.k. rowling, author of the harry potter books. you've turned a generation of kids onto reading."
48573,Lisa,"dad, there aren't any places left to sit."
42964,Lisa,"yeah, best ever."
49541,Lisa,tofu cubes... tidy joes... chili con cottage cheese...
52183,Lisa,"hi, ralph."
51358,Lisa,they find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.
44810,Lisa,"nelson, cover for me."
43130,Lisa,i hope it's a girl.
43978,Lisa,yes i do! sure i do! look!
51822,Lisa,"wow, dad! thank you!"
45065,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. anyway, you promised to take us to the lake."
49379,Lisa,"yes! i mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! green ones, chinese ones, chubby bald ones..."
49682,Lisa,"zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! i curse you, hell's kitten!"
46780,Lisa,if only poor william bonney were here to see his dream come true.
42124,Lisa,i could've been the flower girl. and i wouldn't keep falling down either.
50424,Lisa,who'd follow milhouse around like that? sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko.
51679,Lisa,probably just another piece of america's space junk falling out of orbit.
45169,Lisa,"wow, you look really hungover, dad. what did you do last night?"
46495,Lisa,"we've got star wars monopoly, rasta-mon-opoly, galip-olopoly... edna krabappoly..."
50538,Lisa,"no fair! this isn't big, it's medium!"
41784,Lisa,"okay, america. inspire me."
50313,Lisa,"it's okay, grampa -- you don't have to act grumpy. i know you're taking the drug, and i don't mind -- because you're happy."
42061,Lisa,"""okay, okay... i cannot see you for the next five years, for i will be farming the ocean floor."""
45329,Lisa,it's the rapture. and i never knew true love.
52197,Lisa,it is time.
52067,Lisa,you do? why?
52485,Lisa,argh.
43631,Lisa,"mom, look! i found something more fun than complaining!"
51895,Lisa,what are they doing?
48805,Lisa,"bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house."
45737,Lisa,"those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. and if bart gets a wowwipop, i want a wowwipop."
48353,Lisa,principal skinner?
47572,Lisa,"yeah, i can't sleep. maybe we should give mom and dad a break. you know, go spend the day in an amusement park so we're out of their hair."
41825,Lisa,you change it.
45589,Lisa,get down. security guard.
45671,Lisa,"well, dad and bart ran away and no one seems to know where they went."
44523,Lisa,"oh, thank you so much! uhm... you know i can't afford to pay you."
51226,Lisa,but the simpson abode was deep down in the dumps. 'cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps.
49421,Lisa,"well, that's it."
47371,Lisa,"all right, i'll look."
46218,Lisa,shh. it's working. look.
48843,Lisa,i can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad.
46578,Lisa,"gee buck, your old films are as violent as today's!"
50466,Lisa,that's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
50372,Lisa,there's no chance whatsoever. i'll show you.
50158,Lisa,no! that's not gonna happen to me! i'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!
45899,Lisa,it was amazing how fast dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.
49095,Lisa,i can't believe i'm a director with a movie at sundance.
44859,Lisa,"um... excuse me, sir. when does this bus get to the museum?"
42394,Lisa,that story isn't suitable for children.
45339,Lisa,"oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the california highway..."
52026,Lisa,"bart, i read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. they go through eight separate stages. right now, i'm in stage three, fear. you're in stage two, denial."
49102,Lisa,"oh, i was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life."
48781,Lisa,"you're going to the dentist too, dad."
49804,Lisa,"""saturday, april 14, 1860. dear diary, i must be brief, for tonight is the grand ball..."""
43691,Lisa,"you don't have to help me with this, dad."
49712,Lisa,"never, huh? what are you gonna eat?"
49544,Lisa,"um, do you mind if i join you?"
51539,Lisa,are you okay?
49708,Lisa,"bart, you have to take him back!"
42858,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
42783,Lisa,"hey mom, bart's throwing peas."
48485,Lisa,"whatever, i've got some paper to mâché."
51695,Lisa,"they're evolving! wow. that's a first for you, bart."
46052,Lisa,"dad, i'll set up your computer. why don't you and bart go play in the back yard?"
45558,Lisa,how can he rebel? he doesn't even know where he is.
43809,Lisa,"wow, he's even more agitated than usual. maybe we should let him stay."
43588,Lisa,"when bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. and what makes your voice high?"
46038,Lisa,"oh dad, you have to stop."
44466,Lisa,and so is the bible!
43957,Lisa,excuse me.
48633,Lisa,excuse me.
47890,Lisa,"neat! when i sleep at dad's, i call this bed."
51234,Lisa,"actually, there's a little more."
46898,Lisa,"so many categories... gym teacher of the year, substitute teacher of the year, most wheelchair-accessible school award?"
41873,Lisa,not quite. i got some dynamite stuff from rabbi simon ben eleazar.
51424,Lisa,that doesn't sound like you.
41632,Lisa,poor predictable bart. always takes rock.
50202,Lisa,"a little tired of revenge, are we?"
49343,Lisa,does it get you into special exhibits?
45552,Lisa,"dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside."
47638,Lisa,tomorrow's? i hadn't thought about publishing more.
48252,Lisa,"i think this is the perfect job for the new you, willie. it requires sophistication, tact, and you get to meet the highest class of people."
42687,Lisa,bye!
51515,Lisa,near tears.
42840,Lisa,"oh, look. bart's all alone. maybe i should keep him company, at least for a little while."
42143,Lisa,this award is the biggest farce i ever saw.
47016,Lisa,"well, i suppose i could just skip college and marry milhouse..."
45541,Lisa,maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
45518,Lisa,"you did fix them, right dad? because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world."
42711,Lisa,mom! we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person!
42975,Lisa,uncle mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have!
41646,Lisa,"ohh, it's a ball of yarn. that's funny, i feel like batting it around."
42701,Lisa,"hey, horse-face! git yer ugly pie-hooks off that summer fun set!"
45334,Lisa,"well, if it'll help - um, mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy."
51121,Lisa,"milhouse, seeing you there... saying nothing... it's the cutest you've ever been."
43886,Lisa,"that's my dorky little brother, bart --tholomew."
48829,Lisa,"to be fair, the millennium just started, so it's not that big a deal... but they're giving it to me!"
52018,Lisa,"does, too."
43165,Lisa,"office of the solicitor general? ""office of the prime minister?"" ""hopping mad collection agency?"" what is all this stuff?"
41888,Lisa,i wish for world peace.
44603,Lisa,that was just confusing.
49480,Lisa,...lisa?
42224,Lisa,isn't this dangerous?
46447,Lisa,i am not gonna be taken in by all of this.
47456,Lisa,"oh my god, you're not just smart... you're brilliant! mom!"
44216,Lisa,b-e-d -- bed!
42645,Lisa,maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her. we could go down to the casino and let her know.
42586,Lisa,you're probably right. let's just go back...
49461,Lisa,"hmm, what if i read every other word? ""one more time, you're hopeless. try again, numb skull."" that's not very nice -- i will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""turn around. seek springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
45636,Lisa,those boys of mine.
46292,Lisa,west springfield?
50659,Lisa,"even a kid who wears a ""finding nemo"" back brace has some pride. you went too far this time, bart."
46986,Lisa,free tibet!
47760,Lisa,"mom, your hair."
45935,Lisa,"father, i knew you'd rescue us!"
50354,Lisa,hm.
44583,Lisa,he's dreamy.
45926,Lisa,i wonder where goldilocks was.
42643,Lisa,do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? i mean we haven't had a meal with mom all week. and she hasn't even started my costume for the geography pageant.
41841,Lisa,"bart, that's so sweet. may i see the card?"
46964,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
46959,Lisa,"thank you, mr. cronkite."
52422,Lisa,i can't.
48515,Lisa,philistines.
47488,Lisa,air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and i'll never run into my family here! it's the perfect place to start a new life.
43363,Lisa,one more time!
44947,Lisa,"hey, wait up!"
47068,Lisa,"that's it! lisa simpson, astronomer!"
43310,Lisa,there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now. at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar.
46194,Lisa,knock-knock...
41681,Lisa,that's assault! that is assault.
44576,Lisa,"but we don't have $15,000."
47096,Lisa,"oh, a jigsaw puzzle..."
42885,Lisa,"ah, that used to be my face in the mud..."
43633,Lisa,"mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons i like horses better than cars? one: a horse never--"
51716,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't be jealous of apu. remember, it's all about the music."
43279,Lisa,"mom, don't give the puppies to him! he'll be mean to them!"
52305,Lisa,"dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
42311,Lisa,homer.
47292,Lisa,"grampa, that's so romantic! we gotta go to england!"
46119,Lisa,uh-oh. dad's having an antacid trip.
45763,Lisa,"hey, that's my helicopter!"
49957,Lisa,how many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
46787,Lisa,but man's inquisitive nature is what separates us from the animals.
41895,Lisa,can we sleep with you?
49429,Lisa,"for he's a fabulous flanders, which nobody can deny!"
44102,Lisa,"well, it's blue... six feet long..."
47936,Lisa,i'm sure everyone's happier with santa's little helper here to love them.
44285,Lisa,but nature's not our enemy.
52350,Lisa,"bye, unky herb."
45015,Lisa,"they're on hinges. that's really ingenious, dad."
46438,Lisa,yes.
46082,Lisa,they made an elephant!
46543,Lisa,i thought you liked the new dad.
49128,Lisa,"you know, spiritually speaking, grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... so, in a way... uh... i'm lying down now."
42939,Lisa,"soon, corey, soon."
42730,Lisa,make sure you get my mom's hair just right.
49627,Lisa,"listen, you're a persistent fellow, but i--"
47831,Lisa,i hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
46434,Lisa,we're investigating a possible murder case.
52114,Lisa,"... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, ""we have traced the call. it's coming from the floor below you. get out of the house!"" but it was too late. end of story."
52480,Lisa,"and i'm going to take a page out of your playbook, and let it slide!"
50156,Lisa,"well, um, i was looking through mom's old schoolwork, and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
43059,Lisa,hi mom! over here! mom!
46499,Lisa,"bart, you're cheating!"
46398,Lisa,"hunting? dad, no!"
42848,Lisa,"look, it's the telescope i won at the optics festival."
45365,Lisa,jack lalanne!
51143,Lisa,"you never know, mom. i'm only eight. i might get married someday... even if it's only a green card marriage to keep a chinese dissident from being deported."
50985,Lisa,they're miserable.
46830,Lisa,wait! wait!
45233,Lisa,no!
41908,Lisa,no. i didn't.
51959,Lisa,"all right maggie, just go to bart."
44394,Lisa,"here's a better idea -- you give me your address, and i'll write to you."
48344,Lisa,"yeah, one for boys and one for girls."
44059,Lisa,"yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the hall of records was mysteriously blown away!"
47209,Lisa,"no -- your son! on the biggest day of his life, when he accepts the nobel prize, you're not gonna be there."
49184,Lisa,"ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. you've been flying south, because you're migrating to... machu picchu, peru!"
48734,Lisa,he is stealing!
44282,Lisa,dad! you're not supposed to have fun recycling. this is serious.
52126,Lisa,"sorry... sorry bart. sorry, mom... sorry maggie... sorry lisa."
50473,Lisa,"actually, i do have a speech prepared!"
46704,Lisa,i'm more than okay!...
49103,Lisa,"guys, guys! look, it's a documentary -- nobody outside of this festival is ever gonna hear about it."
49973,Lisa,dad! that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
50530,Lisa,people are loving our list of springfield's top ninety-nine afghan restaurants.
44984,Lisa,"thanks, mom. but i told you, i'm not going."
48299,Lisa,i already saw that exact same show on another network.
52180,Lisa,"i know. it's times like this that i'm thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do. bart, i think i can help you."
42869,Lisa,the sax.
47466,Lisa,time to show them the new me. no one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.
43294,Lisa,"no, don't! stay down, monty! don't get up! stay down! stay down, boy!"
41677,Lisa,"aw, he's sweet. what am i doing? he's just ralph with a dream. the dream of not ralphing. but i'm sure i could totally change and fix him."
51740,Lisa,are we there yet?
44195,Lisa,certainly.
50007,Lisa,do you guys always do that?
42108,Lisa,here santa's little helper!
41983,Lisa,fifty big ones?
45438,Lisa,never mind. looks like the flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
52221,Lisa,baaart! you're wrecking it! let go! i worked forever on this!
49006,Lisa,nothing like fresh air.
44239,Lisa,"um, excuse me, mr. smithers, bart may be seriously hurt. could we possibly go ahead of you?"
42499,Lisa,"dad please, for the last time, i beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob."
45732,Lisa,"oh, no!"
52315,Lisa,"thank you, reverend lovejoy."
46227,Lisa,"this is my test subject, francine."
49217,Lisa,not anymore!
52193,Lisa,"bart, i have a riddle for you: what's the sound of one hand clapping?"
52097,Lisa,i'm calling to report the babysitter bandit. she's in our house right --
46706,Lisa,"oh, thank you!"
48619,Lisa,"yes, we're among the lostest."
42599,Lisa,grampa's a vampire?!
45770,Lisa,"if i'm gonna bail the country out... i'll have to raise taxes. but in my speech, i'd like to avoid calling it a ""painful emergency tax."""
52465,Lisa,that's the answer! maggie's a real witch now! she can reverse the spell!
50967,Lisa,what does that mean?
42827,Lisa,"dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. there's a reason two people come together and stay together. there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. if you want to get mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can."
50121,Lisa,now get out there a kick a field goal! kidding!
42211,Lisa,i'm hideous.
44148,Lisa,hi-c! and fluffernutters!
49599,Lisa,...and doc...tor hibbert.
46646,Lisa,yes.
43911,Lisa,what's up there? / is it a monster? / we have to know! / what's the secret?
44126,Lisa,we've crushed her gentle spirit.
51987,Lisa,no.
45988,Lisa,wow. um... i started an organic compost pile at home.
41967,Lisa,bart!
43125,Lisa,"good aim, dad."
45537,Lisa,"all right. almost done, my little friend. soon you'll be a nice, cool... rat?!"
43383,Lisa,"""marge, bart, lisa, and maggie."" dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
50446,Lisa,"principal skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
49327,Lisa,to that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive!
47791,Lisa,it doesn't seem fair to the regular visitors.
45783,Lisa,we don't own the shores of tripoli.
45930,Lisa,you know she's only fattening you up so she can eat you.
41639,Lisa,scanning for sarcasm... it's clean. go!
49302,Lisa,bees.
45921,Lisa,face it -- they're not great parents.
41657,Lisa,these girls are brilliant! i finally found kids i can relate to.
49714,Lisa,"and, bart, maybe charlie can't be your little brother, but you'll always be a big brother to me."
51332,Lisa,fine. i gotta go.
44661,Lisa,"uh, that's right. the u.n. doesn't look too kindly on..."
46213,Lisa,"come on, people! move it! i want to see some sweat!"
47064,Lisa,i can find a good career at this museum. or at lease see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon i complained about.
48825,Lisa,"they come to your home to help you raise independent, self-actualized children. the counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."
49638,Lisa,that's it? just t.p. her?
42118,Lisa,i'm sorry?
50822,Lisa,"that's right, i'm lisa simpson, superstar!"
51893,Lisa,the sad truth is all families are like us.
50314,Lisa,"thanks, sweetie."
46882,Lisa,what about books?
47773,Lisa,"you're in big trouble, mister. i'm bleeding!"
41838,Lisa,i think this is something bart would really have enjoyed. but it's the only way he'll learn.
46157,Lisa,is that a navy tattoo?
50648,Lisa,that's not you.
46171,Lisa,yaaayy!
49053,Lisa,it's a no-brainer.
49154,Lisa,"oh no, the northern irish are also having a parade!"
44791,Lisa,"you didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony."
46821,Lisa,big fish! big fish!
43586,Lisa,"huh? hurry up, mom and dad are probably worried sick."
43713,Lisa,exactly.
46833,Lisa,"oh, forget it. hey, how do we get back?"
49105,Lisa,"oh... hi, mr. jarmusch."
52044,Lisa,"you know, in albania the unit of currency is called the lek."
48029,Lisa,the ones made from potatoes?
48537,Lisa,comic book guy! have you seen our mom?
51278,Lisa,"and some of the angles are loooooow. but don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions."
45504,Lisa,i still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
52352,Lisa,"i'll make it, mom. just tape my lunch box to my hand."
48206,Lisa,"that's quite a tale, grampa."
45404,Lisa,"my family never talks about library standards. and every time i try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd."
41981,Lisa,"all right, dolphins!"
51576,Lisa,are you guys okay?
48265,Lisa,"i've read about you. you're shy, and you rarely approach humans!"
51408,Lisa,these people hate my dad. how can they want to make a movie about him?
42281,Lisa,"oh, i get it. bart, the baby-sitter's here. let me tuck you in."
44452,Lisa,"stop! doesn't the bible say ""judge not lest ye be judged""?"
43275,Lisa,"mom, why do i have to wear a flea collar?"
45505,Lisa,we've got to go to the police.
49612,Lisa,"someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. this goes against every feminist bone in my body, but dad, can't you control your woman?"
41837,Lisa,i'm gonna eat eight pieces of chocolate.
44057,Lisa,"dad, wake up!"
46546,Lisa,"mom, did you sleep well at your sisters'?"
49512,Lisa,he ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!
49003,Lisa,how do you cope with it?
43736,Lisa,"yes, but..."
43471,Lisa,why does it talk like a lamb?
45603,Lisa,let ev-ry...
41626,Lisa,"dad, you just destroyed your first kiss."
49936,Lisa,huh?
52488,Lisa,what? no! it doesn't matter what i thought. i'm sorry i spied on you. but what i found is my daughter looks up to me!
50508,Lisa,"it wasn't a pie, it was science! and it's not fair -- my project was way better than bart's, and i didn't have help from a nerd! i'm my own nerd!"
43440,Lisa,"uh, actually, the... we were never baptized."
44691,Lisa,the project! i forgot all about it!
41911,Lisa,"dad, no!"
52292,Lisa,"dad, do something!"
41599,Lisa,what? i don't want to go to the same college as you.
41607,Lisa,time for a smoke.
41617,Lisa,"wait a minute, who killed maggie?"
51601,Lisa,"my brother is about to meet fear, and as usual, he won't pass."
51404,Lisa,"wait, i know one place in springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
44033,Lisa,about anything.
48139,Lisa,"oh, it had to be a boy, did it? you think a girl can't flip out? well, you're wrong!"
45871,Lisa,"oh, please stop!"
48289,Lisa,"no, no, it's still ""kid-napped."" the prefix applies to the victim."
42673,Lisa,"hush, field trip boy."
43167,Lisa,"i know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
48769,Lisa,"bart, are you all right? bart?"
50226,Lisa,it's amazing how i can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. i'm sure there's a german word for it.
44218,Lisa,i'll make you!
42470,Lisa,scratchy is getting a haircut. then itchy -- the barber -- chops scratchy's head off with a razor!
51529,Lisa,"i switched with her, dad."
43882,Lisa,didn't. it's lisa.
52329,Lisa,is too.
41644,Lisa,"oh, i know. i heard it too. here's some music."
41874,Lisa,"here you go, bart. it's a long shot, but, that's all i can do without learning ancient hebrew."
45407,Lisa,"well, for the first time in my life i feel that someone understands..."
46675,Lisa,"as head of the student activities committee, i have an idea."
44707,Lisa,time is running out.
43140,Lisa,"but, dad, don't you think..."
52281,Lisa,"please, dad...please"
51157,Lisa,"don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math."
42071,Lisa,"janey, school is never a waste of time."
45568,Lisa,"dad, there's a note on the back of your head."
47903,Lisa,we're going downhill... and i can't reach the brakes!
49056,Lisa,lisa's brother.
50359,Lisa,"raymondo! i mastered the slide pass -- and i've almost mastered the denver slide pass... and, why is there always a ""denver"" version of things?"
44080,Lisa,i think there must be a more logical explanation. and i think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
47208,Lisa,have you stopped to think about who you're hurting with this rampage?
47100,Lisa,he's working on a jigsaw puzzle.
42250,Lisa,it's not working.
44396,Lisa,"actually, i think we're in chinatown now."
43342,Lisa,"that's maggie again, grampa."
49016,Lisa,i need firsthand smoke!
49457,Lisa,"quaerite deum in corde et anima. that's latin... ""deum"" is god... and of course ""quaerite"" means ""seek""... ""seek god with heart and soul."""
45212,Lisa,"the first episode was just a pilot, dad. producers fiddle with shows all the time. they change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
51808,Lisa,but when you think of the things we lack...
43379,Lisa,"let's go now, mr. puente."
41679,Lisa,"mom, chloe just won the peabody award!"
49710,Lisa,you left a trail of lost winter clothes.
50279,Lisa,"oh my god, me too!"
43945,Lisa,"oh, great. i'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
47811,Lisa,looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
50071,Lisa,"hi, nelson."
42818,Lisa,where's grampa? wasn't he invited?
50440,Lisa,get thee behind me namuche! that's the buddhist satan. let's give it a shot.
45230,Lisa,"hey, why don't you come to the wild animal park with us?"
42437,Lisa,uh huh.
47293,Lisa,prime minister tony blair!?
51102,Lisa,"splatter, as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand--"
42584,Lisa,"eww, dad, this is blood."
51233,Lisa,"but when we got home, he was waiting inside!"
46738,Lisa,i live in a house.
52256,Lisa,and i'm going over to janey's again. we're going to be... um... making the most of our childhood years.
47212,Lisa,it must be tough to win the nobel prize and lose your father on the same day.
46382,Lisa,when are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
47835,Lisa,i mean a man and a woman.
51100,Lisa,that's odd.
45845,Lisa,"oh, mom. i want to be a dancer!"
49702,Lisa,"we'll be closer than best friends for the rest of our lives. but you'll never know what that's like, because you won't ever have a brother."
43456,Lisa,not in any of the ones you know about.
48818,Lisa,shout!
47663,Lisa,"dad, how could you say these things?"
52510,Lisa,you parked the car. that helped.
47136,Lisa,"i'm sure she's just running late. or, she's not coming because she doesn't understand how special you are."
48237,Lisa,okay. how do you address an archbishop?
46752,Lisa,"mom, dad, thank god you're okay."
52517,Lisa,well... someone calls someone.
50567,Lisa,"i was raised in a traveling circus. my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber. i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box. it was featured in the new yorker's ""best forty under four"" issue."
49573,Lisa,hi.
42784,Lisa,ow! that was a big one.
52357,Lisa,"yuck. quit it, dad."
47688,Lisa,"hurry, mom!"
42976,Lisa,"this time, he's the lesser of two evils."
45528,Lisa,no it isn't. it's totally inaccurate--
50102,Lisa,"thanks, guys."
44908,Lisa,yayyy!
41618,Lisa,"i just had a worrisome thought! if there can be two incarnations of the simpsons, why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others?"
46912,Lisa,i don't think so.
47836,Lisa,why are we dressed as sunday best simpsons for dinner with aunt patty?
45474,Lisa,aagghh!
52509,Lisa,how did my daughter turn into my brother?
49186,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's on the move!
51460,Lisa,"well, i thought it was because it was tote bag day."
43202,Lisa,"oh, that's cute."
42543,Lisa,"it's from my pen pal, anya!"
49656,Lisa,sorry -- i have a tea party at janey's.
45488,Lisa,497... 498 words. hmph.
46768,Lisa,"goldie, you were more than just a goldfish -- you were a member of the family."
52286,Lisa,i can dig it!
48361,Lisa,uh... boy... man... boyman. jake boyman.
48099,Lisa,"i bet that bra was planted by sterling, to break them up."
51309,Lisa,a reagan republican?
46676,Lisa,the speakers are poor because we're letting just anybody do it.
44865,Lisa,"aha! it's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north."
46772,Lisa,"""i dream of a world without guns."" don't we all, william."
51531,Lisa,"don't do it, dad. don't cheat."
50070,Lisa,"nelson, i just wanted to say that i realize now you can't be anyone else other than who you are, and..."
48782,Lisa,"this film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. mixed signals, hmm."
47700,Lisa,"check it out, girls. sixty-eight squares of ankle-busting fury!"
43263,Lisa,"hi, dad."
41776,Lisa,daaad!
49914,Lisa,whales are mammals like us! they're sensitive and deeply intelligent!
42972,Lisa,"when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her."
48293,Lisa,he also happens to be toot-toot's son.
45707,Lisa,"i'm writing a letter to president clinton about that travesty of a band contest. as a fellow sax player, i'm sure he'll be outraged."
46816,Lisa,you did better than me?!
51021,Lisa,milhouse?
42849,Lisa,but...
44813,Lisa,"well, not literally. but in a way, isn't he everyone's son? for you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. no, bart's not to blame. you can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. i'm lisa simpson."
51937,Lisa,he'll give you good advice. he's the toughest simpson alive.
45874,Lisa,"i'm sorry, vicki. i just wanted to be a dancer so badly."
41850,Lisa,"uh, excuse me, i have the chocolate milk."
45708,Lisa,"really -- hey, what are you doing?"
48219,Lisa,i would have guessed low.
51710,Lisa,"oh no! king toot's is closed! dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
44555,Lisa,"ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. big deal."
48750,Lisa,the sixth-grade security camera shows three empty desks!
45311,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i'm putting an end to this."
48529,Lisa,"oh, moe."
51389,Lisa,"stop it, stop it! why in the world would you burn a book?"
45756,Lisa,"let him up, please."
49733,Lisa,um... what if someone were to lose larry?
45487,Lisa,"uh, i don't think so."
42464,Lisa,this is a rather lifeless outing.
49400,Lisa,"as a rational skeptic, i find that hard to believe. also, as a vegetarian, i hope there's not meat in that sauce."
49277,Lisa,"mom, dad! our mall got a mapple store!"
46225,Lisa,no. the reason is chemical.
51282,Lisa,"ooh, good... nice... ""beat dallas."" can never argue with that."
49344,Lisa,that's today!
49258,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
49515,Lisa,mom! mom! we know where dad is!
45954,Lisa,mom!
44205,Lisa,why do you have to make this so hard?
51659,Lisa,that was unmotivated.
50749,Lisa,"bart, how could you?"
43817,Lisa,that's the home-owner tax.
42099,Lisa,"oh, bart."
44149,Lisa,"mom, john likes ""itchy and scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
50586,Lisa,genius.
50636,Lisa,hm...
46465,Lisa,"well, i'm looking for a new faith. one that isn't so materialistic."
45406,Lisa,"oh dad, i just spent the day with the most wonderful people."
42001,Lisa,let's see... football... football: homo-eroticism in... oddball canadian rules... phyllis george and...
49059,Lisa,"wow, you did learn a lot at 4-h."
50814,Lisa,"well, i'm smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not ""mean funny,"" and i never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away."
41591,Lisa,yeah. i miss christmas.
48330,Lisa,"mother, we must protect him. look, he's praying."
42165,Lisa,"don't patronize me, doctor."
41600,Lisa,"yeah, i'm starting to see that."
49731,Lisa,he's in here. safe and sound. let me just staple that bag for you.
48409,Lisa,"mom, you really have to choose here, between science and belief."
51148,Lisa,"it's a hologram?! well, maybe if it's in good taste..."
50253,Lisa,"ms. stewart, i made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles!"
50880,Lisa,i hope you're happy. you all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class.
43753,Lisa,why are there so many burnt-out ones?
41990,Lisa,"really, where?"
50518,Lisa,yes it is! that's all it is!
46360,Lisa,we have to disable its central processor! c'mon!
44641,Lisa,"no one, but if we're gonna survive, we need rules and order. let's not forget what we learned in the u.n. club."
46462,Lisa,i'm going out for a walk.
51001,Lisa,"bart simpson, i don't know what the future holds for you..."
46265,Lisa,greenpeace?
45193,Lisa,doughy's has terrible pizza.
51712,Lisa,(impressed noise
48646,Lisa,pre-tentious laughs at bunuel retrospectives...outsider art made by mental defectives!
51379,Lisa,an angelica button wizard robe... with wand pocket!
45621,Lisa,eep.
45502,Lisa,what bad things? why?
49953,Lisa,blondie?
43102,Lisa,"okay, i will."
45224,Lisa,"eww, why is courtney love on the wheaties box?"
48980,Lisa,his foot is caught in my button hole.
48667,Lisa,it begins.
46694,Lisa,you're the jerk.
44857,Lisa,never mind.
43539,Lisa,da-ad!
48798,Lisa,"yay, dad!"
47858,Lisa,"i like eating here with you, dad. especially without ""don't have a cow, man."""
42865,Lisa,"you're younger than me, too?"
51743,Lisa,you mean like europeans were to the native americans? or the belgians were to the congo?
41741,Lisa,maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. lets see...
46829,Lisa,the bus!
43308,Lisa,pointless.
42463,Lisa,lois sanborn.
51918,Lisa,you're welcome.
47333,Lisa,"krusty, what's wrong?"
52084,Lisa,"wow, a quarter past six. what's keeping dad?"
46044,Lisa,"well, there's lots of needy kids out there..."
43340,Lisa,it's only maggie.
47885,Lisa,"well, i think -- in these days of petro-terrorists and ozone depletion -- a sunday drive reeks of bio-hubris."
42845,Lisa,what are you writing here? a play?
45619,Lisa,"wow, what a perfect scene. this was so worth it..."
48766,Lisa,we have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!
49507,Lisa,"you were born while they were married so legally, no. but in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
47066,Lisa,maybe geology...
49351,Lisa,"i have a best friend! you heard me say that, didn't you?"
49455,Lisa,oh sure.
45887,Lisa,"we're jamming, mom. she's painting my music, and i'm playing to her painting."
45151,Lisa,"doctor hibbert, i thought you'd located another kidney for grampa."
51288,Lisa,me too.
44980,Lisa,so un-ask her.
50129,Lisa,can you put a number on it?
41719,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate.
48919,Lisa,"you know, mom and dad are almost forty, and bart is ten. that means you didn't have him until way after high school."
49798,Lisa,so dusty.
43662,Lisa,"yeah, krusty doesn't want to be a clown. he's happy just being another blue-collar bozo."
43629,Lisa,i don't know what mom's thinking. this whole country club scene is so decadent...
47244,Lisa,i may be the new girl / but you can't brainwash me / just osh-kosh-b'gosh me / and then leave me be /
51741,Lisa,"are we truly in space? and if so, why?"
45864,Lisa,"most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
46241,Lisa,africa looks like a beautiful jewel.
45266,Lisa,"bart, stop it."
45521,Lisa,i think that was implied by what i said.
50188,Lisa,mom?
49319,Lisa,nay.
44097,Lisa,look! what's that?!!
49485,Lisa,maggie?
42927,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
44197,Lisa,"bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
45642,Lisa,"bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!"
49898,Lisa,"you're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. now go and be free."
50351,Lisa,would you... be interested in teaching me?
49764,Lisa,yeah. or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
49930,Lisa,she doesn't like lying on the beach! she likes being in the ocean!
49683,Lisa,with perfect faith and perfect love.
44787,Lisa,"we'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. and now, bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch."
43852,Lisa,"hey, will you guys sign my yearbook?"
42587,Lisa,satisfied?
49875,Lisa,jews don't believe in hell.
49416,Lisa,"several?! that's more than ""a few"" and almost ""a bunch!"""
45853,Lisa,"i'm just walking. listen, i know i said i wanted to be a dancer, but..."
50401,Lisa,three more big ones and we'll talk.
47904,Lisa,look!
41684,Lisa,the rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
45539,Lisa,"wait, dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
41898,Lisa,"whayda ya know, she's right."
51182,Lisa,mom! bart's twisting facts in an orwellian fashion!
47598,Lisa,how romantic. you and dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it.
49155,Lisa,"well, i do owe you everything... make it quick."
42156,Lisa,"finally, a copy of ""ethan frome"" to call my own."
51857,Lisa,"not i.d., dad. id. it's a word."
44016,Lisa,"please don't ruin this for me, bart. i think he's starting to like me!"
52072,Lisa,"don't you remember the get-well card we sent to krusty? it was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in."
48086,Lisa,"okay, gotta keep calm. if scooby doo has taught me anything, it's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers."
48973,Lisa,what was that?
47799,Lisa,no.
49571,Lisa,"hi, caitlin."
48357,Lisa,"well, what can i do? they won't let me in the boys' school."
47145,Lisa,"oh, i had my first crush, and all it did was make me do terrible things and then break my heart."
46297,Lisa,what do your friends call you?
46685,Lisa,"well, it delivers what it promises."
48137,Lisa,"sure, that's all you men do is, take and take and take, without regard to feelings or unicorns...here, take my lunch, too!"
41940,Lisa,"come here, maggie."
42758,Lisa,you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
50196,Lisa,"people of springfield, to quote shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
47120,Lisa,i'm sick of this horse slapping and cow taunting! i'm going to my room!
42983,Lisa,"this is so cool, bart. we're just like woodward and bernstein!"
48684,Lisa,and this website will tell you the weather.
45084,Lisa,i'm afraid i can't allow that.
47880,Lisa,"listen, i've got a plan to get ling back. but we must be discreet. you never know where there might be a spy."
52471,Lisa,wanna go to a concert tonight? sixty-eight percent of the original cher is playing.
48907,Lisa,oh dear god.
42332,Lisa,mr. lanley! aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
42487,Lisa,oh no. no!
43378,Lisa,he's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
46421,Lisa,you pulled me out of school for this?!
50663,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, i didn't mean to be nosey."
41794,Lisa,what did you do to it?
52089,Lisa,but i want to see what happens.
51721,Lisa,"mom, i'm just a kid. but i say if dad isn't here christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from."
45618,Lisa,"so hard, but so rewarding... downhill skiers missing fun... oh, who am i kidding?"
48526,Lisa,you guys go ahead. i don't think i'd be very good company...
43225,Lisa,hi mom.
47129,Lisa,wanna play a little longer? it's only ten and the moon is awful big.
42600,Lisa,"but, no, we killed mr. burns."
43529,Lisa,"i don't know, bart. something tells me willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine."
48676,Lisa,"i agree, mom, it's very sad. but we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos."
48871,Lisa,"it's ""hoist with his own petard."""
42496,Lisa,yeah.
47229,Lisa,"and the winner is, seventeen!"
47374,Lisa,"well, i think it's only fair i get to name him. you got to name me."
50142,Lisa,"sir, i'm not trying to take your son away from you. i plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes."
43097,Lisa,"mom, you've been cooking all night?"
51376,Lisa,"if i have to give presents, i'll give presents with a purpose. one for maggie... check."
44962,Lisa,i am not wearing this.
47190,Lisa,"way to go, mom. homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce!"
43725,Lisa,did he die?
44516,Lisa,"ahh, here's dr. gould now. what were the results, professor?"
44585,Lisa,"that was pretty bad, bart / but it could've been worse / you could have been carrying a sequined purse!"
48712,Lisa,hide the sports section!
51694,Lisa,attention goblins: madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars. and people are laying fingers all over them.
48891,Lisa,bob planned this from the beginning --
43160,Lisa,haven't you ever looked at your globe?
42378,Lisa,i get the idea.
43743,Lisa,i don't understand it. we're always the ones who solve these problems.
48031,Lisa,cooper! thy staves are not flush!
46593,Lisa,"hey, i've earned their trust."
44993,Lisa,"all right, all right. d.m.y."
42665,Lisa,"dad, maybe this will cheer you up."
43041,Lisa,he said it was just a name.
52005,Lisa,it's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
49061,Lisa,he wants to know your name.
48688,Lisa,"dad, i'm going to play soccer."
48776,Lisa,make room for jumbo.
43570,Lisa,"no, dad, it's a rhetorical question."
44108,Lisa,if you wish to be our sitter / please be sweet and never bitter / help us with math and book reports /
51183,Lisa,"orwell, obscure? the author of ""animal farm?"""
43172,Lisa,what?!
47440,Lisa,what? really?
47352,Lisa,"actually, most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic. in fact, as a buddhist, i believe people would be a lot happier without presents."
45373,Lisa,uh... where are you?
44803,Lisa,"hey, here's another letter for bart's people."
48055,Lisa,we've gotta tell dad! where is he?
45927,Lisa,"wait, let me check the book."
44878,Lisa,dad!
49568,Lisa,b plus?!
50921,Lisa,"so if i'm growing grasshoppers to eat, am i a farmer or a rancher? there are gonna be a lot of heated blogs on this topic."
42231,Lisa,"some people say that to love your country is old fashioned, uncool, real melvin... well to them i say oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain..."
42605,Lisa,"have a blast, mom!"
44796,Lisa,"hmm, thank you, bart, for yet another touching ""bart's people."" now, turning to--"
50864,Lisa,why is this happening to us?
44845,Lisa,"well... if it would put your mind at ease, i could take a limousine. although that would cost two hundred dollars..."
47385,Lisa,"i guess you're right, principal tamzarian."
49314,Lisa,"ooh, another grobanite!"
43987,Lisa,"hi, dad. you know, there's buns in the cabinet."
50756,Lisa,"nelson, don't you want my lunch money?"
45313,Lisa,"mom, i need to get some sleep! i have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. i mean, english."
44365,Lisa,lisa. you're talking to lisa.
44000,Lisa,"thanks, but i prefer the honest way."
44915,Lisa,it's a bottle cap.
49294,Lisa,think differently... think differently... think differently... think differently...
50922,Lisa,"you know, shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers. they're both arthropods..."
48631,Lisa,"at bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. and you know what? no monsters have gotten me yet."
49156,Lisa,i don't recognize any of them.
48704,Lisa,"gimme, gimme, gimme!"
42276,Lisa,bart! the winfields didn't have a son.
45570,Lisa,are you okay?
46305,Lisa,that sounds like fat tony.
42974,Lisa,"i meant your other mortal enemy, sideshow bob."
41953,Lisa,"it's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, dad. we watch an appalling amount of tv."
52041,Lisa,dad!
49047,Lisa,bart... you do know what happens next.
41949,Lisa,what?
46110,Lisa,"they are coming back for us, aren't they?"
49734,Lisa,where'd you get this rope?
45878,Lisa,"oh, i love you guys."
45860,Lisa,curtain puller?!
41830,Lisa,you give that back. that belongs to me! that's mine!
43535,Lisa,sorry.
49197,Lisa,"mom, ""bart"" has something to tell you."
50886,Lisa,are you playing poker with my college fund?
46934,Lisa,they must have come from over there.
42449,Lisa,so did mine.
48369,Lisa,i have to go.
50719,Lisa,"listen, everyone! we should fall asleep in this dream! one minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below!"
46731,Lisa,sixteen.
48851,Lisa,who is it?
50507,Lisa,it's about an asteroid!
46656,Lisa,we're never gonna find him.
42417,Lisa,bart!!!!!
50780,Lisa,"um, can i be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?"
42678,Lisa,but inside it's mostly about ross perot. and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial.
47214,Lisa,"oh come on, don't you get it? bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch."
51338,Lisa,i'll make both.
50064,Lisa,"that's great, mr. zuckerberg, but i was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
46145,Lisa,that's not grampa. dad's just dehydrated.
52052,Lisa,"hi, sideshow bob."
44716,Lisa,but those candy bars are all squished and melted.
43709,Lisa,"but when you found the truth, you couldn't take it! you couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud! so you covered it up! didn't you? didn't you?!"
42631,Lisa,"dad, why are you singing?"
47071,Lisa,"dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
48457,Lisa,"bart, does that even mean anything?"
42230,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
43040,Lisa,"i have to join the team, or i'll get an ""f"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
46454,Lisa,no! i'm leaving this church forever!
51446,Lisa,this is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
41952,Lisa,doesn't mom do that stuff?
43143,Lisa,it blew up the bridge!
44067,Lisa,the hurricane's over.
42846,Lisa,"yuh huh. ""cast of characters: viceroy fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..."""
50258,Lisa,...everywhere you go
42940,Lisa,"ah, your first kiss."
45959,Lisa,"oh, yeah? you didn't blow up maggie's room."
43067,Lisa,i'm coming!
46306,Lisa,mom? where'd you get that car?
47382,Lisa,"look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. my cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball."
42357,Lisa,"dad, can i..."
48748,Lisa,ew! he is slimy!
43734,Lisa,the judge says it's okay as long as you pay mr. lampwick royalties.
47762,Lisa,miss lucy had a steamboat / the steamboat had a bell...
45344,Lisa,"good work, dad."
51933,Lisa,"hey, everybody. here comes my brother, bart the bully­ killer!"
43917,Lisa,i'll start with radio shack.
51929,Lisa,"look, janey, cupcakes."
50016,Lisa,"friday evening we performed ""angels in america: a gay fantasia on national themes."" part one: millennium approaches..."
47256,Lisa,"well, i am proud of my light."
50964,Lisa,what's hopeless?
51881,Lisa,"no, you do!"
48019,Lisa,why didn't we listen to dad?
43332,Lisa,but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do.
48933,Lisa,do you do it with relish?
51836,Lisa,i do!
44547,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. we'll help you study."
47031,Lisa,"miss sloane, how are you handling the change from la-la land to blah-blah land?"
45640,Lisa,slivered almonds for the green beans! i'll be right back.
49477,Lisa,"crimes... ""kill"" ""holy""... ""sage""..."
43756,Lisa,"houston, we have a problem. homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
46327,Lisa,he's speaking in tongues!
46278,Lisa,"dad, no!"
47465,Lisa,"right, right."
43582,Lisa,"bart, no!"
52246,Lisa,"another barrier broken. right on, sister!"
42757,Lisa,we won't.
48372,Lisa,"you just want somebody to say ""i love you"". i love you."
44764,Lisa,the government has no right to use you this way.
43090,Lisa,"look on the bright side, dad. did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
45285,Lisa,i just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
45863,Lisa,i get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
51537,Lisa,"wow, the amazon is just like i pictured it after seeing all those pictures online."
41604,Lisa,"oh, that's so noble. but what about jenda?"
50410,Lisa,you're gonna regret the day you were born!
52364,Lisa,"ooh... phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? oh, do your own homework, bart!"
43744,Lisa,"dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
49246,Lisa,wish me luck.
43906,Lisa,"oh. thanks, bart."
42042,Lisa,i'm aware of the time.
44159,Lisa,"i know it's hard to accept, bart, but face it: sideshow bob has changed."
50366,Lisa,"students, teachers, detentionees...prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged!"
50019,Lisa,"saturday morning, and then... noooo!"
49465,Lisa,the biggest ring in springfield...comes from the bell in the springfield bell tower!
49861,Lisa,this isn't a dream. i really did fail.
51868,Lisa,i don't know what else to do.
43524,Lisa,"okay, but promise you won't be grouchy."
41705,Lisa,i didn't think you'd understand.
50865,Lisa,but--
44388,Lisa,"""...if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the east river at your expense."""
52111,Lisa,an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
42477,Lisa,"no, we're just curious."
44063,Lisa,but i'm not fruit! i'm a kid!
51286,Lisa,"if they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!"
50933,Lisa,i'll be cool.
45668,Lisa,he told us he'd been going to the gym.
50932,Lisa,"bart! i can't eat bugs anymore. please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild."
51116,Lisa,"i'm sorry i was inconsiderate, milhouse. and furthermore, i respect you more for saying ""no."""
42197,Lisa,"""our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy..."""
52098,Lisa,he isn't.
52157,Lisa,"""mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"""
43674,Lisa,what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? look.
43304,Lisa,"i've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far."
51848,Lisa,rudolph the red nosed reindeer / had a very shiny nose / and if you ever saw it / you would even say it glowed
51027,Lisa,it's just enough to get home. i'm hungry now.
51491,Lisa,nooooo!
46688,Lisa,"dad, i'm no fan of bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger."
50703,Lisa,"maureen dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do."
41698,Lisa,but i need you too.
50940,Lisa,"dad, check this out!"
44083,Lisa,"mom, this is no time to be conservative. let's roll the dice here."
48691,Lisa,you already promised you would.
43920,Lisa,"science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and chinese food. but i can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
44574,Lisa,i think they're running out of tomatoes.
42389,Lisa,what if he wants a kiss?
45353,Lisa,shhh. don't wake them.
51897,Lisa,you're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?
48476,Lisa,i guess that's it. these animals are all gonna die.
49721,Lisa,bart!
44294,Lisa,"my name is lisa, mr. burns. lisa simpson."
50899,Lisa,"and money is college, which should lead to more money some day, but who knows anymore?"
45177,Lisa,drinking their coffee...
43875,Lisa,"hey, what's hap--"
45018,Lisa,"mom, they put every kid in america in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. it's all a big scam."
47837,Lisa,i thought you said aunt patty was just waiting for the right man.
51884,Lisa,"hey bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!"
50192,Lisa,"i don't know! they won't tell me! and besides... you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy! mom, i'd be honored if i turned out like you."
42225,Lisa,it's hopeless.
42692,Lisa,dad... that's over ten thousand miles away.
45118,Lisa,"actually, there are four plusses."
48262,Lisa,"oh. all right, um, i'll tell you something that happened to me last week. i was walking home from school..."
51692,Lisa,"let me take care of that. if there's one thing i know how to do, it's manipulate barts."
49743,Lisa,just give me this!
49253,Lisa,you got highlights in your hair!
43754,Lisa,maybe we can make your job more fun... what are those?
51248,Lisa,i have a solution!
44832,Lisa,i've got some!
42162,Lisa,"so, bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty?"
43712,Lisa,how else could he have gotten this?
50322,Lisa,these are comedy albums?
42906,Lisa,enough with the hose!
49667,Lisa,"well i'm glad you're not ""witches."" wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me."
49523,Lisa,that's horrible. what else?
48295,Lisa,"listen, we can trade mr. teeny for bart. we just have to find a way to get him up there."
51729,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
43128,Lisa,"so dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
45075,Lisa,"hey, dad, it says they need your full name. you only put down your middle initial."
41725,Lisa,yes. ten please.
48670,Lisa,"sure, i guess. a couple of birds pooped on it over here."
44914,Lisa,"what are we looking for, anyway?"
46560,Lisa,nooo!
44332,Lisa,"wait, look."
48733,Lisa,"mom, is dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
42944,Lisa,yayyy!
43749,Lisa,i've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
52527,Lisa,"okay honey, i made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty."
48075,Lisa,what about bart's bedroom?
45792,Lisa,absolutely. i want you and your pals to go away to camp david and write up a report on coolness.
42713,Lisa,"is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
45393,Lisa,doesn't anybody in this town read?
44539,Lisa,hardly. anyone could have written that.
51351,Lisa,i know what i've got to do.
43010,Lisa,okay.
48884,Lisa,you never ask what we've been up to. we went to the strawberry patch and i picked the most strawberries!
42670,Lisa,why are you so happy?
46804,Lisa,networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
49122,Lisa,we fooled her... betsy.
43178,Lisa,"how's dad, today?"
48965,Lisa,don't make me say indian again!
49425,Lisa,hooray! i'm a brainy outcast again!
42352,Lisa,"ahhh, i can see the music."
51469,Lisa,your grampa's alive?
47728,Lisa,that was you.
48172,Lisa,"but luigi, surely you speak italian."
41764,Lisa,"well, all right -- if you listen to the poem i just wrote."
48912,Lisa,ralph and i used to date.
45471,Lisa,you'll see...
50982,Lisa,"look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. so, do the ones you know first. if you don't know one, guess b and move on. now, what is the capital of massachusetts?"
44117,Lisa,it's the american wayyy!
51969,Lisa,"""i got a bratty brother / he bugs me every day / and this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / my dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / i'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."""
41870,Lisa,no bart. knowledge.
51262,Lisa,bart! i'm gonna tell!
50227,Lisa,you're gonna put him down?
47616,Lisa,i'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear.
48568,Lisa,"oh, man. now he's even mooching our lunches."
50860,Lisa,and i have to ask... has anyone seen the cat?
42965,Lisa,"but mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. it brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
42893,Lisa,you're a wonderful person.
43221,Lisa,"beautiful dinnerware, mrs. parkfield."
51736,Lisa,we have been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the cool zone.
47924,Lisa,"no, you do. you're gay for moleman!"
47718,Lisa,"this is the perfect test -- if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop, i'll know i've conquered food at last."
51781,Lisa,he is. and may i save that paper?
42091,Lisa,"come on, bart. in your pre-fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
46417,Lisa,he did it! he saved her!
50242,Lisa,"so i never want to see another christmas tree... until mom comes back, safe and sound."
45846,Lisa,"well, i think world war ii helped a little, mom."
47243,Lisa,what would you change?
52220,Lisa,mom!
42255,Lisa,wait bart! maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell.
50240,Lisa,don't worry about that. i love meat and i always will.
44384,Lisa,yay!
44801,Lisa,stop talking like that! stop it!
49199,Lisa,there's bart!
50523,Lisa,"mom, they're here on purpose! they're foodies."
43347,Lisa,you didn't know him! nobody knew him! but he was a great man! and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy!
46644,Lisa,mm-hmm.
46075,Lisa,what did he look like?
51456,Lisa,"well... there is something i should have told you. you see, it occurred to me that if i can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't i modify... me!"
52324,Lisa,"no. and, since i'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, i'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair prince."
49974,Lisa,"when there's cruelty involved, bart sure knows his history."
52428,Lisa,"i don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect."
50455,Lisa,keep the change.
46527,Lisa,is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
43694,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
51811,Lisa,"well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it."
49188,Lisa,where's maggie?
50067,Lisa,didn't anybody here stay in school?
51557,Lisa,just the two of us?
44379,Lisa,"oh, if only i were in springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. oh, god, i'm delirious!"
51356,Lisa,hey. i'm sorry i fired you.
43188,Lisa,ewww.
47043,Lisa,you said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. and now they're worse than ever.
46540,Lisa,we gotta coordinate on this thing.
41956,Lisa,ariel.
49393,Lisa,vance connor...
47345,Lisa,"cool, a toy store!"
45150,Lisa,i can't imagine dad running away like this. leaving his father to die.
45216,Lisa,eww.
51455,Lisa,thank you. answer the question.
43088,Lisa,"dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
42312,Lisa,i don't see your name on it.
44876,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i give up."
44437,Lisa,yo! / yayyy! i do! / i do! / right here! / yay! / i do! / let's go!
51545,Lisa,what does that mean?
45372,Lisa,"ohh, poor mr. costner. he tries so hard."
44354,Lisa,sorry. sorry. i know we'll be friends. talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
41642,Lisa,"oh, no... i think i'm getting a crush on nelson muntz!"
42703,Lisa,a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
52161,Lisa,"but mom, we've become the tools of evil."
44321,Lisa,"um, dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. it's..."
52401,Lisa,"mom, these are really good. while i know first-hand how fragile young talent is, i'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed."
49592,Lisa,please don't say a man.
42900,Lisa,is it okay?!
42866,Lisa,"no. i just like to smell my lunch... gee, i never met anyone who skipped a grade before."
49210,Lisa,it's not a pedal boat. it's a pedal car that bart drove into the river. because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
51280,Lisa,"actually, i've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug."
43259,Lisa,that's a horrible thing to say.
47079,Lisa,yes.
46273,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
44185,Lisa,"okay, chief. enjoy bob saget!"
47902,Lisa,"yeah, kiss and make up!"
44435,Lisa,i'm happy for you.
51494,Lisa,i've lost my guinea pig!
51875,Lisa,yeah!
45455,Lisa,yes! got 'em!
41785,Lisa,"wow, a bald eagle."
41769,Lisa,"i thought so. oh, bart, you..."
42489,Lisa,i learned how many drams in a pennyweight.
43057,Lisa,"don't worry, i'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
52373,Lisa,"dad, this is our pet. we can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?"
47482,Lisa,i used to be the smart one.
44844,Lisa,"ahm... i wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. she said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room."
51130,Lisa,okay!
51478,Lisa,"i'm sorry, mom."
47284,Lisa,"well, what can i be?"
43556,Lisa,mom! dad! bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
51598,Lisa,happy mother's day.
42970,Lisa,"dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is."
43598,Lisa,"...and you'll be bartron, the evil robot from mars, gone berserk."
43955,Lisa,"hi, mrs. owl! you're out kind of early!"
42459,Lisa,"bart, you can't go on like this."
45520,Lisa,"well, look at the wonders of the computer age now."
50456,Lisa,how did this bookshelf get here so fast? i bet it's shoddy.
42991,Lisa,i have a plan. i think we can trap him.
42057,Lisa,"dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
43613,Lisa,bart got a present early? then i should get a present early! i want a present!
48615,Lisa,and that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? they had seven names for that.
47507,Lisa,both of us heard mysterious noises coming from this very spot.
48550,Lisa,no! we have to read it together.
47528,Lisa,"dad, that's our address."
42816,Lisa,yeesh. how much was it?
47704,Lisa,shut up! i do not!
45546,Lisa,you're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. you've gotta destroy this plant.
52226,Lisa,i saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / my soul carved in slices by spikey-haired demons...
47603,Lisa,i can't believe you stood mom up.
41900,Lisa,"dad, i'm calling about the school talent show."
51628,Lisa,"wrapping you in bubble wrap. i can't always be around to protect you, so it will."
48551,Lisa,"hey bart, do you want some ice cream? i just hit a major marshmallow vein - ooo, i think it goes all the way to the bottom!"
52423,Lisa,"no, really, i can't."
45914,Lisa,"hey, what's goin' on?"
42305,Lisa,daaad!
45359,Lisa,"oh no, bart has stolen the elderly!"
49401,Lisa,"no, that's it."
47213,Lisa,what the...?!
52288,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
41714,Lisa,"i'm sorry i called you a baboon, dad."
47205,Lisa,"sir, your son has brought you into the twenty-first century. it's a lot like the twentieth, except everybody's afraid and the stock market is much lower."
44039,Lisa,he's not like you anymore! he's changed! and he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums!
48384,Lisa,peew! peew!
50247,Lisa,"yes, but then i learned that there's always hope. someday this war will be over. someday our mom will be back."
48053,Lisa,ew.
48150,Lisa,and i will be your campaign manager!
41774,Lisa,"bye, bye, leon / bye, roomie / bye, pardner / you're a credit to dementia!"
44557,Lisa,"well, i'm proud of you, mom. you refused to compromise your integrity."
42879,Lisa,what's happening... oh... it was just a dream.
45088,Lisa,i am so scared.
42837,Lisa,"dad, as you know, we've been swimming. and we've developed a taste for it. we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of..."
46212,Lisa,"not talking, eh willie? just listen, then. i think i figured out what sets off that big ape francine... willie? willie?"
52244,Lisa,i reached him.
45851,Lisa,"yeah, well, no offense, but maybe i need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
47224,Lisa,"dad, i'm just as sad as you are. what happened to grandma is an outrage."
50913,Lisa,lisa.
48793,Lisa,one... two...
46022,Lisa,"dear moe, if anything should ever happen to me, i want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... dad, i can't--"
49519,Lisa,yes you do.
48677,Lisa,"ooo, there's my first saxophone recital!"
45779,Lisa,"goodnight, america."
46468,Lisa,that would be so great.
45437,Lisa,"no, no, we're going to paris. i can feel it."
49097,Lisa,this is it! my premiere!
42005,Lisa,"mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
42571,Lisa,bobo. it's mr. burns' bear all right.
50603,Lisa,"ms. dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate krusty?"
52236,Lisa,just tell me you're sorry.
49795,Lisa,...dad's idea pad...
43622,Lisa,"hey, mom! there's something in here!"
42943,Lisa,yayyyyyy!
47505,Lisa,"dad, i don't like this movie. can we go home?"
50697,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd say it was a town meeting."
47882,Lisa,"yeah, dad. if you don't look perfect, you'll never be able to sneak in and steal ling back."
45496,Lisa,not anymore. i don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
47165,Lisa,"but he won't, because he's too cowardly."
43490,Lisa,yes. i'm gonna marry a carrot.
49778,Lisa,just take 'em.
43470,Lisa,"compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment."
48345,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. ooh, paintings by female artists! frida kahlo, georgia o'keefe..."
45035,Lisa,bolivian tree lizard?
42506,Lisa,"mom, can you bring me more o.j.?"
51584,Lisa,what do you want?
49690,Lisa,"no, thank you. i've been rational but nerdy my whole life. but these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. cool! me! lisa simpson!"
43404,Lisa,chief wig-gum... don't eat... the clues.
43606,Lisa,christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship jesus christ.
51425,Lisa,"you know, bart, just because diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
47306,Lisa,"oh, my god! we've made a terrible mistake. this tunnel comes out in the worst possible place."
42747,Lisa,what's so special about this game anyway? it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville. they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
43336,Lisa,"oh, dad!"
48312,Lisa,how many bulls / must my grandfather kill...
43170,Lisa,"bart, i'm sorry i'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the woolumbaloo dirt monument is just too exciting to pass up."
43453,Lisa,how're the southwestern pizza fingers?
46883,Lisa,no.
51210,Lisa,"dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused."
48505,Lisa,"my report on a ""fascinating springfielder"" is due monday, and everybody i've tried to interview is so boring."
42961,Lisa,"dad, i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend."
52181,Lisa,our journey begins here at the library.
46512,Lisa,"now, bart!"
49495,Lisa,i'll be less stressed! and i'm really freakin' stressed!
51347,Lisa,and those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times. so if that's a liberal then i am a liberal... and hang me.
51141,Lisa,"using something this town has never ever seen: good, honest police work."
46580,Lisa,i'm annie oakley!
41587,Lisa,"if you have to guess, guess ""b."""
43398,Lisa,mr. burns is the richest man in town. maybe it was about money.
43653,Lisa,oh my god! krusty's shoes!
42253,Lisa,yes.
43705,Lisa,no! not janey! she'll pack the supreme court with boys!
42689,Lisa,i think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
47864,Lisa,"okay, that's two... ...and that's it. if i think of another one, i'll let him back in."
50324,Lisa,is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the blockbuster used to be?
47677,Lisa,"to get maggie in time, we'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body's information super-highway!"
43367,Lisa,"whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
48854,Lisa,"milhouse, that was the bravest thing i've ever seen."
47161,Lisa,i'm not a coward.
45932,Lisa,"yeah, right. / i'm sure. / pffft."
51783,Lisa,that's even worse!
52090,Lisa,"oh, no!"
45384,Lisa,"an open letter to the people of springfield: today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding."
42839,Lisa,"yes, dad."
48417,Lisa,"i'm sorry, mom. i should have just gone with the flow like you said."
52117,Lisa,is too.
51946,Lisa,i choose not to participate.
51917,Lisa,"here, otto, i made an extra one for you."
49718,Lisa,i wanna do that!
51821,Lisa,"dad, do you have anything i can eat?"
42702,Lisa,"thanks for buying us these toys, grampa."
51013,Lisa,he's right here.
43567,Lisa,these are the calling cards of a con artist.
44254,Lisa,mo-om!
42779,Lisa,ow! my hair!
43138,Lisa,what!?
47673,Lisa,"well, you can't fight fate, but if you must shoot our father, please remember our family motto: ""not in the face."""
45526,Lisa,mom.
46413,Lisa,no!
45743,Lisa,stop kicking me!
51796,Lisa,mr. teeny?
47311,Lisa,flowers.
43925,Lisa,hmmm. looks about the same.
50629,Lisa,"hi, guys, what are you doing?"
49606,Lisa,"well, i qualified for the national math bee--"
51291,Lisa,"no is the saddest experience you'll ever know / yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know..."
47091,Lisa,"now we merely push this switch to ""overload."" yet once we do, we'll be breaking the law. can good truly come from civil disobedience? gandhi thought so..."
50820,Lisa,"i love npr, and jazz guitar..."
48112,Lisa,i hate going to the zoo. i feel so sorry for the animals.
43975,Lisa,"oh, no!"
50377,Lisa,haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face?
51787,Lisa,foolish boy. you'll never guess elon musk's master password.
46754,Lisa,"dad, it's a blackout."
42186,Lisa,"it is the real krusty. look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
51684,Lisa,this is the robot who claims to be from the future.
43946,Lisa,shouldn't you people be groveling? and bring me some shoes. nice ones!
43942,Lisa,"listen, i can take care of everything. all you have to do is unshrink me."
49313,Lisa,always.
44199,Lisa,"oh, look, bart, now you got maggie all upset!"
44969,Lisa,"i don't want a date! and i don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! am i the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""the mclaughlin group?"""
47473,Lisa,"do it for an hour, hour and a half."
46202,Lisa,someone will. i'm gonna crack the bully code.
51412,Lisa,we'll explain it!
42994,Lisa,"you don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
49034,Lisa,i would strongly support that measure.
47289,Lisa,"bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!"
44552,Lisa,ah! dad! doesn't this car have seat belts?
47889,Lisa,it's so embarrassing mom is making us wear clothes from goodwill.
41951,Lisa,did you hear that maggie? another baby in the house.
49784,Lisa,"what is this, tough love?"
41692,Lisa,"i see he touched you, too."
49037,Lisa,"hey dad, that's the singer you used to manage!"
43841,Lisa,"shh, mom. dad needs our support."
44324,Lisa,me! me!
50692,Lisa,"i know it's futile, but i must again point out there is no dragon."
46692,Lisa,"come on, guys. we're gonna be late."
45769,Lisa,yeah. did you even call about that messenger job?
46268,Lisa,dr. bushwell!
42308,Lisa,bart.
50063,Lisa,"mr. zuckerberg, i'm lisa, and this is nelson."
43261,Lisa,"wow. now that i know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?"
52001,Lisa,"what about my cat, snowball?"
51820,Lisa,is it called the cooling tower because there's--
49874,Lisa,"yes, it is fitting."
42185,Lisa,"oh yeah? who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""president clown""?"
46975,Lisa,"aw, that's so sweet."
43066,Lisa,"eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. he will make the next few hours a living hell."
42962,Lisa,"dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
48611,Lisa,"...and so my proud people were nearly destroyed by the warfare, disease, and greed of the invading europeans."
44265,Lisa,"wow, ""trucker's choice."" that is so sweet."
43594,Lisa,here we go again!
43830,Lisa,"dad? please just drive the car, dad."
43265,Lisa,"wow. what else did you do, dad?"
48304,Lisa,fox flew me out here to bring you back. they flew me on frito lay's air force yum!
51445,Lisa,shut up!
50696,Lisa,i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
43813,Lisa,it doesn't work.
47286,Lisa,"no, it doesn't."
52415,Lisa,two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
41740,Lisa,"how's it going, bart?"
49464,Lisa,well? did you get it?
42022,Lisa,"well, i would like to see what all the fuss is about."
47753,Lisa,we're trapped!
43409,Lisa,"they have simpson d.n.a. it could've come from any of us. except you, since you're a bouvier."
51726,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
46426,Lisa,"well, the yaqui indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
48435,Lisa,you could make a great chef someday.
46960,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen. tonight, i'd like to harangue you about the plight of--"
51258,Lisa,"no, this is good."
44559,Lisa,"bart, did you hear that?"
41884,Lisa,peace on earth.
47570,Lisa,you probably do this all the time! this whole family is built on a tissue of lies and romance!
51657,Lisa,this house is haunted!
44446,Lisa,"mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!"
50801,Lisa,can i please be alone?
41975,Lisa,daaaaad! you're not listening to me.
45891,Lisa,"awww. / oh, no."
47188,Lisa,the flower's starting to open!
50808,Lisa,"don't ""monster"" me."
45281,Lisa,"yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --"
47920,Lisa,what is it that they have that keeps snowball coming back to their house?
47001,Lisa,i'm a little tired.
49910,Lisa,a beached whale.
50241,Lisa,"mmm-mm, that is some sweet pig meat. but as for christmas trees... i used to love them -- until last year, when i went tree shopping with mom..."
49422,Lisa,the test is almost over and i haven't done a thing. i've blown my whole future.
44582,Lisa,"did you get ""emma?"" did you get ""emma?"" did ya? did ya? did ya? huh?"
44240,Lisa,hi. how are you?
50006,Lisa,i can hear you.
49579,Lisa,"caitlin, hi! do a reading at your bat mitzvah? a sheynam dank!"
51936,Lisa,why don't you go see grampa?
50890,Lisa,huh. two queens. that's a great start.
48531,Lisa,"well moe, i guess we're friends again."
44619,Lisa,we toil in the fields and he rides around in a rolls royce?
49900,Lisa,"dad, while i agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle."
50748,Lisa,this group is adapting children's classics for the stage to entertain generations of survivors.
51965,Lisa,ew! how'd you get a name like that?
50672,Lisa,"mom, i'm sorry i'm late! no excuse, i just forgot all about you. huh? i'm not sure that patch really represents who i am right now."
42161,Lisa,perhaps i'm not making myself clear. i think you should reconsider.
44336,Lisa,"that came from baboon county, u.s.a.!"
44620,Lisa,he's wrong! you're wrong! the whole damn system is wrong!
49123,Lisa,"uh, mom? we've got a code four."
50014,Lisa,thursday we got attacked by bees.
43360,Lisa,good-bye.
52056,Lisa,"bart, i have something to say that's gonna bother me if i don't say it... it's good to see you."
44505,Lisa,don't give up! i'm sure we'll find something!
44288,Lisa,but we didn't do that badly. we collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
48849,Lisa,"tarantulas! i'll save you, baby burps-a-lot!"
50500,Lisa,"halloween is over, which means america, it's time to start your christmas shopping. infuse our stagnant economy with dollars you don't really have."
42677,Lisa,this biography of bart came out awfully quickly. it's not even about him.
46603,Lisa,why don't you read to us now?
45994,Lisa,"oh, i'll show you."
48072,Lisa,i know. i'm sorry.
45337,Lisa,"well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like christo."
51457,Lisa,you've been changing your dna?!
41925,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to do this."
46400,Lisa,do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
48007,Lisa,"yeah, the templates had a great run. but we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
47613,Lisa,we've become pariahs! in the last two hours i've gotten one thousand hate spams.
47491,Lisa,"c'mon, c'mon..."
46399,Lisa,"it's not fair, dad. why should an animal die just because you and moe are fighting?"
48654,Lisa,stop the tour!
42749,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons. my advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
50662,Lisa,"yeah, yeah, okay, second closest."
42355,Lisa,"dad, hide your shame!"
41914,Lisa,"wait, dad, i've got something for you."
51886,Lisa,"no, me!"
50029,Lisa,"if you need me, i'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
50968,Lisa,"every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities."
46493,Lisa,"i'm serious, make with the pony."
42295,Lisa,"ooh / meow / dad, stop you're embarrassing us / stop please."
43729,Lisa,"hey, the comic book store's still open!"
47641,Lisa,"hmm, how about feature columnist?"
46026,Lisa,"sir, have you no shame?"
46422,Lisa,"mom, i believe you."
42492,Lisa,excuse me.
45354,Lisa,here you go. make sure you get into every crevice.
44476,Lisa,well... football's not really my thing.
47232,Lisa,i could join past presidents. like otto... or krusty!
48838,Lisa,"fiber-optic cable, uranium two thirty-five, two tickets to ""avenue q"", seven billion body bags..."
44589,Lisa,we can't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast.
50525,Lisa,goorsha!
51232,Lisa,we thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide...
45559,Lisa,are those real cobras?
49019,Lisa,"i'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital."
47788,Lisa,yes...
49017,Lisa,a sturgeon is a fish.
43619,Lisa,"no, grampa, don't!"
48414,Lisa,"i'm so glad you could all come. i'll be reading to you from ""the origin of species"" by charles darwin."
45336,Lisa,i'm sick of him already.
42423,Lisa,"i propose to determine the answer to the question: ""is my brother dumber than a hamster?"""
48638,Lisa,you asked to see me?
49700,Lisa,"belt is by twizzler, vest courtesy of nelson, tights are by hello kitty..."
44267,Lisa,"and so handsome! bart, i just love him!"
48285,Lisa,they take in animals from the movies and tv that aren't cute anymore.
49221,Lisa,one more word!
48508,Lisa,moe!
51652,Lisa,making fun of someone's clothes. how original.
42178,Lisa,i am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
46510,Lisa,"fine, i'll talk like this."
47268,Lisa,skinner betrayed me!
51448,Lisa,tomato!
49680,Lisa,"hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
41928,Lisa,"i mean you, you dummy."
47378,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure god responds to threats and intimidation."
44992,Lisa,"oh, i don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
44154,Lisa,where are the dice?
41709,Lisa,no!
45144,Lisa,"hey, dad, that light says, ""check engine."""
50613,Lisa,"you know, symbols can often rile people up. the swastika... the new york yankees logo..."
47439,Lisa,bart will make your bed for a week.
47258,Lisa,excuse me? i was wondering if i should read what i just signed.
49179,Lisa,"it's me, you idiot."
45958,Lisa,what's going on here?
41716,Lisa,that music always sends a chill down my spine.
42025,Lisa,i think dallas is a mortal lock.
43359,Lisa,i don't want you to go!
42948,Lisa,"yeah. ""dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
51133,Lisa,i'm gonna put all my stuffed animals on it!
51447,Lisa,i say engineered po-tay-to / you say engineered po-tah-to... potato!
43391,Lisa,could not!
43904,Lisa,this is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
45524,Lisa,they must be starting a new civilization on mars with our best and brightest.
51277,Lisa,they sell your posters...workout dvds...and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.
50002,Lisa,victory for the middle child!
44358,Lisa,"that's how they want you to feel. but if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
45937,Lisa,"it's okay, they're gone now. you can..."
41916,Lisa,"oh look. you haven't touched your salt lick. num num, good salt lick."
49998,Lisa,"i'm just gonna chill out with a little ""this american life."""
45378,Lisa,unbelievable! we're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
50047,Lisa,"let's see, i could help someone in any impoverished area on earth. bangladesh... bolivia... east springfield?!"
42141,Lisa,"well, according to ""eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. so i guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse."
47119,Lisa,you're not listening!
42652,Lisa,"but dad, if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of florida, i'll be the laughing stock of the whole school."
41647,Lisa,i have a paw!
50268,Lisa,could we hurry this up? i am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
43783,Lisa,"but bart, that'll cost a fortune."
44919,Lisa,unbelievable.
45806,Lisa,"bart, we need that to win the contest."
46600,Lisa,"mom, you're hurting me."
45590,Lisa,the phone's not even plugged in!
49192,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
43505,Lisa,"wow, that'd be great!"
49235,Lisa,i... i made them into a crossword.
46271,Lisa,buzz off.
50798,Lisa,"please, take your time."
44875,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
49161,Lisa,really? so what else is in the news?
44290,Lisa,"dad, if you just drink one more, i'll have a full bag."
47197,Lisa,a world without death...
47265,Lisa,i would have gone with you.
47455,Lisa,rice? why not caviar?
43256,Lisa,"i know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them."
44907,Lisa,playin' hot wheels.
48483,Lisa,this is a valuable skill. people might even pay you to build things for them.
48489,Lisa,"dad, no! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!"
49557,Lisa,"look at this: springfield elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."
49705,Lisa,more...
50186,Lisa,"that school is so great! teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. is mom gonna come up and say goodnight?"
42623,Lisa,"well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. may i suggest ""good-natured doormat?"""
50180,Lisa,an academy! i'm attending an academy!
46487,Lisa,"oh, i'll send you an email greeting card."
47867,Lisa,"bart, don't worry."
45934,Lisa,george cauldron? maybe he can fix me up with ed ladle.
48693,Lisa,"dad, where'd you get that outfit?"
50189,Lisa,i see what happened. there was no scholarship. they said i could attend if you did all their laundry. i can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge.
45561,Lisa,what a neat idea!
50907,Lisa,oh my god! you won the pot? you must have nearly a million dollars! i can go to college and live like a kennedy.
43900,Lisa,being myself didn't work... being someone else didn't work... maybe i just wasn't meant to have friends.
51110,Lisa,maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.
51513,Lisa,everyone does that.
43977,Lisa,"oh, mom, please! you can make this my birthday and christmas presents!"
49812,Lisa,i must know!
44461,Lisa,no...
49643,Lisa,why would willie do that?
43927,Lisa,tiny little people!
49560,Lisa,"mom, that's brilliant! we could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! and where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers."
46204,Lisa,it's hard to miss the cameras.
49350,Lisa,i'd love to!
43748,Lisa,i still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom work.
47769,Lisa,ow!
50702,Lisa,"well, i did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
47676,Lisa,"dad, you should listen to him. he's a man of science and you can barely read!"
51863,Lisa,"i think bart's stupid again, mom."
44375,Lisa,duh! a challenge i could do.
46774,Lisa,"if not for guns, poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
46911,Lisa,"dad! that information is all wrong! maggie's a baby, not my best friend! you don't know anything about me!"
49222,Lisa,"""singer of yentl"", thirteen letters... um..."
51060,Lisa,this class doesn't give demerits.
45356,Lisa,"picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
46625,Lisa,huh. getting kind of hot around here.
41871,Lisa,we're gonna hit him where it hurts. right in the judaica.
47608,Lisa,this whole morning has been wonderful. too wonderful.
43810,Lisa,bart's room.
46928,Lisa,"aw... life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, dad. i feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been."
42590,Lisa,"please, bart, i've seen your stupid shemp."
45410,Lisa,"no, we should fix things here. if we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish."
43092,Lisa,"c'mon, bart. they're gonna pamper us. not literally, of course."
47534,Lisa,"your early movies are timeless classics. please, mr. curtis. go back to what made your first films so great."
52101,Lisa,"maggie, wanna watch ""the happy little elves"" again?"
51654,Lisa,bart! i found a portal back to earth.
43949,Lisa,yayyy!
50628,Lisa,"trust me, i've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. anyway, i ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. that's what kids do, right? hang out at the mall together. but when i went over..."
48339,Lisa,unless the captain is attentive / we'll all be crushed by a huge wave...
49876,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
46627,Lisa,"look, this story is more interesting than you think. it starts with hamlet's father getting murdered."
52071,Lisa,"come on, bart. the tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito."
42041,Lisa,that's alright. i think i'll just hit the hay.
45902,Lisa,none of us had ever sung before. but mr. geffen believed in us.
49757,Lisa,"please, at least try the tennis game."
48953,Lisa,i'm saying this is worse than a million a-minuses!
46255,Lisa,no they don't. they--
52310,Lisa,"dad, i think that's pretty spurious."
47884,Lisa,"if we can just get to the delta airlines gold medallion lounge, they can't get in without spending frequent flyer miles."
45615,Lisa,she cleaned out the attic!
45135,Lisa,"aww. way to go, ralph."
44959,Lisa,"oh, then, at the risk of being unpopular, i think i'm gonna have to say..."
45713,Lisa,"mom, i think you might be developing a gambling problem."
44631,Lisa,"yeah, mom, c'mon. you let us stay up to watch troy mcclure in such other bible epics as ""david vs. super goliath"" and ""suddenly, last supper."""
45735,Lisa,"oooh, there's ulysses s. grant, babe ruth ben franklin..."
48390,Lisa,"well, whatever the answer is, i'm glad i'm a girl and i'm glad i'm good at math. now enjoy your stupid flautist."
47637,Lisa,"""elegy for geezer rock:"" / ""postcard image, thing to see, / to think of springfield is to think of thee. / what thoughts be-pass a'hind thy mien? / why sky art blue, why trees art green? and what, pray tell, did thine eyes see? / perchance, old friend, they gazed at me. / brought low by nature's oafish hand, / thou crush-ed our reviewing stand / and twixt thy stones glimpsed i the truth: / all things must pass -- thy face, my youth."""
47699,Lisa,hey look! the new ovenfresh flour bag!
52523,Lisa,not a good time.
44569,Lisa,turn into the skid!
42698,Lisa,awww.
43054,Lisa,"okay. then i'm going to start kicking air like this. and if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault."
51019,Lisa,"okay, i also know of a puppet show..."
47832,Lisa,i have a real suggestion.
51999,Lisa,"yeah, i suppose so. night mom."
44890,Lisa,see the isis exhibit. but the museum's closed.
43395,Lisa,"actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is. the rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
47739,Lisa,did you know back in high school that she'd be such a star?
47088,Lisa,"bart, i just realized -- we both want the same thing: darkness. and we can get it if we work together, with my brain and your... your... assistance."
42088,Lisa,shove it.
48986,Lisa,"i based my costume on the books, not the movies."
52202,Lisa,twelfth hole.
48479,Lisa,this place is looking a little run down.
44854,Lisa,"i'm sorry, it's just that on the school bus--"
44605,Lisa,"why did you shudder just now, mom?"
47452,Lisa,ice?
48441,Lisa,"why didn't you tell him it was an accident? it was an accident, right? michael?"
42385,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
41601,Lisa,really?
41959,Lisa,"dad, can i have some money to buy bart a birthday present?"
43439,Lisa,we give up.
48013,Lisa,it's the title of the movie.
52335,Lisa,"hello, mr. powell"
42439,Lisa,come gather 'round children / it's high-time ye learns / 'bout a hero named homer / and a devil named burns / we'll march till we drop / the girls and the fellas / will fight till the death or else fold like umbrellas
42135,Lisa,"they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. as you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
42134,Lisa,according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
44882,Lisa,"dad, grab onto it!"
46651,Lisa,"while you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there ronaldo is waiting to be found."
45638,Lisa,"oop, the cheese isn't quite melted. let me just pop it back in the..."
45146,Lisa,because they discovered gold right over there--
44428,Lisa,that one!
44723,Lisa,like you!!
43802,Lisa,does the whole town have to hear about this?
44869,Lisa,"well, um, i'm kind of lost. can you tell me where i am?"
44757,Lisa,an earring? how rebellious in a conformist sort of way.
51925,Lisa,then what am i?
43951,Lisa,oooh! aaah! ohhh!
43521,Lisa,"mom, dad -- martin died at school today!"
46236,Lisa,my teacher said i need cupcakes. cupcakes to learn.
51115,Lisa,"oh. okay. if you'll excuse me, i have to go think of you in a different light."
41984,Lisa,you mean you made a bet?
51094,Lisa,"your honor, i think we've seen enough. i have demolished the prosecution's claims and made the prosecutor sweat through two shirts."
50311,Lisa,it was wrong of me to play goddess!
46224,Lisa,but why do the brawny prey on the brainy? is it jealousy?
49150,Lisa,"so the centipede says: ""i'm goin'! i'm goin'! ...i'm just puttin' on my shoes!"""
51227,Lisa,then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...
48456,Lisa,that is the most unfair...
44422,Lisa,i am three and three eighths!
43000,Lisa,what about grampa?
45265,Lisa,"ugh, this is not gonna work."
45297,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was it?"
43806,Lisa,you already put him in a home.
47240,Lisa,"i'm not that cool, i don't wear jeans / i've polished an apple or two / but every grade that i grubbed, i grubbed it for you... / so call me bookworm / but i'll never squirm, when there's work to be done / yes i'll take my lunch at my desk / while you're all outside having fun..."
47541,Lisa,but i'm eight years old!
43536,Lisa,dad--
48786,Lisa,i'm not sure brockman's out of the woods yet. there are a lot of religious watch-dog groups out there... keeping the world safe from the horror of free expression.
48725,Lisa,i can't believe you listened to this magazine. it's a larry flynt publication!
49226,Lisa,"fruit loops? that's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"""
49054,Lisa,don't worry. i called some animal activists who can help us get in. i'll just give the signal. milk is murder!
42659,Lisa,what's the point of all these precautions? i've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
50503,Lisa,"my science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on july 15, 9789."
52382,Lisa,"dad, it's just a dumb mud puddle."
42485,Lisa,"i guess nobody likes the truth, huh grampa."
41885,Lisa,peace on earth.
42583,Lisa,"dad, do you notice anything strange?"
43915,Lisa,so i have two brothers?
44879,Lisa,"hang on, dad!"
49550,Lisa,i'm a big girl! i'm a big girl!
50100,Lisa,"wow, i'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
50759,Lisa,i just want closure.
42094,Lisa,stupid hoover... thinks she's so smart.
42069,Lisa,"no mom, it counts as a hit. dad just won the game."
52277,Lisa,"please, dad."
42414,Lisa,i've grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with anabolic steroids.
45890,Lisa,"c'mon, becky. tell us your big news."
42905,Lisa,perfect!
51406,Lisa,the people of sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
42911,Lisa,"i'm really sorry about what i did, allison. it's no shame being second to you."
43030,Lisa,snowball fight!
42405,Lisa,but couldn't we just give in to the british?
41936,Lisa,you should smell his room.
43480,Lisa,it's tomato soup served ice cold!
45997,Lisa,not so fast!
44816,Lisa,i can't believe they cancelled us for this stupid...
46276,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
41997,Lisa,i'd bet my entire college fund on it.
47450,Lisa,"maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. c'mon."
42561,Lisa,we stopped five minutes ago.
47597,Lisa,"now up, the case of simpson v. simpson."
45772,Lisa,i love it!
50680,Lisa,"grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?"
46010,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll be right back."
42794,Lisa,otto!
51992,Lisa,aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
52164,Lisa,"yeah, you throw like me."
44773,Lisa,mo-om...
42145,Lisa,"dad, you know you won."
41706,Lisa,"i'm glad i'm not crying because i would hate for you to think that what i'm about to say is based on emotion. but you, sir, are a baboon!"
48481,Lisa,i never wanna go back to that mall. there were eels in the photo booth!
43472,Lisa,ah... miss hoover? i don't think i can dissect an animal. i think it's wrong.
47770,Lisa,spitballs!
51177,Lisa,yay!
49723,Lisa,i do! it enrages me!
52027,Lisa,"yes, you are."
48764,Lisa,"martin, anything?"
47185,Lisa,"c'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower."
45251,Lisa,america's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
42216,Lisa,nope.
44053,Lisa,"well, i'm really not thinking about that now."
44353,Lisa,all i want is a chance to prove myself.
42458,Lisa,"i wrote this for you, dad."
49600,Lisa,"little did they know, their lives are about to be changed forever by a wicked queen."
44728,Lisa,"ah, they just came for the buffalo wings. but you really got through to me."
52316,Lisa,"hi, dad. i think stealing cable is wrong. so i'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. it's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. thank you for your time."
41859,Lisa,"krusty, please continue."
48160,Lisa,huh?
45001,Lisa,surprise!
46148,Lisa,what does it mean?
42329,Lisa,don't you mean three million dollars?
47299,Lisa,"mom, you said macbeth!"
49276,Lisa,um... i'm also returning this kitten calendar.
41765,Lisa,"meditations on turning eight, by lisa simpson. i had a cat named snowball -- she died, she died! mom said she was sleeping -- she lied, she lied! why oh why is my cat dead? couldn't that chrysler hit me, instead? i had a hamster named snuffy -- he died, --"
41961,Lisa,"quit it, dad!"
41786,Lisa,hmm...
45126,Lisa,"stop it! i cheated! cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated!"
42393,Lisa,"hmm, i think you should give that a rest, ralph. chief wiggum, how did you ever get these tickets?"
49274,Lisa,"oh, dad."
43914,Lisa,momdadwesawsomethingintheatticand --
50825,Lisa,lisa simpson / lisa simpson...
52365,Lisa,"eight. thanks, dad."
45996,Lisa,"wow, what a view."
43416,Lisa,stop! don't shoot my dad! he's innocent. he wouldn't hurt a fly!
52455,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom, we request the pleasure of your company... no... mr. bergstrom, if you're not doing anything this friday... no... mr. bergstrom, do you like pork chops... oh no, of course you wouldn't..."
52314,Lisa,should i have my father arrested?
42127,Lisa,i'se just jammin' with you.
51218,Lisa,"but wait, wait, wait! what is this?"
48023,Lisa,"hey, i won four free movie tickets! and it starts in half an hour!"
52279,Lisa,"please, dad."
41635,Lisa,that'll learn `im to bust my tomater.
47219,Lisa,"dad, the word's ""desert."" and those farmers are suffering!"
47829,Lisa,"the way i was raised, by mom, i learned the truth can't be swept under the rug."
45165,Lisa,"why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?"
46384,Lisa,that's my brother.
51487,Lisa,i've tried to give pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat:
44236,Lisa,"hold on, bart. everything's going to be just fine. i'm going to get you to a doctor. he will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family. happy, happy, happy family."
46555,Lisa,"you know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
48950,Lisa,oh my god!
48245,Lisa,you're a smash g. k.!
50888,Lisa,"new low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... i'm just gonna log right out."
42270,Lisa,up-up-up. when i'm done.
47379,Lisa,"dad, what are all those cuts?"
46659,Lisa,i bet maggie would like one.
50492,Lisa,okay: a--
45483,Lisa,i'll help you write a new review if you just let me use the bathroom!
48493,Lisa,do you feel bad about what you did?
42358,Lisa,"all right, mom. i promise you will never be billed for another call. bobby sherman..."
52520,Lisa,this is it. i'm going into the ultranet to save my daughter.
48998,Lisa,well... she danced into her seventies.
42505,Lisa,"mrs. glick, who killed all those rats in your basement?"
47660,Lisa,"stupid burns, cuts off my power, lowers my credit rating..."
51187,Lisa,three awesome kids and a life of regret!
49658,Lisa,possum?!
42138,Lisa,you've gained thirteen pounds.
49055,Lisa,"yeah, it's my code name. this is compost. and this is solarpanel."
42622,Lisa,"ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. you've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society."
52506,Lisa,there is no cure for zombie-ism.
47375,Lisa,"coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake?"
46782,Lisa,break into the bank and snatch that dough...
45059,Lisa,dad! push exit!
48394,Lisa,"i'm lisa, i'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- i'm your favorite."
49940,Lisa,"dad, no!"
44345,Lisa,where's miss hoover?
50352,Lisa,what if you just taught me one trick?
51173,Lisa,iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.
45689,Lisa,mom! bart's making faces at me. i think.
43656,Lisa,"no. we're looking for this man, krusty the clown."
46205,Lisa,why does the school need to watch us all the time?
48395,Lisa,"well, talk to me in a week."
47111,Lisa,"silver bells, silver bells..."
44987,Lisa,"mom, you can't possibly believe that."
51666,Lisa,this is clearly a fracking site. how are they keeping people away?
48802,Lisa,and at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
49967,Lisa,it's better to just fit in with the crowd.
41745,Lisa,zee-boo. zee-boo.
52494,Lisa,the old milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack.
43393,Lisa,we don't have an outhouse.
45679,Lisa,what have you got so far?
42242,Lisa,"before i sing the national anthem, i'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
42651,Lisa,"dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight."
44243,Lisa,"oh, bart, i'm so sorry. this is all like a bad dream..."
45613,Lisa,gary...
49691,Lisa,change it! change it!
44103,Lisa,me too.
45292,Lisa,"dad, wake up!"
50752,Lisa,"hey, up here! you've gotta see this!"
51336,Lisa,you got it.
43098,Lisa,"mom, can we talk to you?"
51316,Lisa,my new best friend isn't what i thought. she's a... republican.
45229,Lisa,mom! bart took what i said and turned it into an insult!
42967,Lisa,"i don't like him either mom, but i'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
44658,Lisa,we should be safe in here.
45167,Lisa,"is he, mom? you can tell me."
47510,Lisa,okay. i'll just stay calm and approach this scientifically.
46789,Lisa,"do you remember how you got home last night, dad?"
42379,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
46066,Lisa,"wow, mom got a laugh."
47857,Lisa,"hey, this really works."
50334,Lisa,"aw, come on, bart, it's fun!"
50677,Lisa,"mom can't appreciate the kind of boy nick is, because although i love dad, he's a completely different creature."
42548,Lisa,"no, someone who didn't deserve it."
45148,Lisa,"besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you."
51156,Lisa,that's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. we start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
51506,Lisa,what!?
46638,Lisa,awww.
49384,Lisa,"goodbye, juliet."
45855,Lisa,it's me!
50813,Lisa,"look at me! you did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. it was like a great sneeze. and now i can say what's good about me. and i can say it as lisa simpson! just not that loud."
45649,Lisa,"oh, couldn't be better."
45409,Lisa,someone should stand up to them.
43796,Lisa,why me? yuk! i smell like a sandwich.
44830,Lisa,"so we transplant the town. we're just gonna trash the new springfield, too."
51485,Lisa,"okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy."
49322,Lisa,i'm going home. give me the keys to my bike lock.
49905,Lisa,"dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still."
48591,Lisa,"frère jacques, frère jacques / dormez-vous, dormez-vous..."
43017,Lisa,you gotta give her up.
41771,Lisa,"although i am aware you are looking at me, i would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
44548,Lisa,"oh, don't listen to my husband. he's just an idiot. now, i'm a veterinarian and i need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. is that permitted?"
46663,Lisa,it smells like the art teacher's office.
41619,Lisa,"eh, forget it."
49880,Lisa,"no, the ants are the farmers."
51053,Lisa,"but i am playing! i'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph, climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme."
50408,Lisa,"bart, this isn't a photograph. i'm not just gonna paint you into--"
43176,Lisa,how could you forget? they had signs posted all over the library.
50540,Lisa,he gets four and i only get two?! no fair!
51272,Lisa,"look, while i'd like to help, i'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances."
45418,Lisa,excellent. now next week is our state of the city address. has everyone finalized their proposals?
46364,Lisa,five-minutes-more-ious!
44275,Lisa,"hey, this park is great! how come we never take santa's little helper here?"
47116,Lisa,or we could go to walter gropius's bauhaus village?
52260,Lisa,all right!
42117,Lisa,she's wonderful. i could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
44201,Lisa,"mag-gie, if you come down, i'll give you some more cof-fee."
45948,Lisa,"here we are. ""in a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers."""
45287,Lisa,bleagghhh!
43482,Lisa,stop it! stop it! don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
46178,Lisa,"dad, i'm so proud of you. if you need some inspiration, here's a book of mike farrell's core beliefs."
44755,Lisa,"eh, sort of."
42710,Lisa,that's it! i'm calling the company!
51484,Lisa,"dad, give me your phone. i need to look at the pictures again!"
50608,Lisa,looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.
46492,Lisa,"thanks, mom. hey, where's my pony?"
50915,Lisa,mmm! tasty! love the texture. what is it?
51630,Lisa,that's all i wanted: a tiny bit of control.
44364,Lisa,"bart, i got a cassette from mom and dad! i thought we could listen to it together."
44374,Lisa,"i can't do this, bart. i'm not strong enough."
45077,Lisa,"dad, do you mind? your feet are really close to my potato."
49396,Lisa,homer simpson.
48544,Lisa,"so, how was nelson's party?"
49584,Lisa,"look, can you please, please, help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in? it's what half your songs are about."
51333,Lisa,i'll see you later.
47135,Lisa,"i look forward to it. ha ha ha ha, i hate you."
43514,Lisa,like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
50821,Lisa,some day i'll design a solar car!
49111,Lisa,"well, i uh..."
43703,Lisa,general washington?!
46471,Lisa,"hey, i'm a buddhist!"
41634,Lisa,oh my god! my brother's my best friend.
49224,Lisa,now gimme my license! give everyone their license!
46563,Lisa,"bart, this girl is in love with you. think about it."
47839,Lisa,"well, that's the end of dad's wedding business."
42554,Lisa,"oh, no! dad's been drugged!"
50775,Lisa,i'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.
47355,Lisa,"obviously, yes."
48561,Lisa,"what? no! i mean, that's a given. but also, the malibu stacy pony beach party set with sparkle sand. it's sold out everywhere."
45591,Lisa,you people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
43441,Lisa,you're gonna be bart flanders.
41947,Lisa,"my jump rope broke, but i just tied it back together."
50187,Lisa,mom?
48732,Lisa,"but mom, the lifeguards have to know."
47875,Lisa,"what about your pet iguana, jub-jub?"
49022,Lisa,"well, since you cared enough to apply peer pressure..."
47075,Lisa,hey.
46747,Lisa,what was that?
47359,Lisa,her eyes aren't focused.
46848,Lisa,"dad, i'm telling you, truman wins."
45678,Lisa,"how can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? the bucket came off dad's head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand."
48882,Lisa,"and ""wes doobner's world famous family style rib huts"" is actually an anagram!"
47471,Lisa,"it's called goth, eternally clueless one. my new name is ravencrow never-smiles."
47411,Lisa,"well, at least they're not fighting."
48311,Lisa,"no! wait! wait! bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!"
48683,Lisa,no! should i attach it for you?
51585,Lisa,what's the advice?
43448,Lisa,"bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. for five dollars, milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
48081,Lisa,i've changed my mind! can you please open the gate?
49463,Lisa,so many rings! but which one is the key to finding the gem?
41804,Lisa,"okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
50597,Lisa,"hm, they're selling off all the old tv relics."
51388,Lisa,what? n.c. wyeth! these are book illustrations!
49921,Lisa,i'll catch up with you guys in a little bit.
46192,Lisa,how about jazz? do you like jazz?
46362,Lisa,"there must be someone who can use a man around the house, even if he's slightly homicidal."
49073,Lisa,i am a born filmmaker!
45210,Lisa,the renaissance.
44007,Lisa,please?
41816,Lisa,"""and who did i see taking a bribe, but the ""honorable"" bob arnold. but don't worry, congressman, i'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. and this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none."""
45132,Lisa,intendent--
51151,Lisa,you're siding with record companies?
44579,Lisa,what?
41971,Lisa,"hey, stop that!"
42726,Lisa,"but you are malibu stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. i'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it."
44606,Lisa,ewww!
42589,Lisa,oh my god!
45944,Lisa,"i kinda wish i hadn't freed their leader and, you know... doomed mankind."
48096,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be fine. let's get some breakfast.
49168,Lisa,see ya!
50782,Lisa,"y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that milhouse brought it to our attention."
43787,Lisa,"bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove milhouse, nelson, and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and bart's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong."
43564,Lisa,"all right, we don't need the dryer."
43373,Lisa,it's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
43757,Lisa,i'm going after him!
49406,Lisa,"i was describing beautiful fish, bart!"
51941,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
42316,Lisa,"bart, that's gross!"
42222,Lisa,"i meant because they both win all the time, mom."
43542,Lisa,"mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
48753,Lisa,i already read it.
45211,Lisa,"that's not really you, dad. he's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name."
43180,Lisa,"dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
45116,Lisa,keep the change.
52322,Lisa,go for it dad!
47830,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. after all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"
50973,Lisa,well i'm glad you're not upset. all my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
52062,Lisa,oh no!
43282,Lisa,he's giving them a bath!
45137,Lisa,"thank you. i know this giant check is very important to everyone here. but, what's even more important is the truth."
42023,Lisa,put me down.
46930,Lisa,why did you do that?
46195,Lisa,would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard work?
43706,Lisa,"oh, let me help you, george washington, i still want to help you."
47967,Lisa,there's no way i'm gonna beat her.
48399,Lisa,"well, now it's time for my summer activity. you promised we could go to a museum."
45543,Lisa,"""tomacco?"" that's pretty clever, dad. i mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
52259,Lisa,there she is!
50252,Lisa,this is the last time i bring these two to bed at the same time.
50638,Lisa,"no, that is not true! i--"
43503,Lisa,"you don't eat cheese, apu?"
52080,Lisa,"awww, dad."
44560,Lisa,mom! make him stop!
45567,Lisa,and why aren't i at school?
49448,Lisa,"mother superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?"
46521,Lisa,only on mars.
51192,Lisa,bart! why is the dad i always wished for creeping me out?
48062,Lisa,"i believe in science and reality, not ghosts and monsters!"
45093,Lisa,yes!
49365,Lisa,it's better if you don't.
48080,Lisa,mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows. but i'm gonna conquer my fears... tonight.
45338,Lisa,"no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic."
43741,Lisa,bart! look at this!
49270,Lisa,new york times crossword editor will shortz!
45940,Lisa,go on! swim to freedom! go!
50216,Lisa,"yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him."

52293,Lisa,no!
46983,Lisa,i-m-p...
47062,Lisa,"dad, my life lacks direction!"
42705,Lisa,"it's not funny, bart! millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! that they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
50650,Lisa,"friend, friend, awaiting reply, friend..."
50660,Lisa,yes i did. now i'm going to bed.
45673,Lisa,"dad, bart, i played a horrible trick on you and i'm really sorry. you don't have leprosy. it's just oatmeal."
45751,Lisa,"yes. yes you were. now, in conclusion, my administration will focus on the three r's: reading, 'riting and refilling the ocean. thank you very much."
41778,Lisa,"wait, dad!"
43069,Lisa,"sorry, dad. we do believe in you. we really do."
44679,Lisa,"dad, we're the visitors."
51134,Lisa,"all right, get comfy."
47866,Lisa,"he's building a me! well, i mean, it's a little american-primitive... but who am i to dismiss outsider art? it shows he misses me... and this is the third thing!"
44307,Lisa,"wow, even i didn't know he was so committed to recycling! see? i told you mr. burns has changed. see?"
50701,Lisa,"it's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, wikileaks is right over there."
42435,Lisa,do you think you can get the dental plan back?
50575,Lisa,you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
44495,Lisa,why would a motorboat have a mast?
41648,Lisa,"oh my gosh, i've entered the body of our cat!"
45391,Lisa,"hi, mr. flanders, i see you're reading the newspaper."

51911,Lisa,keep your greasy mitts outta there.
46630,Lisa,"i need to call janey, but i can't get a dial tone."
50840,Lisa,"all right, broadway's too expensive, the museums are over-curated -- but shakespeare in the park is tonight, and the tickets are free!"
48421,Lisa,"i just don't think religion should be taught in our schools, any more than you'd want scientists teaching at the church."
44719,Lisa,"wesley, get mama's pryin' bar."
46064,Lisa,are you really gonna drink that?
48963,Lisa,exactly.
49657,Lisa,"well, there's only one game we can play in the car over and over and over again. ""bonk it."""
47961,Lisa,ow!
47486,Lisa,"well, i'm sure a lot of great people have started with less."
44050,Lisa,"well, i guess this is it..."
45286,Lisa,da-ad.
46581,Lisa,we also represent billy joel.
50767,Lisa,i just hope you're gonna take this seriously.
51264,Lisa,you've presented me with quite a conundrum.
42969,Lisa,that sounds like sideshow bob!
44654,Lisa,"stop! leave milhouse alone! help me out here, bart."
50015,Lisa,friday morning andrew lloyd weber and elaine stritch helped us make wallets.
41998,Lisa,"dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous."

50119,Lisa,what am i gonna do? i need a pinch-runner with speed!
49109,Lisa,it's just a cat.
49961,Lisa,everyone was mean to sally. she was too well-rounded. she felt cornered. they wouldn't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social.
49182,Lisa,something about this just doesn't seem right.
43083,Lisa,"hey, hey, hey! stop it! stop it! why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? haven't you heard of occam's razor? ""the simplest explanation is probably the correct one."""
43081,Lisa,"oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
50581,Lisa,krappy the klunk.
46138,Lisa,all we can do is play our very best.
48754,Lisa,"wait, milhouse -- hold your position. something doesn't add up."
47350,Lisa,"dad, what you saw was ""a christmas carol."" it was written by charles dickens a hundred and sixty years ago."
47118,Lisa,this whole ranch is appalling. it's built on a legacy of cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.
46181,Lisa,"but mom, the school's right here."
50237,Lisa,why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs?
48909,Lisa,ow!
44492,Lisa,it's the tradition in india.
48049,Lisa,"mom, i got a rash where the reindeer licked me."
43980,Lisa,you mean there's nothing left to clean?
44132,Lisa,ok. / guess so. / sounds good to me./ let's go.
43129,Lisa,daaad!
44450,Lisa,never mind.
48119,Lisa,they're tearing down the pier!
48036,Lisa,catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.

45468,Lisa,"hey! i'm not a ""time burglar!"""
47606,Lisa,great!
49066,Lisa,i'll get your fabrics!
43075,Lisa,"dad, this clears you completely!"
41715,Lisa,"but mom, i want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
45556,Lisa,"i became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited."
48046,Lisa,"look, all i'm saying is, you really should think twice before..."
44360,Lisa,"could someone help me? it's stuck on ""auto-fire""!"
44115,Lisa,any-one but him.
51317,Lisa,what is so funny? they're destroying the world!
47734,Lisa,"you're successful too, mom. you made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise."
51215,Lisa,"please, don't do this, dad! i don't know what horrors you saw in boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
50771,Lisa,"oooh, look at these: ""extreme weddings"" triathlon, zero g... ""tie the knot at the top of mt. everest?!"""
49808,Lisa,"no, the ""underground railroad"" was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to canada. there were no actual trains, and it wasn't under ground."
47774,Lisa,"eww, gross! i bet you can't twist it."
48366,Lisa,so... do you miss having the girls around?
51934,Lisa,"bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. i can't help but think if i had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. i know you can't eat it now, so i'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. ."
42624,Lisa,"no! self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."
44241,Lisa,okay...
48597,Lisa,"milhouse, what's gotten into you?"
44111,Lisa,teach us songs and magic tricks.
49841,Lisa,now what are you up to?
42077,Lisa,"you're wrong, you're wrong! you don't need long fingers to play the blues. the blues come from in here!"
45247,Lisa,deal.
44391,Lisa,"dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
43584,Lisa,bart! bart! what are you doing?! we've got to get out of here!
50184,Lisa,did you get that the pony was actually me?
52269,Lisa,"thursday -- meatloaf night. as it was, is now, and ever shall be."
48842,Lisa,"ha, you missed them! bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now."
42150,Lisa,"and while on ventnor avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa. a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
42100,Lisa,give it to the poor.
42169,Lisa,are you sure that's safe?
42273,Lisa,i think it's wonderful. mom and dad side by side at the power plant. you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
45004,Lisa,"it was thomas edison, dad."
45083,Lisa,much better.
44799,Lisa,they have two.
52487,Lisa,i was worried! i thought i would find...
46372,Lisa,"bart, you saved me."
47278,Lisa,"if we stand together, we are strong!"
47508,Lisa,bart and i will explore the attic until we find their source.
44048,Lisa,i was foolish to think i'd actually changed you. maybe i was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
48033,Lisa,noble idiot! bring in the pie!
48951,Lisa,"hey, i was trying to help him. at worst, i'm an accomplice. i'm an accomplice!"
43109,Lisa,"you don't know what they do there, do you?"
48016,Lisa,"dad, please don't go through with this. all through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."

47549,Lisa,they're going into multi-purpose room b!
42495,Lisa,"then, what should i do?"
43148,Lisa,we're saved!
50137,Lisa,they're just dots in circles.
45044,Lisa,gee!
44025,Lisa,"i feel so stupid, mom. nelson's not right for me at all. and i don't think he ever will be."
51735,Lisa,they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.
45554,Lisa,"ooh, i want to get the ""kr_nk""!"
42372,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
43562,Lisa,"oh, you didn't dumb it down! you said ""rapport!"""
47227,Lisa,"grandma, you'll always be an inspiration to me."
47521,Lisa,"i have to admit, i'll miss having him around."
48949,Lisa,"bart, martin could be seriously hurt, or worse."
48580,Lisa,maybe you killed them all.
52282,Lisa,make it two.
51711,Lisa,look at all these monstrosities.
45819,Lisa,all right! / cool! / lemme see!
49337,Lisa,"i need some candy for a first playdate, but i don't want to come on too strong."
50986,Lisa,twister!
46117,Lisa,"eww, how long has this baking soda been in here?"
45461,Lisa,but my dad can...
42619,Lisa,this is madness. he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
42902,Lisa,i'll do whatever it takes.
49089,Lisa,"okay everyone -- just be yourself. don't look in the camera, pretend i'm not here, and... no toupees..."
48181,Lisa,"when mount vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death."
50910,Lisa,what? you did?
42538,Lisa,what about bob hope? he's been consistently popular for over 50 years.
52116,Lisa,is too.
50057,Lisa,you're quitting school?!
51674,Lisa,how could you sell fracking for mr. burns?
50832,Lisa,hey bart? at least i've got a date!
47500,Lisa,"i don't care what they say, maggie. to me you're brilliant."
42392,Lisa,"well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me."
50336,Lisa,why did i suggest this?
43657,Lisa,"it's hopeless, bart. we've searched up and down these docks, from pier one to that pier 1 by pier seventeen."
50020,Lisa,i can't go home. something happened this week that completely changed me!
43313,Lisa,"i'm glad you're okay, bart."
52004,Lisa,i think she likes my present better.
49220,Lisa,"no, ""martinis""."
51488,Lisa,"peruvian feather grass, an incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of marisol espinoza, the vice president of peru."
44775,Lisa,"bart, get out of my anchor chair."
50904,Lisa,"can't breathe... i've lost, i've lost everything."
44500,Lisa,"oh, but what if they missed something? you have to allow an archeological survey!"
45130,Lisa,but we can't accept that money. it's tainted.
42715,Lisa,"well, i'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
51833,Lisa,"but i really want a pony and i've been really, really good this year."
41853,Lisa,"no, dad, krusty is our guest. your pratfalls and punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
42112,Lisa,"look dad, there's a spot."
44295,Lisa,ha! i'd never help you. you're the worst man in the world.
42855,Lisa,"i'm goin', i'm goin!"
42666,Lisa,"oh, grampa. they pelted you too?"
49716,Lisa,"oh, gross, gross, gross, gross."
43371,Lisa,"mom, i know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
43085,Lisa,dad!
52302,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
51400,Lisa,they're gonna take dad! we gotta do something!
47943,Lisa,"ooh, dalai lamanade!"
47189,Lisa,"dad, the traffic's moving."
50547,Lisa,everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie!
52110,Lisa,"i heard you last night, bart. you prayed for this. now your prayers have been answered. i'm no theologian. i don't know who or what god is exactly. all i know is he's a force more powerful than mom and dad put together and you owe him big."
44571,Lisa,no burglar? / what? / what's he mean?
44870,Lisa,stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
43812,Lisa,"by your logic, i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
48386,Lisa,"that's right, everyone. the best math student in the whole school is a girl!"
42102,Lisa,he is alive. he's wagging his tail.
52232,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing up here? everybody's worried."
50210,Lisa,you said it was boston.
46191,Lisa,"and you like the same one i like -- with the grad-student glamour pack... just like the one in my... ...locker. that's mine, isn't it?"
46033,Lisa,"thank you, dad."
43793,Lisa,waaa! uhh! there's gum in my hair!
43692,Lisa,"hi, apu. can i put this poster in your window?"
44482,Lisa,"well, i know you don't want to disappoint dad, but how do you feel about lying to him?"
45884,Lisa,thank you.
51331,Lisa,what are ya doing? s'imaginary.
42215,Lisa,how could you? i won't do it!
48201,Lisa,"this is no act, they're actually trying to kill us!"

51998,Lisa,i hope maggie and the boys are all right.
50998,Lisa,"portia, you're the woman i dream of becoming, but mom is my mom."
42252,Lisa,"dad, we did something very bad."
50303,Lisa,this calls for some springfield silvertongue!
47750,Lisa,i didn't cushion your...
48002,Lisa,"dad, you sabotaged cameron for me!"
42019,Lisa,"i, lisa simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten malibu stacey accessories!"
43646,Lisa,their tap water tasted better than ours!
46258,Lisa,are we insane yet? are we insane yet? are we insane yet?
41732,Lisa,"i think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and i hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
42039,Lisa,bart's making faces.
50304,Lisa,"dad, look! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!"
41887,Lisa,yaaayyy!!
46714,Lisa,um... i'm a teacher's aide in a very special class.
48408,Lisa,but they're incompatible!
42106,Lisa,can't you see i'm reading a third-rate biography of copernicus i found at the bus station?
47620,Lisa,"well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. check out all the left-wing celebrities."
51328,Lisa,what are you doing?!
44977,Lisa,unbelievable!
45061,Lisa,me too.
51680,Lisa,"you know, they look a little similar."
52266,Lisa,"hello, dr. hibbert."
46050,Lisa,"dad! but if you're here, who's that on the float?"
51501,Lisa,hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
48655,Lisa,"cletus, i had to stop you exploiting the children, so i sent her an e-mail."
44487,Lisa,can i ask you about your dot?
45810,Lisa,"okay, that's it... looks good... oh, bart, the bulldog didn't ante!"
46872,Lisa,i think we might have termites.
45347,Lisa,b-3.
50323,Lisa,the noisy minority... the upside-down bubblegum collective... the regional lampoon... the plymouth grok experiment... fro and flo... allan sherman's helter shmelter...
49284,Lisa,yeah.
41935,Lisa,"oh, nothing. i just scheduled a tetanus booster. maybe i'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
43150,Lisa,"yeah, dad was right."
46016,Lisa,"oh, no."
47261,Lisa,"boy, this key opens everything."
48788,Lisa,"one thing i've always wondered: how can fox news be so conservative, when the fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? they don't fit together."
42163,Lisa,"a+! oh, bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades?"
45582,Lisa,"this broom closet is not what it seems. it's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot."
49862,Lisa,an f. an f! i hope harvard never finds out about this.
44599,Lisa,the carnival!
49368,Lisa,juliet! what are you doing here?
44831,Lisa,"dad, what have you done to your stomach?"
49994,Lisa,quiet! it's time for the noblest nobel prize of all: the peace prize.
45564,Lisa,answer to what?
47247,Lisa,this grown-up makeover / has made me a super-tween / for they are my people / and i am their queen!
51747,Lisa,why are you sharing all of this with us?
47901,Lisa,"dad, snowball's not fat. she's just got winter fur."
47444,Lisa,"oh bart, that's really sweet."
41843,Lisa,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? ewww.
42287,Lisa,"hey, wait... that's not a dummy!"

48222,Lisa,i already made up a yard-sale sign!
48644,Lisa,and guess what -- ben and ken the street magic men are only the beginning! the city is a treasure trove of culture and multi-culture!
48301,Lisa,"i don't understand, dad. our family has so many flaws. why must we share them with the world?"
52064,Lisa,"i'm watching sideshow bob. you know, he's a lot less patronizing than krusty used to be."
46834,Lisa,"oh bart, i think we're lost."
43543,Lisa,i like school.
45566,Lisa,"dad, i'm tired of bathing in the yard. plus, i think rod and todd are watching."
50409,Lisa,you just ruined six months' work!
47048,Lisa,"okay, paperclip, do your stuff."
46509,Lisa,"look, we can't fall into old patterns. we've gotta think of a plan."
42282,Lisa,homer.
48931,Lisa,how is that fun? fun is only fun if everyone's having fun.
47399,Lisa,"dad's gonna catch flanders, just like the end of mom's book."
42731,Lisa,how about me?
49035,Lisa,"panic not, fellow springfielders!"
43668,Lisa,wow!
44515,Lisa,hey! / what are you...? / wait a minute. / wait! wait! wait! / settle down! / no! no! no! / excuse me! / no! no!
45754,Lisa,what about my pledge to build the world's largest bookmobile? isn't there any money left for that?
50012,Lisa,it can't be saturday already! monday was orientation. tuesday we did mime.
43032,Lisa,grades are all i have. what could i be failing? i'm smart and a teacher's pet.
47417,Lisa,we can't jump this ditch.
50429,Lisa,yes... no... i don't know! it means that... that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up. and you're cute in the moonlight.
50248,Lisa,"but until then this tree will stand for everything mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
47625,Lisa,swim toward san francisco!
49582,Lisa,could you?
46437,Lisa,and who sent it down that pipe?
49158,Lisa,"i need to get out while i still can. thank you, mel."
52311,Lisa,"so, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?"
45978,Lisa,"dad, change it back!"
48236,Lisa,"willie, in the next few weeks i'll be teaching you poise, pronunciation and posture. let's see you stand up as straight as you can."
44700,Lisa,"wow, dad was a good speller?"
43376,Lisa,"no, mom! bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville."
52253,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart. but if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention i'd receive, i'd miss you."
43797,Lisa,gaaah!
46158,Lisa,lieutenant smash...
44758,Lisa,can i?
44005,Lisa,"i like you, too, milhouse, but not in that way. you're more like a big sister."
50341,Lisa,where am i? this neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... sesame street.
44666,Lisa,ewww!
50541,Lisa,no fair!
41937,Lisa,that looks like an olympic torch to me. your husband could be an olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
49604,Lisa,looks like maggie wants a story too.
42886,Lisa,"i appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body."
46160,Lisa,how could you soil the good name of star blitzzz promotions?
52016,Lisa,"yeah, what'd you get?"
51220,Lisa,no one can use it but no one gets hurt!
44863,Lisa,i should've got off in crackton.
48961,Lisa,what?!
45834,Lisa,"wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
48549,Lisa,"oh dad, i'm tired. we'll read more tomorrow."
43856,Lisa,friends? hah! these are my only friends...
44624,Lisa,oh yeah! / absolutely! / at least twice as much!
43634,Lisa,you know how a horse goes like this? mom? like this? mom?
51530,Lisa,how'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
44566,Lisa,"sorry, daddy."
47607,Lisa,make mine calico!
45977,Lisa,"oh, you're so heroic."
52189,Lisa,embrace nothingness.
42833,Lisa,time's up?!
44920,Lisa,i'm just a little girl.
44972,Lisa,you're taking me! you got that?! and it's gonna be a magical evening!
43233,Lisa,just a couple more blocks to my house.
48018,Lisa,we've got school tomorrow.
43466,Lisa,no.
45788,Lisa,"bart, we're having a meeting."
45767,Lisa,"bart, get out of here!"
42613,Lisa,"dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
48972,Lisa,you calm down!
42229,Lisa,"my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place!"
51067,Lisa,my bully is my teacher.
50348,Lisa,how did you do all that?
47305,Lisa,put out the fire first.
48228,Lisa,you're a jerk! i'm telling mom!
44373,Lisa,"oh, it's too hard. my hand is slipping."
43434,Lisa,yeah. the sun is still out.
51902,Lisa,there go my young-girl dreams of vassar.
47559,Lisa,"quiet, grampa. hello... mom?!?!"
47130,Lisa,"look, cookie! there's a dance tonight!"
48020,Lisa,"dad, we've been so worried about you!"
49923,Lisa,"no, no, you'll like it. it's about the ocean."
48416,Lisa,there are so many worse crimes. why are you persecuting me?
49833,Lisa,huh?
44012,Lisa,"oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. be the baby, kitty. go on, be the baby."
49711,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna convince you to turn yourselves in."
52326,Lisa,eating is worse than opening eyes.
47891,Lisa,that's a bread compartment.
45014,Lisa,homer! / dad! / look out!
50169,Lisa,"what's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home, if i have to do my learning here?"
43248,Lisa,thanks.
50994,Lisa,things that you're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed.
45964,Lisa,but...
42286,Lisa,"good luck in your trumped-up law suit, dad."
45183,Lisa,wait! we don't need supernatural powers! we already know their secrets.
51467,Lisa,mom! dad! the retirement home lost its license and grampa has nowhere to live!
47621,Lisa,"i don't know whether it's the lack of sleep, the sodium pentathol, or that it's the only cartoon i've seen in two months. but this is what i believe in now."
43246,Lisa,hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
48165,Lisa,you really speak italian?!
46530,Lisa,"ooh, a salute to brunch! wave to brunch, maggie!"
48996,Lisa,oh.
47058,Lisa,and what's that?
46996,Lisa,s-c-a-b-i-e-s.
49843,Lisa,just close your eyes and think of milhouse.
47783,Lisa,"it shows the history of nuclear physics, from marie curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor."
47923,Lisa,"oh yeah? well, there's your girlfriend."
42500,Lisa,if the snakes were in here we could protect them.
49141,Lisa,"here you go, krusty."
47888,Lisa,"mom, why are you so worried about money?"
43501,Lisa,ewwww.
45459,Lisa,"but, dad, i thought you hated..."
43151,Lisa,when krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away.
42531,Lisa,you mean those diet milkshakes?
52501,Lisa,"mom, i've gotta know. once and for all, what is the secret? why did you stay with dad so long?"
52452,Lisa,can i have wine?
47475,Lisa,i'm a mess. i can't believe i'm jealous of a baby.
51592,Lisa,i would've found a friend eventually. you couldn't wait a damn decade until i got into college?
47604,Lisa,that's not what dogs do.
44341,Lisa,hi.
43845,Lisa,no.
48454,Lisa,it's jazz! jazz! you don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me!
48936,Lisa,dad?
42709,Lisa,"i can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this, this is their role model."
45560,Lisa,ew! these records used to be real accomplishments. now they're just gross.
48527,Lisa,"moe, you're a heartless jerk!"
49831,Lisa,no! you lie! eliza simpson can't be a coward! she's the only decent ancestor i have.
51595,Lisa,please stop!
41623,Lisa,"so how do you like being a walrus, dad?"
47431,Lisa,bart! i cracked the code of the pictograph. it says there's a curse on the mound. of course i don't believe in...
48503,Lisa,"mom, we've got to stop them from pacifying our town!"
44477,Lisa,"after all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig?!"
44163,Lisa,"bart, there must be millions of dollars there!"
47916,Lisa,"hey, that's the smell of her real family! the simpsons! and for your information, our walls have a bunch of dead raccoons in them. but we are saving up the money to find them!"
44346,Lisa,"it's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" i just don't feel challenged."
47741,Lisa,"oh, that moe. but good for you, mom! why didn't you follow chloe into journalism?"
51103,Lisa,--like someone faked being hit so they wouldn't be a suspect.
49532,Lisa,"hello, smiley face. hello, smiley face."
50048,Lisa,nelson?!
49494,Lisa,i was so bored!
48636,Lisa,you haven't heard the last of this!
46175,Lisa,bart's got a girlfriend!
43842,Lisa,that song is so lame.
43007,Lisa,are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today?
43131,Lisa,"you're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
50620,Lisa,"oh, dad! i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason."
43863,Lisa,bye-bye lisa simpson.
45562,Lisa,"""allen ginsburgers, un-american cheese sandwich, polio dogs..."""
46444,Lisa,i feel like i want to throw up.
43855,Lisa,"heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal..."
47339,Lisa,"dad, you have to say something. something meaningful!"
51642,Lisa,what's wrong?
49892,Lisa,that only angers me more.
51924,Lisa,"i'm not a little egg sucker, am i?"
51237,Lisa,you're rotating it in the wrong direction!
49809,Lisa,i never thought of that before.
51892,Lisa,amen. let's eat.
52425,Lisa,"when i fall asleep, mr. bergstrom is the last thing i think of, and he's my first thought when i wake up."
49338,Lisa,"well... if i pick plain she'll think i'm cheap, but if i pick peanut, she may have an allergy. you just killed her, bart!"
41767,Lisa,"happy birthday to me / happy birthday to me / happy birthday, overlooked middle child -- happy birthday to me."
50924,Lisa,not sure what your motivation for that is.
48896,Lisa,...so when bob collapsed in the courtroom...
45046,Lisa,i told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
49815,Lisa,run!
48811,Lisa,"no, no. it's a good thing."
45403,Lisa,wow. me... fit in.
44087,Lisa,what's going on outside?
51390,Lisa,fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury?
43106,Lisa,"danger, danger... my hooks are flailing wildly!"
47586,Lisa,"no, i think the expression is ""peg."""
46788,Lisa,"""dear dad, took money for the school book fair."""
48208,Lisa,"i don't know, dad. this time of year everybody does it, 'cause you don't have to pay for the music rights."
52188,Lisa,i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
42932,Lisa,oh no. please don't show me with ralph.
47627,Lisa,"i miss america, too. the united states has its grandeur and its follies, but mostly it's the place where all our stuff is."
42907,Lisa,"it's the beating of that hideous heart! i mean, i think i hear something."
44651,Lisa,i rest my case.
51876,Lisa,yeah!
42120,Lisa,ewww.
48157,Lisa,uh... check.
48903,Lisa,that means that springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! even earlier than new hampshire!
44181,Lisa,don't worry. a moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
42373,Lisa,glad you liked it.
43177,Lisa,"you're certainly in a good mood tonight, dad."
51479,Lisa,"this one's nibbling a sunflower seed! look at that hair -- oh, i just wanna comb it forever! have you seen a pinker nose? i have now!"
41701,Lisa,"so, i guess this is it? it you don't mind i'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
50882,Lisa,well... at least i have a college fund!
45121,Lisa,"uh, i am sick of everyone being so proud of me!"
48960,Lisa,nothing!
51477,Lisa,"oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin! but this fella is so fuzzy!"
51498,Lisa,she is?
45254,Lisa,"dad, don't do that!"
46514,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that you're breaking up our family?
42173,Lisa,"dear mom and dad, i no longer fear hell, because i've been to kamp krusty."
50267,Lisa,we've got to stop mom from going out with those women.
50942,Lisa,"dad, the baby giraffe is taking its first steps!"
43190,Lisa,"uh, i wasn't talking about you, dad."
47007,Lisa,"well, i haven't won yet--"
51353,Lisa,and i also wanna say that if--
44099,Lisa,no.
45048,Lisa,of course... the transplant! somehow snake's hair must be controlling--
46126,Lisa,i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
45201,Lisa,vincent price's egg magic!
47441,Lisa,but it's not my turn.
47275,Lisa,"mom, i was elected to make this a better school."
46431,Lisa,"you know, if dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
46121,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm impressed."
48784,Lisa,"no! i mean chris ""ludacris"" bridges, right here in the dental plaza!"
47319,Lisa,"you can strangle bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
44652,Lisa,object-objection! he's not asking any questions!
43341,Lisa,that's only the cat.
51653,Lisa,it's true! it would be a cold day in hell when i was popular.
52201,Lisa,eighth hole.
49345,Lisa,"hey mom, can juliet sleep over?"
44610,Lisa,"bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig."
41782,Lisa,yes!
48291,Lisa,maybe there's another way to solve this. bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot.
44887,Lisa,i guess...
42667,Lisa,what? who? huh? what?
51894,Lisa,the dad has a shirt on.
48880,Lisa,that voice!
43871,Lisa,"hey, a library! no, i can't. that's the old nerdy lisa."
52489,Lisa,but surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback. love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.
49853,Lisa,you wanted to get caught.
44693,Lisa,it's a pig!
46579,Lisa,why are you driving a car?
45706,Lisa,dear mr. president
44897,Lisa,"archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means."
49233,Lisa,"okay, back to the real world."
49799,Lisa,the diary of eliza simpson?
49180,Lisa,mom and dad are spying on you. there's a tracking chip in your cell phone!
42822,Lisa,me too.
51497,Lisa,"here he is! ""johan oldenveldt, painter, lived in amsterdam, paris... prolific early 20th century naturalist... i think this was painted by someone famous. maybe it's valuable."
43063,Lisa,how did you get tickets?
48536,Lisa,mom! mom!
46736,Lisa,can i come with you?
41918,Lisa,"i just called to say i love you, dad."
46842,Lisa,i'm sorry i got us lost out here.
43843,Lisa,no.
44792,Lisa,it's lisa.
42809,Lisa,hot dogs / armour hot dogs...
42349,Lisa,"bart, quit it, bart. quit it, quit it, quit it!"
44138,Lisa,adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
49404,Lisa,so dad's life would have been the same! he would have married mom and worked for mr. burns. it would have been a push!
45774,Lisa,"not now, bart. i'm about to speak to a hundred million people. this speech could make or break my presidency."
42793,Lisa,"they're not ""imprisoning us,"" bart. they're..."
50153,Lisa,"mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the a-train... then suddenly, when she was a high school senior blam!"
42534,Lisa,oh my.
46133,Lisa,are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
50214,Lisa,"or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner."
44623,Lisa,yaaay! here comes the leader!
45163,Lisa,"i've never heard of these bands, mom. what kind of music do they play?"
51634,Lisa,"bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. no one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
45448,Lisa,but you promised me we'd do something japanese.
42887,Lisa,i don't need a card. you live in the room next to me.
42284,Lisa,"this wouldn't have anything to do with laura coming over, would it?"
42767,Lisa,"it's perfect, dad."
47994,Lisa,"hi! this lighting's a little bright. and um, could i get a red wash in the background?"
43684,Lisa,we could?
52317,Lisa,"sorry, i'd rather go to heaven."
46049,Lisa,"oh, dad. you sold your soul."
51350,Lisa,"so, do you know how i can win?"
48490,Lisa,"bart, did your mystical jewish monster beat up those bullies?"
47512,Lisa,bones!
51216,Lisa,is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
49891,Lisa,"well, i will never forgive you, bart."
46470,Lisa,i'm a buddhist!
52407,Lisa,lincoln lincoln i been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / is it water is it wine? / oh my god it's turpentine! / faster! faster!
43444,Lisa,nooooo! it's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
42971,Lisa,"sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick. but in 1990, he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail."
51129,Lisa,i don't know... it's four days old... i just ate...
51904,Lisa,ogre is such a strong word.
43189,Lisa,"i like him. he's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
48220,Lisa,they had to feed you through a tube.
51473,Lisa,"""i, lisa simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other."
51921,Lisa,"you'll never get one now, mr. name-caller."
50934,Lisa,he's there too?!
45110,Lisa,"i need a miracle. come on, you owe me."
47343,Lisa,this is offensive to christians and prunes.
48708,Lisa,so from now on i'll play soccer for the same reason i study chemistry -- for fun!
47937,Lisa,right after pat sajak.
45493,Lisa,"dad, that's so mean."
44726,Lisa,you have to listen to the notes she's not playing!
52491,Lisa,what are you doing here?
41892,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
47358,Lisa,ap-cray.
50522,Lisa,"exotic... vegetarian... i can mention it in a college essay... mom, this is amazing!"
49326,Lisa,they sound awfully mad. are they dangerous?
43145,Lisa,we have a bomb shelter?
47697,Lisa,"i don't want mickey mantle, i want my mom."
50960,Lisa,what just happened? who's bongo?
42296,Lisa,promise you'll never do that again.
48956,Lisa,"bart, keep it together. people are looking!"
44918,Lisa,"wow! an alternate ending to ""casablanca!"" bart, this could be priceless!"
51633,Lisa,"these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. one of them, however, has the broccoli blended in."
48789,Lisa,not true. you've got the guts -- and i've got a web cam! this time you can tell the truth...
43257,Lisa,are you saying we won't see my family again?
43012,Lisa,chorus line of people / dancin' till they make us stop /
47063,Lisa,i gotta pick a career! gotta pick a career!
46793,Lisa,another proud moment for the simpsons.
43133,Lisa,i'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
49635,Lisa,"well, i didn't kill mrs. krabappel!"
52328,Lisa,is too.
52013,Lisa,happy birthday!
45574,Lisa,"principal skinner, i thought public schools were required to have access ramps for the disabled."
46906,Lisa,could it be some kind of book?
42532,Lisa,we're getting 50% of the t-shirt sales.
43132,Lisa,"well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
45421,Lisa,what are you doing here?
50387,Lisa,"raymondo, i knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep. raymondo?"
51274,Lisa,"wow! that was great! can i have my regular clothes back, please?"
48681,Lisa,okay.
51715,Lisa,"yeah, you really get that it's all about the music."
50758,Lisa,"well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
51261,Lisa,is bart cheating?
44567,Lisa,"bart, this is patches, and what was your name?"
51257,Lisa,i guess i'll be getting some extra credit for this.
43042,Lisa,"please, dad, i'll be fine."
43114,Lisa,"dad, i know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
43718,Lisa,"you know, dad, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
45720,Lisa,why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?
42104,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
49342,Lisa,i don't know -- it's been so long since i've had a playdate. not that i couldn't get one if i wanted...
48668,Lisa,"nelson, you came to our side in our hour of need."
52355,Lisa,"oh, no. i don't want to fall behind my class."

41614,Lisa,why it's my best friend...
42889,Lisa,why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
46868,Lisa,it's a hockey game!
51147,Lisa,no! that's impossible! he's dead! i lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.
51438,Lisa,our school cafeteria is serving g.m.o.s -- genetically-modified organisms.
50584,Lisa,does anybody want my opinion?
44824,Lisa,"wow, dad, you're really working hard."
48665,Lisa,what if we're not here?
43599,Lisa,"do i understand you correctly, bartron? do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?"
44640,Lisa,"we may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more till tomorrow."
52106,Lisa,"well, okay. i got an a on my vocabulary test."
43664,Lisa,yay!
43770,Lisa,okay. time for truth or dare. you go first.
41688,Lisa,that life is worth living.
50111,Lisa,"c'mon, guys. i had to get rid of bart."
45616,Lisa,/ push! /
43242,Lisa,"oh, you are so good to put up with all of this."

42285,Lisa,i don't care. ask hef over there.
52058,Lisa,we'd kill ourselves!
50557,Lisa,"there, finished. now if i win just two more games of online boggle, i'll be ready to start writing."
46982,Lisa,"i guess i won't be popular this year, either."
50374,Lisa,"the can is in two halves, and they slide apart."
45301,Lisa,not you.
42847,Lisa,"oh, well, y'know, it ain't so great. bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! well, anyway, i brought you a present."
47033,Lisa,eww! i got bart's veal!
46332,Lisa,i've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
52133,Lisa,heh... heh... heh.
52024,Lisa,"are you going bowling again tonight, mom?"
44047,Lisa,"no. you don't understand, nelson. a kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
47703,Lisa,what?
41586,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, you want to buy some band candy?"
50213,Lisa,the poor guy hurt his wing.
42934,Lisa,"now you listen to me -- i don't like you. i never liked you, and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
41680,Lisa,"i'll tell you what's wrong: you getting a c on this project and winding up at a third-rate college. lisa, the world needs you to go to wellesley!"
45796,Lisa,"legalize what? oh, oh. consider it done."
50842,Lisa,"anyone who wants to be in this, grab a doublet and meet me backstage!"
48890,Lisa,now!
43169,Lisa,it says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.
42890,Lisa,"give it to me! hey wait, there's nothing bad here."
43889,Lisa,"aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
43711,Lisa,you did. until i realized that jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to.
45191,Lisa,"i did, until we came here last year."
46024,Lisa,nooo!
47599,Lisa,granted.
45711,Lisa,"ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
46433,Lisa,"hey, there's mesmerino."
45791,Lisa,"you're too much, bart. that's why i'm appointing you ""secretary of keeping it real."""
46719,Lisa,mm. mom's not gonna like that.
48223,Lisa,my malibu stacy heads!
45773,Lisa,fiscal solvency.
46781,Lisa,william bonney?!
44968,Lisa,eww!
46361,Lisa,"dad, that's the water softener!"
48706,Lisa,"dad, i can't forgive you because there's nothing to forgive."
47533,Lisa,better technology doesn't mean better storytelling.
44247,Lisa,"eh, well, that's okay. i can always sell seeds. do you want some seeds?"
52242,Lisa,aren't you forgetting something?
48064,Lisa,"well, i heard they finished the stamp museum. that could be fun."
46450,Lisa,like the whore of babylon?
45949,Lisa,"no, dad! we don't want to kill him! let's call animal control."
45622,Lisa,but they were trying to eat me!
48762,Lisa,"sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
49717,Lisa,i wish i weren't.
48388,Lisa,i always thought that boys had it easier. but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined.
44325,Lisa,i found a malibu stacy with no head!
44150,Lisa,i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
48521,Lisa,it's tom wolfe! he uses more exclamation points than any other major american writer.
45714,Lisa,you read my letter?
44833,Lisa,uh... mom?
46317,Lisa,"are you blushing, mr. flanders?"
45687,Lisa,"wow, he's got every nancy drew! even the controversial ""clue in the clock."" so many swears."
50644,Lisa,hit refresh.
45239,Lisa,"okay, dad, we're ready."
47320,Lisa,"dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. that's the whole point of moby dick."
51847,Lisa,what's his name?
46096,Lisa,"dad, did you read all these books today?"
43099,Lisa,"uh, neat... anyway, mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
44645,Lisa,"your honor, the defense calls its first and only witness: milhouse van houten."
45316,Lisa,"excuse me, uh, pharaoh? i think moses here has something to ask you. go."
46120,Lisa,"ooh, it says here that special effects whiz tom savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!"
46790,Lisa,there's no light rail in springfield.
42486,Lisa,"january 8, 1815. two weeks after the war ended."
45016,Lisa,"me, too!"
47618,Lisa,that's from the first amendment to the constitution. thank you.
45294,Lisa,how can you embarrass me like this? you won't sit through anything that doesn't have car crashes!
49811,Lisa,but-but-but-but-but...
42107,Lisa,"close the gate, maggie."
47582,Lisa,did i do anything right?
46156,Lisa,"l.t., thank god you're here! the government's putting subliminal messages in your videos!"
48872,Lisa,"the tivo is installed! now we can watch shows, and skip the commercials!"
42539,Lisa,dean martin still packs 'em in.
45358,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
49024,Lisa,i want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of americans. for years we've known how dangerous it is. it stunts your growth. and it's marketed to children. i'm talking about ballet.
43538,Lisa,have you told mom about this?
46880,Lisa,i guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
46734,Lisa,well...
43463,Lisa,i can't eat this. i can't eat a poor little lamb!
50579,Lisa,"and the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
43254,Lisa,what about my family's tradition?
41628,Lisa,"oh, can that tuna! we can get your brain to work the same way you always get the tv to work -- by hitting it!"
49662,Lisa,why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts? why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts?
44678,Lisa,"you look a little nervous, dad."
42635,Lisa,huh?
47160,Lisa,well i'm afraid the law is clear and dad did renounce all claim to ownership.
46611,Lisa,"that's just you, bart."
46200,Lisa,i just don't understand francine's motivation.
48393,Lisa,this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living. who cares what she thinks?
48351,Lisa,a mental challenge.
50167,Lisa,oh yeah?
46068,Lisa,that's a party magic college.
48604,Lisa,"but it didn't bring your parents back. tell me, big boy, was it really worth it?"
50219,Lisa,"oh... okay, maybe he's not so bad."
45601,Lisa,"dad, dad, you're driving on the sidewalk."
46193,Lisa,"milhouse? she got you, too?"
48462,Lisa,"well, i kind of like this guy..."
44685,Lisa,maybe i can't concentrate because of all your cooties.
46732,Lisa,doogie howser went to college when he was my age.
51063,Lisa,"""ann, mark, bill and sally are on the ferris wheel. ann is behind sally. mark is in front of bill."
52270,Lisa,"well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the..."
48131,Lisa,"what do you think? huh? huh? pretty heartfelt, huh? huh?"
44463,Lisa,"can you help me get my ball down from the roof, dad?"
43819,Lisa,"but immigration is what america's all about. even the simpson family immigrated to america. right, grampa?"
44771,Lisa,"well, we used to date. plus, he threatened me."
45839,Lisa,"north dakota, here we come!"
42070,Lisa,all right! a test!
44431,Lisa,"""dear lisa, may your new saxophone bring you years of d'oh!"""
46943,Lisa,"uh, guys? mom just left the basement!"
45043,Lisa,"uh, bart?"
47216,Lisa,what happens if i press this button?
51771,Lisa,"i've been emotionally dealing with that all week. so, yes."
45263,Lisa,dad!
49681,Lisa,"i'm gonna put a spell on you! yes i am, my tuna-breath familiar."
47349,Lisa,"it's saturday, december sixth."
46548,Lisa,"hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn!"
49818,Lisa,that's eliza's mother!
42523,Lisa,no they don't.
50288,Lisa,"'angry dad: the movie.' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."""
42706,Lisa,don't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says?
44355,Lisa,is there any answer i can give that won't result in more push-ups?
52307,Lisa,"but everybody does it! i mean, we're stealing cable as we speak."
52251,Lisa,"mr. murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping springfield gorge on a skateboard."
50826,Lisa,lisa simpson superstar!
44480,Lisa,i don't want to make the team.
48497,Lisa,martians? you do know that radio broadcast was a hoax?
45832,Lisa,"not really, no."
44224,Lisa,stop it! stand still! maybe i can pop it back in.
51034,Lisa,i've got perfume spritzers.
50656,Lisa,fine. i'll shut down the site.
42968,Lisa,"dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning. can we listen to something else?"
51028,Lisa,"guys, look!"
52514,Lisa,"oh, isn't that a little dangerous?"
47689,Lisa,i can't believe my mom would cheat.
49919,Lisa,a little.
44152,Lisa,no. they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it.
48718,Lisa,"mom, put your glasses on."
43569,Lisa,how did you survive?
50668,Lisa,lisa. now this is the most important place in the world.
42800,Lisa,why?
48300,Lisa,this is an abc sweatshirt.
47419,Lisa,but i know so much about it.
51075,Lisa,i've got to know before you leave! why don't you like me?
47330,Lisa,"wait, santa's little helper had puppies before."
45364,Lisa,how could you miss that huge boat coming right at us?
47821,Lisa,a shirt from that rap concert... bart must've gone to the show. but that means...
42011,Lisa,"you know, dad, we've been watching a lot of tv lately. maybe, the sunday after the super bowl, we could hike up to the top of mount springfield. the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
48302,Lisa,but dad...
52451,Lisa,can we have wine?
50946,Lisa,"look at these obscure card games! hey, do you have ""uno?"""
48370,Lisa,"nelson, you're not really angry at me. you're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
52389,Lisa,"grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table."
49866,Lisa,somebody posted a comment?
50254,Lisa,i'll go outside and make snow angels.
48455,Lisa,i always wanted a jazz nickname!
43262,Lisa,i thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
45842,Lisa,"oh, he'll never dance with her. she'll have to settle for some mexican milhouse."
51855,Lisa,nurturing.
51701,Lisa,parking lot.
45209,Lisa,isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
46696,Lisa,bravo!
51843,Lisa,"what, aunt patty?"
46937,Lisa,"oh dad, you do remember something about me. perhaps you also remember this laser bart gave me earlier!"
45469,Lisa,"all right, i'll go! you don't have to be a jerk about it."
50598,Lisa,i liked the knowledgeable docents.
44052,Lisa,don't worry. nelson and i don't like each other anymore.
46950,Lisa,"dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a wnba game."
49285,Lisa,it was my brother bart!
44580,Lisa,but we would have had each other anyway.
45149,Lisa,can i fluff your pillow?
41795,Lisa,mommm!
48738,Lisa,"corn... more corn... another kid getting' thrown in the air... witch's coven... seattle space needle... amateur production of ""you can't take it with you""... i'm getting dizzy... and corn again."
43473,Lisa,"ah, excuse me? isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
43001,Lisa,"hello. ""we're here."" ""hi."" etc."
46518,Lisa,but i have to save them! the books no one buys get chopped up and fed to pigs.
52518,Lisa,"oh, poor bart. my daughter thinks i'm a lousy mother."
42671,Lisa,"you're right, bart. school is for losers."
45139,Lisa,"... and the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and i don't deserve your applause. i cheated on that test."
45335,Lisa,who?
50815,Lisa,i'll do anything but sing!
52171,Lisa,the pennyloafer!
46693,Lisa,"bart, stick to the script. don't be a jerk."
41880,Lisa,"dad, that's monaco."
50400,Lisa,"bart, i am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest."
48554,Lisa,it would be the day my childhood ended.
50792,Lisa,it's not a frown. it is a straight line of resignation. looks just the same upside down.
43994,Lisa,why do you have to be such a pain all the time? don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
48859,Lisa,"aw, it's okay."
45669,Lisa,"mom, i lost dad and bart."
49030,Lisa,"the money helps us serve the community! we plant trees, pick up litter, cut up milk bones for old dogs..."
41946,Lisa,i made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
48194,Lisa,more like jailed at sing sing!
50442,Lisa,"i've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
46801,Lisa,"look, there's dad!"
43196,Lisa,"goodbye, mr. sherman. if i ever play carnegie hall, i'll give you a call."
47795,Lisa,"this must be the ""nasty surprise"" he mentioned in the invitation."
47215,Lisa,why can't i tinker with the fabric of existence?
49698,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
52426,Lisa,"no, no. you don't understand. when mr. bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --"
42684,Lisa,"dad, are you listening to me?"
48239,Lisa,"no! c'mon, willie. i believe in you!"
51048,Lisa,please-be-her! please-be-her!
41645,Lisa,"this is kind of relaxing. but it's so hard to turn off my brain. i have to stop thinking... starting now. hey, it worked. oh no, that's thinking!"
51296,Lisa,"well, you're never alone surrounded by ""the autobiography of charles manson."""
46617,Lisa,"you are the true dauphin. you had this impostor try to fool me, to see if i was truly sent by god."
43607,Lisa,hmm. that looks entertaining.
48212,Lisa,"well, what choice do you have?"
49858,Lisa,"an f?! okay, this is the time when i always wake up."
44668,Lisa,"no, dad, it's to fight soil erosion."
48288,Lisa,she looks like she's crying.
43551,Lisa,"hey, leave my dad alone. just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. he's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
51629,Lisa,i guess you're right.
50084,Lisa,"c'mon, maggie. i need to get good at fencing so i can put it on my resume and get into yale. don't be scared. i won't hurt my widdle sister."
49005,Lisa,wowww... no! all i need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
43101,Lisa,"dad, i like picking beans with grandma."
52194,Lisa,"no, bart. it's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. it's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."
44095,Lisa,what about our dad?!
52379,Lisa,to the pony rides.
44911,Lisa,someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. we can get a new one.
44486,Lisa,ohhhh. / hiiiii.
50640,Lisa,"so, since i had no friends, i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. did we become friends? no."
45232,Lisa,"but dad, lemurs are nocturnal."
44127,Lisa,nope.
50056,Lisa,"well, i didn't do this for thanks, but if you want to thank me, i can stand here and listen for as long as it takes."
43200,Lisa,"wow, you can see into the... present."
51355,Lisa,"congratulations, isabel. i truly hope you enjoy the friday morning council meetings and the, the free snickerdoodle cookies."
44524,Lisa,excuse me. i took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. soon we will have all the facts.
51979,Lisa,okay.
49877,Lisa,"ah yes, ""jerusalem syndrome."" the name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit jerusalem."
45523,Lisa,they're evacuating the earth! we're saved!
44338,Lisa,"look, it's reverend lovejoy!"
50593,Lisa,"um, i think we're supposed to get off here."
51583,Lisa,want some more smoothie?
49371,Lisa,how did you find this place?
49949,Lisa,i didn't know we had a debate team.
41703,Lisa,mr. bergstrom left today.
50349,Lisa,"i do, i do!"
51671,Lisa,a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need... my hero...
46805,Lisa,"bart, i have to study for the elementary school achievement test. and so do you."
46346,Lisa,i'm just sayin'...
49275,Lisa,and they've already started exploiting the next holiday.
46314,Lisa,it's lucky for me that legs was an experienced mob doctor.
44284,Lisa,hmm. you've never heard of recycling? it means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
44425,Lisa,and my gifts are still going to waste.
42196,Lisa,everybody was cheering for you.
46061,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
49183,Lisa,"i think we're following you. what's your species, little guy?"
43627,Lisa,do i have to go? that country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
51913,Lisa,no there aren't.
48602,Lisa,i feel it would be best if we just stayed friends.
43873,Lisa,only kids are that incoherent!
50631,Lisa,they-they don't?
44049,Lisa,then why did you want to be with me?
44562,Lisa,dad...
50733,Lisa,"hello, lovebirds."
44964,Lisa,date?
48138,Lisa,just take my whole backpack!
44113,Lisa,"hurry nanny, things are"
47184,Lisa,does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?
52435,Lisa,not mine.
51518,Lisa,...isn't rich...
45500,Lisa,it's gonna kill you!
49446,Lisa,can't get enough.
42572,Lisa,i think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
45027,Lisa,what the heck's going on?
49262,Lisa,well what did you think her name was before it was kennedy?
48639,Lisa,me... a tutor?
45480,Lisa,"wow, a bustling metropolitan newsroom, funnelling scoops from all over the globe."
44837,Lisa,"oh, i can't wait! in just twenty minutes, we'll be in a three hour line to see the orb of isis."
43931,Lisa,that waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
49369,Lisa,"i'd love to! oh, but i'm supposed to attend the model u.n. this weekend. i'm the delegate from azerbaijan, and i'm threatening a rice tariff!"
50905,Lisa,this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me! i was ivy! strong ivy!
46267,Lisa,the chimps are running a diamond mine?!
45897,Lisa,sheriff lowbrow...
48923,Lisa,what did i miss? how did it end?
50161,Lisa,"mom, could you keep it down a little? i'm trying to study."
51458,Lisa,so... how strong are you?
51293,Lisa,a spitwad?
48248,Lisa,i give you... groundskeeper willie!
47313,Lisa,grampa! you have a job?
52140,Lisa,"if you don't believe me, look at this book i found."
41917,Lisa,"this next song is also about a girl and her pony. it's called ""wildfire."""
44917,Lisa,do you know you have your hands in each other's pockets?
45186,Lisa,"our top secret tonight: gay divorcée luann van houten has been cheating on her boyfriend pyro -- with his best friend, gyro."
45999,Lisa,it's lisa!
50088,Lisa,"hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball! connie mack, sandy alomar, terry francona, pinky higgins--"
41670,Lisa,maybe i should just move on to question two.
46904,Lisa,"a laser pointer! thanks, bart."
47719,Lisa,that was too easy.
52137,Lisa,"hey, how come we never see you guys eat?"
45435,Lisa,this also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
42331,Lisa,really?
42235,Lisa,i'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. unless it's made out of plastic.
43930,Lisa,"hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
52419,Lisa,"no! no! it wasn't me! i would never do anything like that. it was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
50577,Lisa,i secretly switched the flash drives.
47430,Lisa,who?
46697,Lisa,i liked all the roles filled by minority actors.
43136,Lisa,"so, you loved her right from the start."
42009,Lisa,"the happiest day of my life was three sundays ago. i was sitting on my daddy's knee when the saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
46304,Lisa,"chief wiggum, can you drive me to school? it's an emergency."
42333,Lisa,but the ride only takes a minute.
49935,Lisa,"they must be bluella's children! hello, whale calves! your mother lives on through you!"
51044,Lisa,"please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons."
51705,Lisa,gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
46152,Lisa,uncle sam? let me play this backwards.
42915,Lisa,ren and stimpy do it all the time.
49436,Lisa,"there's a lesson here: life is fickle. you should appreciate every... stop kicking, bart!"
47957,Lisa,"hush, little baby, don't say a word / mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird / and if that mockingbird don't sing..."
42951,Lisa,haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
51040,Lisa,why do you think bad guys are so cool?
47926,Lisa,how did you know we were coming?
43666,Lisa,"hi, i'm lisa simpson. i'm here to research a report on jebediah."
51651,Lisa,docetism?
51935,Lisa,"bart, you can't go on like this."
52254,Lisa,"hey, mom. what're doing?/we were watching that!"
43801,Lisa,ah! ah! ah! stop! stop!
45283,Lisa,"you know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. and just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!"
45599,Lisa,"well, i guess that's it. come christmas eve, there'll be a funzo under every tree."
47730,Lisa,a media circus.
49915,Lisa,i'm gonna get real help. just try to keep her wet.
45040,Lisa,"i don't get it, bart. you got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all."
43593,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
50404,Lisa,we haven't even gotten our salads yet.
49398,Lisa,both. homer simpson... vance connor... fonzie... homer simpson... and the winner is homer simpson!
49383,Lisa,"it's a special place, but i need to live in the real world."
47253,Lisa,"or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- ­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."

42630,Lisa,"dad, look, i made fish sticks. they're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out."

52029,Lisa,i stand corrected.
48316,Lisa,"i was always cheering for you, grampa. till now."
42406,Lisa,"oh, george..."
50712,Lisa,"yo, mysterious pranksters, it's time for dinner."
49829,Lisa,"...and though hiram, mabel, and eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on. thank you."
47954,Lisa,i brought you some weak tea and dry toast.
45047,Lisa,whoaaa!
42989,Lisa,"oh, my poor dead kitty! please, not you too!"
49409,Lisa,"yep. in the future, people will look at this and they'll say ""whoever he was, he must've mattered."""
42096,Lisa,that's right. it was i.
46337,Lisa,it's my room!
46569,Lisa,see?
47477,Lisa,people who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality.
50741,Lisa,"well, well, mr. never-wrong was right again -- family vacations always suck. i called it. called. it."
43836,Lisa,"generation x may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
50900,Lisa,"okay, education paid for. with a gap year, to find myself. every nerve in my body is screaming ""cash out now,"" and yet... i've got a pair of aces!"
43201,Lisa,the death card.
51512,Lisa,martin took my topic. what do i do?
49551,Lisa,one of you said something bad about the other.
43433,Lisa,and they read newsweek instead of nothing.
45220,Lisa,"oh, how romantic!"
48828,Lisa,you sound weird.
49844,Lisa,how did you--
48111,Lisa,"goodbye, implications..."
42036,Lisa,no way.
44475,Lisa,you do?
45166,Lisa,even you?
41606,Lisa,lisa... lisa simpson...
46531,Lisa,why is this movie pg-13?
50081,Lisa,"uh, that's it."
46645,Lisa,"no dad, it's just the weather."
45836,Lisa,got that right. / durn tootin'. / boy howdy.

41658,Lisa,"wow, i'm actually passing as a college student! and they don't have a blue's clue. whoops, gotta age it up."
52272,Lisa,"anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken."
47015,Lisa,but you don't play the piano.
51554,Lisa,"no, i'm just, i... maybe you just haven't found the right food. huh? how 'bout ice cream?"
43291,Lisa,i've got an idea!
51532,Lisa,i'm sorry you weren't my first choice. in fact... i had my doubts about using you at all.
51764,Lisa,"you know, dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient."
45492,Lisa,the food is exquisite...
48801,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, dad!"
43147,Lisa,it's breaking up!
51135,Lisa,those are bedbugs!

42067,Lisa,"dar-ryl, dar-ryl."
45704,Lisa,i can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
50434,Lisa,i'll return this to the school.
48129,Lisa,"hello. i'm looking for something in a pipe cleaner. extra bendy, with medium fuzz."
42317,Lisa,daaad!
51846,Lisa,so love at first sight is possible.
42878,Lisa,i won first chair?
44577,Lisa,"run, mom!"
46009,Lisa,"oh, i can't take it! would it be so bad if i just went home for an hour?"
50397,Lisa,interested in these?
45829,Lisa,"you can't drive, dad. he's got your license."
43218,Lisa,that is good because eating animals is wrong.
42012,Lisa,what about daddy-daughter day?
48999,Lisa,this is how i always stand when i tell adults what they should be doing.
47454,Lisa,"okay, what's a good side dish?"
46843,Lisa,i don't think i've done anything else.
42361,Lisa,uh - huh.
47414,Lisa,fine. you can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
48173,Lisa,i had a wonderful time today. grázie. grázie míll-eh.
44805,Lisa,"it is, isn't it?"
48614,Lisa,the hitachees invented women's lacrosse... soft luggage...
49435,Lisa,"right, 'cause i wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king, susan sontag, sappho of lesbos, and, i suspect, peppermint patty..."
48578,Lisa,yum-yum fish?
48244,Lisa,"dad, get your own song."
47725,Lisa,"nothing. like many women, i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
46838,Lisa,thanks. where'd you get?...
43021,Lisa,so here's where you're hiding.
50732,Lisa,"""stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. it was huge! well, the first season and the last season."
42494,Lisa,"dad, everyone likes whacking day, but i hate it. is there something wrong with me?"
48082,Lisa,"if i can just spend the night here, i'll never be scared again. and boy, you're free to go home whenever you want."
48500,Lisa,"standardized tests, standardized tests, standardized tests..."
50556,Lisa,why is bach next to muddy waters? that's my problem -- i gotta get these cds organized!
43527,Lisa,"good-bye, bart!"
48166,Lisa,"okay, if that means teacher."
51161,Lisa,mom said we could watch it!
48274,Lisa,treasure?!
44561,Lisa,"you didn't invent that, bart. the indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks."
44003,Lisa,...on nelson muntz.
49783,Lisa,there is no dress. it's just pins! help me!
49136,Lisa,"in fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you! did you know the discovery channel doesn't have a single paid employee?"
49207,Lisa,"oh, bart. don't say things you can't take back."
47552,Lisa,baaaaaart!
48309,Lisa,we're not dead... and neither are you.
44038,Lisa,you'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man!
50976,Lisa,proctor clarkeson -- one student still hasn't taken the test!
51641,Lisa,"wow, mom! you're gonna open a sandwich store?!"
50425,Lisa,i am never gonna get my homework done tonight.
42663,Lisa,and i still don't have my saxophone.
50290,Lisa,"no dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises."
50300,Lisa,"now they're aggressive again! i'm sure there's a correlation, but could there be a... causation?"
41743,Lisa,"maggie, look. what's that?"
48083,Lisa,"hi, dr. nick."
42980,Lisa,i thought this was a secret ballot.
50997,Lisa,i'm exactly the kind of kid he's pretending to be.
46359,Lisa,ew!
44568,Lisa,here comes santa claus / here comes santa claus / right down santa claus lane... vixen and blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...
50844,Lisa,"fine, you're in."
43426,Lisa,"printhipal thkinner, i need thum shoes."
42648,Lisa,"well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding..."
50869,Lisa,not the favorite! not the favorite!
48930,Lisa,sounds like fun. can i play?
46932,Lisa,let's just get some sleep.
43540,Lisa,obesity is really unhealthy. any doctor will tell you that.
46860,Lisa,stop objectifying my mom!
41965,Lisa,how does that make him a hero?
45787,Lisa,no!
52261,Lisa,itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
44848,Lisa,yes!
47516,Lisa,yay!
47309,Lisa,elatiors.
44427,Lisa,you have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! and one cockroach!
45750,Lisa,"excellent question. yes, i am proud to be america's first straight female president. helen?"
48284,Lisa,i wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home.
50209,Lisa,thank god your son can't see the way you're behaving.
49293,Lisa,would i ever!
49562,Lisa,field trips to europe!
50866,Lisa,"mom, what's going on?"
46423,Lisa,now you've done it. you really humiliated mom.
50698,Lisa,why would you want to banish us from springfield?
52454,Lisa,can we do it this week?
49460,Lisa,a cryptic message! maybe this will lead me to the gem!
52025,Lisa,"oh, bart, don't you see? this is what psychologists call over-compensation. mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing."
49492,Lisa,you told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
46855,Lisa,this is a band-aid wrapped in tin foil.
50433,Lisa,so how come we have all these other keys?
48613,Lisa,oh... great! i'd... love to.
46220,Lisa,"i know, and the crowd is so distinguished. the inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
50257,Lisa,it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast...
49206,Lisa,"excuse me, boys! my brother is lost, and kind of a jerk. if he'd brought a map of the grounds as i suggested, then we would--"
43399,Lisa,"hey! i said that. my name is lisa simpson, and i made a chart of all the suspects in the burns case. look."
46865,Lisa,that's how i felt all along.
49119,Lisa,chef!
51384,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
44563,Lisa,"bart, what were you doing outside?"
48659,Lisa,pong!
48272,Lisa,"yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""hamlet."""
50185,Lisa,self-published?
44429,Lisa,"well, i really liked that story. but it still doesn't fix this."
47089,Lisa,"you can't have lights without power, and all the power comes from here."
46217,Lisa,please? it's for science.
44766,Lisa,"who needs college, mom. we're trillionaires! let's buy dune buggies."
43868,Lisa,"mom, come here. bring money."
42683,Lisa,"dad, you should blow the whistle on the kwik-e-mart."
47392,Lisa,hm...
47611,Lisa,can i have a lollipop?
48107,Lisa,stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. mom and dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.
46725,Lisa,in heaven!
41899,Lisa,"don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner."
43772,Lisa,okay... why don't you...
50432,Lisa,what's this key with the plastic skull for?
48022,Lisa,her films are so lyrical! the phone lines are gonna be jammed.
44064,Lisa,you've got to start backwards! / orange to orange! ignore the reds! / alternate corners! /
50140,Lisa,i know just how you feel!
44684,Lisa,"hey, some of us are still trying to solve it!"
50788,Lisa,that's mine!
48523,Lisa,"mr. szyslak -- there must be some person, possibly in this very room, who believed in you when no one else did."
42256,Lisa,"hurry, bart!"
41897,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
43962,Lisa,"mom's right, dad. the odds against you winning are a thousand to one."
42529,Lisa,we were asking you to appear on krusty's come back special.
50422,Lisa,taffy's up to something. and i won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. it's time to get boots on the ground.
44013,Lisa,c'mon!
47563,Lisa,"hey, do i hear a back rub?"
50691,Lisa,"thanks. but i couldn't have done it, mom. i mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life."
49670,Lisa,i have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. the pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands!
46100,Lisa,i make a lot of graphs.
47106,Lisa,"""nancy drew let out a low whistle. 'this isn't an old windmill at all. it's a new windmill!'"" no dad, i'm sure she won't be killed."
51603,Lisa,and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.
46419,Lisa,i think it can.
41655,Lisa,"i'm sorry, honey."
51255,Lisa,"now, the smartest kid. milhouse?"
48040,Lisa,everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like i chose buddhism.
47659,Lisa,dad! mr. burns cut our power -- now i can't print my paper!
44189,Lisa,"there's a lot more to it than that, bart. i don't just babysit; i sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour -- two dollars after nine o'clock."
48327,Lisa,"i know one, about the most important sea voyage in american history. the journey of the mayflower."
43024,Lisa,"i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. but doesn't the bible teach us ""judge not lest ye be judged,"" reverend?"
47087,Lisa,"forget it bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the fox satellite."
49211,Lisa,"if it's your shortcut, i'll be high and dry."
41638,Lisa,"uh-oh. should i laugh? was that dry british wit? or subtle self-pity? ooh, they're staring at me, better respond."
50710,Lisa,"but at the kwik-e-mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register."
52449,Lisa,can i dye my shoes pink?
47717,Lisa,"now, i can't have toothpaste tonight."
43414,Lisa,"that's it! oh, mr. pigeon, i'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
46876,Lisa,what's so good about it?
45398,Lisa,"you want me to join mensa? oh, that's wonderful. but don't i have to take some sort of i.q. test?"
41811,Lisa,"sorry, sir. it's just that..."
44378,Lisa,"well, at least they're talking to me..."
46941,Lisa,"dad, it's just a bug."
48110,Lisa,having a robot brother troubles me. the ethical implications are really tensing me up.
47347,Lisa,"no, dad. this time you were just plain selfish."
51803,Lisa,should we hug?
52078,Lisa,with all our hearts!
43808,Lisa,"uh, grampa, maybe i should moisten your washcloth..."
50043,Lisa,"are you sure about that, grampa?"
48231,Lisa,and...?
50441,Lisa,"no problem, just some cobwebs."
44974,Lisa,no doubt! can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
50394,Lisa,"bart, this is a truffle."
46035,Lisa,dad?? the panda was you?
49094,Lisa,my movie got in! i'm going to the sundance film festival!
46709,Lisa,you guys are so cool. i can't believe i never met you before.
46234,Lisa,"no, dad! didn't you listen to anything i said?"
52125,Lisa,i can feel an evil presence in this house.
51700,Lisa,parking lot.
45180,Lisa,"wait, there's a commercial!"
46262,Lisa,"your work has really inspired me, doctor. and i love your sensible ponytail."
49441,Lisa,for years... for years...
41643,Lisa,my first kiss! i always wondered what it would be like!
44349,Lisa,they're discussing poetry! oh! we never do that at my school!
49340,Lisa,"finally, a real suggestion!"
48067,Lisa,the land of the wild beasts? that's the first book i read all the way through.
49410,Lisa,how 'bout italian?
43364,Lisa,"hey mom, is this how you caught him?"
50971,Lisa,what happened with the e.m.p.?
45550,Lisa,not lenny!
49048,Lisa,"bart, are you all right?"
41970,Lisa,"maybe not, but i bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""property of bart simpson"" label on that radio."
47532,Lisa,we come from the real world.
44593,Lisa,ding ding ding ding ding...
48008,Lisa,yay!
47132,Lisa,"i can't believe luke has another gal. ""my name is clara... i've known luke for more than five days..."""
50407,Lisa,"oh, so that's why they don't give pigs truffles."
46523,Lisa,mmm...
49286,Lisa,"i've already downloaded so much incredible music! check out ""moon dreams"" from miles davis' ""birth of the cool."""
45172,Lisa,but it's not fair. adults always blame kids for everything!
51932,Lisa,"does, too."
49607,Lisa,although there were a few holes in the story.
49807,Lisa,she wasn't a slave owner! our family was on the underground railroad!
49602,Lisa,"because a woman shouldn't have to depend on a man. snow white was brought back to life, by a lady doctor."
47942,Lisa,"wow, krishna krisps, amazonkers, lollapalollipops -- these sound like my kind of snacks..."
52515,Lisa,"eh, why not?"
51178,Lisa,wait... you named me after a train?
41773,Lisa,"oh! this is the best present i ever got. thank you, bart. thank you michael."
49328,Lisa,"oh, they've found a home."
50406,Lisa,"bart, you've done a truly kind thing."
47342,Lisa,"no, dad. i mean you should use your time on the air to say things that really mean something. change the world for the better!"
47845,Lisa,"listen, people!"
44519,Lisa,just let me take it to the museum for one day. they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
45551,Lisa,"hey, there was no accident at the plant. dad just wanted to go bowling!"
51759,Lisa,really? but i thought...
48190,Lisa,bravo! bravo! bravissimo!
42092,Lisa,i don't know. you?
45576,Lisa,"oh, a name with ""fun""? um... fungus, funzo, attila the fun..."
42140,Lisa,why didn't you go to dad?
45501,Lisa,don't! uh... um... it's low-fat!
42593,Lisa,no! no!
44253,Lisa,no one's pinching his legs.
45327,Lisa,"uh, more or less. hey, is that manna?"
47420,Lisa,geronimo!
46877,Lisa,bread tastes like clothes.
51556,Lisa,dad? did you just call?
46590,Lisa,this game makes no sense.
50600,Lisa,"well, you're not exactly my hero. i see you more as a cautionary tale."
46893,Lisa,"hey bart, you could nominate mrs. krabappel for an actual award, the teacher of the year. then she'll feel appreciated."
44534,Lisa,"i just think it's a fantasy. if you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
52283,Lisa,shaft.
52461,Lisa,got a new dance and it goes like this / and the name of the dance is the peppermint twist! yeah!
52149,Lisa,"bart, he's establishing mood."
41921,Lisa,you're gonna make me give up princess?
44134,Lisa,why is that mirror sneezing?
44458,Lisa,all right. go ahead.
42957,Lisa,oh yeah. they weren't very funny.
46784,Lisa,"...poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
44357,Lisa,apparently tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
48389,Lisa,"and i did get better at math, but it was only by abandoning everything i believed in. i guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is..."
49456,Lisa,hm...
42425,Lisa,hamster one... bart... zero.
44628,Lisa,but we heard them hovering!
52530,Lisa,"you know, i was thinking of taking a poetry class at the community college."
44426,Lisa,i'm lisa!
45136,Lisa,i guess i don't have much choice.
43011,Lisa,one --
42089,Lisa,whattaya got?
42821,Lisa,i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
44744,Lisa,"oh dad, i've never been happier to be your daughter."
46999,Lisa,thank you! i've never felt more accepted. perhaps one day people who spell correctly will replace athletes at the top of our national pantheon.
49652,Lisa,"oh, did the chosen one hurt his chosen little noggin?"
49517,Lisa,we don't want your cookies.
45446,Lisa,"dad, we didn't come halfway around the world to eat at americatown."
44800,Lisa,"what does that even mean? mom might not see through you, but i do. you don't care about any of these people."
49165,Lisa,toora loora loora
49440,Lisa,"we have totality, people!"
43686,Lisa,"hi, mr. hurlbut."
41702,Lisa,nothing.
51742,Lisa,why does the last thing you say sound so ominous?
47726,Lisa,i guess. but there's a long way to go.
48101,Lisa,"okay look, you and mom can fix this. what exactly happened between the two of you?"
49372,Lisa,you know what i think killed this place? no one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams.
43321,Lisa,it must be awful to be all alone in the world.
51300,Lisa,oh.
50133,Lisa,it's something you've never seen: they're smitten.
42748,Lisa,"dad and ned flanders friends? what's next... ""a's"" on bart's report card?"
42324,Lisa,"no, mom, it's very reassuring. and i've learned a great deal from this cow's heart i got at the butcher shop."
41814,Lisa,"i would like to read a different essay, if i may."
44009,Lisa,nelson! um... that note milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. it was from... me.
45439,Lisa,yay! the simpsons are going to japan!
52166,Lisa,our lives have taken an odd turn.
47601,Lisa,the perfect kiss!
51792,Lisa,"what's wrong, dad?"
43516,Lisa,"hey, springfield! are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? then take a tip from mr. paul anka..."
42113,Lisa,"uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
47785,Lisa,"well, we're supposed to do this without parental help."
51398,Lisa,"if bart's going, i'm going!"
48702,Lisa,"great. the one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life."
45145,Lisa,"oh, come on."
48813,Lisa,"dad, i think someone's trying to kill you!"
49912,Lisa,"she's such a beautiful shade of blue... i'm going to call you bluella the whale."""
45906,Lisa,"dad, i want to go to bed. aren't there child labor laws?"
43018,Lisa,"bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. except maybe that boy who works in the library."
49952,Lisa,"currently. however, solar and wind are..."
49634,Lisa,"i never said ""kill!"""
45267,Lisa,squeaking that chair!
48934,Lisa,the radio lets me contribute directly to npr.
47906,Lisa,"ah, rats."
42823,Lisa,"i'll tell you a secret, bart. every time i'm worried about mom and dad, i go to the attic and add to my ball of string."
52233,Lisa,yes.
42203,Lisa,why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
50713,Lisa,"just throw in a couple of ""fur is murders."""
47312,Lisa,this is even worse than you think -- look!
48589,Lisa,"papa, may we have petit fours?"
43730,Lisa,"mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. and dad's upstairs."
46948,Lisa,bye mom!
45343,Lisa,you papier mache'd my cat?!
43022,Lisa,"bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
49742,Lisa,"i agree it's cliché, but she does have a certain-- unicorn!"
46071,Lisa,it looks like a sturgeon.
45712,Lisa,"thank you, mr. president!"
49108,Lisa,nelson? he couldn't have made a movie by himself. who helped him?
43118,Lisa,well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
47097,Lisa,concert in golden gate park.
44873,Lisa,i didn't know springfield had a russian district.
47331,Lisa,and then we got him neutered.
44273,Lisa,where's santa's little helper?
47156,Lisa,"according to this contract, we have to change his name to ""suds mcduff."""
51259,Lisa,i got bart's backpack.
52450,Lisa,can i paint my nails?
49408,Lisa,why does he think alfred's friends with batman?
51753,Lisa,"now do you see why i'm a vegetarian, dad?"
48168,Lisa,thank you. i've been studying. i even made flash cards!
42237,Lisa,i'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes?
50464,Lisa,that's where the ice bridge would be! go down!
51125,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so i made cookies. but i didn't know what kind you liked, so i made you seven kinds. i've become my mother! well, common sense never goes out of style that was too easy!"
41641,Lisa,"he's not like anybody i've ever met. he's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. he sure is ugly, though. so why can't i stop staring at him?"
43437,Lisa,they're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. i wish i could tell them how much i miss them.
47911,Lisa,can't breathe... someone dangle some string!
43716,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was... jebediah was... great. i, um, just wanted to say that i've done some research and, uh, he was great."
46507,Lisa,thank you.
50059,Lisa,"principal skinner, i need to convince nelson to come back to school."
41840,Lisa,"dad, i think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and larry king."
47050,Lisa,what about you and mom?
48778,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
50855,Lisa,"yes, it's the preferred term. and most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. but some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
44741,Lisa,"that means you went to college, right?"
43864,Lisa,it must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
43157,Lisa,"it never spins the other way. in the northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. it's called the coriolis effect."
46216,Lisa,"mr. tatum, do you mind if i swab you with this damp rag?"
43534,Lisa,"well, where's my dad?"
47996,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen, i have a confession to make. i didn't have my usual songwriter tonight..."
44308,Lisa,i'd love to -- partner!
52430,Lisa,"mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?"
41777,Lisa,"where did you get the idea for this, mom?"
41799,Lisa,"hello, sir."
52319,Lisa,"thanks, mom. it doesn't seem to be going very well."
44618,Lisa,dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.
45497,Lisa,i'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
45893,Lisa,shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
48074,Lisa,grampa?
45955,Lisa,i'm so conflicted.
42836,Lisa,dad...
46907,Lisa,huh?
42728,Lisa,"no you're not! uh, i'll come back tomorrow."
42066,Lisa,you stink strawberry. we want home-run homer!
48056,Lisa,saving!
46958,Lisa,i'unno. buddha?
42898,Lisa,it's great. it's really great.
43737,Lisa,i give up. there's nothing we can do.
49648,Lisa,"dad, no! that's the last book in the world!"
52411,Lisa,"my god, she's been dumped again."
52467,Lisa,merry christmas from the simpsons!
43113,Lisa,beware the ides of march.
51285,Lisa,dad! maggie's rolling away!
46633,Lisa,uh-oh.
49381,Lisa,danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop.
44926,Lisa,i like school.
47029,Lisa,what a sight! it happens every year like the swallows returning to capistrano.
48379,Lisa,"fine, i'll beat up ralph."
42052,Lisa,yeah?
49451,Lisa,why would mother superior lie to me about not having maggie? what is going on?
50863,Lisa,you tossed your car keys in my bean plant!
52299,Lisa,"everything i know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
51492,Lisa,"oh my god, he's in the walls!"
47082,Lisa,"oh, stop."
45563,Lisa,"dad, they have those everywhere."
46037,Lisa,"so, this is your mysterious new job for mr. burns?"
47321,Lisa,and bart's missing too!
43388,Lisa,"yeah, i was just getting to me. because of mr. burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend tito puente got fired. but i could never shoot someone."
41766,Lisa,"bart, in the split second before he died, i bet scratchy appreciated his birthday present. you see how this relates to us?"
44490,Lisa,why is that woman still living here?
52448,Lisa,can i get my ears pierced?
51084,Lisa,"good news, bad news. we're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you..."
51047,Lisa,and it's got no pluto! how cutting edge!
44329,Lisa,wow.
52247,Lisa,stop!
44248,Lisa,"hello, world's worst babysitter speaking."
46980,Lisa,shhh.
50896,Lisa,shoo!
46809,Lisa,what? i've gotta be in the same class as him?
41682,Lisa,"diphthongs, cognates, latin roots / lisa clobbers all you fruits!"
43184,Lisa,"bart, i am so proud of you. you showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. from this day forward we are kindred spirits."
47092,Lisa,"it worked -- i got my sky back! dad, look!"
43678,Lisa,"the next time hans sprüngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to jebediah springfield."
46549,Lisa,"hey, where's our parents?"
51960,Lisa,i was just playing the blues... ...dad.
45413,Lisa,"well, there's no one more learned than us..."
41933,Lisa,"but, dad, i can't find ""happy little elves in tinkly winkly town""."
43068,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. what is she saying you did?"
47827,Lisa,this proves bart lied about being kidnapped!
44804,Lisa,oh-how-terrible-read-on.
45175,Lisa,"ooh, ""the game of lent."""
47448,Lisa,"it used to be the ""leaning tower of pizza."""
48176,Lisa,"sono cosí matto a lei! ho pensato abbiamo avuto qualcosa andando, e poi la prendo con questa sgualdrina! lei me fa malato!"
43689,Lisa,i'm not going to give up. i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
51526,Lisa,"hey, dad."
49913,Lisa,"c'mon, everybody! a whale needs help!"
49076,Lisa,the man is an idiot!
44739,Lisa,i'm adopted?
42271,Lisa,"mom, they expect you to lie a little."
50480,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
49169,Lisa,what'd you get for me?
49932,Lisa,bluella?
44595,Lisa,no! then who'd chop off my hands?
52241,Lisa,"oh, bart, i hope you're not taking this seriously. even a five-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet."
46079,Lisa,"i know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. but, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. you see..."
52000,Lisa,"ready for inspection, mom."
42522,Lisa,"two wrongs don't make a right, bart."
44910,Lisa,wow! this is the best anniversary ever.
42383,Lisa,"oh no, it's ralph! just make some excuse."
43406,Lisa,better... look... burns... suit.
48224,Lisa,"oh no, bart blamed this on the dog! i didn't pet him for weeks! oh, i'm sorry i doubted you, boy."
45883,Lisa,"dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!"
49637,Lisa,you're a monster!
44735,Lisa,"and please don't deprive yourself of wonderful books like ""to kill a mockingbird"", ""harriet the spy"", and ""yertle the turtle"", possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle-stacking..."
50032,Lisa,i came to share in the esteem that the world bestows on its artists.
48908,Lisa,"c'mon lis, hop on the wiggum wagon. ralph said he'd let me be secretary of indian burns. here's my first official act:"
46240,Lisa,yayyy!
49244,Lisa,"in my young life i've seen that every time i'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" and another little piece says ""i agree."""
47674,Lisa,hmmm.
50470,Lisa,"otto, they're just mannequins!"
46500,Lisa,"oh sure, you take his side. just 'cause he bought you that house on st. james place."
44225,Lisa,bart! you need first aid! let me in!
42650,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
48927,Lisa,a story suitable for children!
47511,Lisa,"oh god, oh god. oh nooo. if i don't make it out alive, i love you, mom and dad. maggie, you can have my books. and bart, i'll see you in hell, you booger-eating wuss. that's right, we all know!"
46274,Lisa,"meet linguo, the grammar robot. i built him all by myself. if you misuse language, he'll correct you."
51344,Lisa,"what am i doing? untent! untent! oh bart, i want to win, but not like this. i'm sorry. you're fired!"
44902,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. and just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
44945,Lisa,"careful, now. nobody likes a showoff."
46302,Lisa,hmmm... it's noon -- that's about when dad gets the brew-shakes.
44051,Lisa,"let's just call it ""smell ya later."""
48332,Lisa,"i keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
52102,Lisa,"okay, but you have to untie me first."
43108,Lisa,"what do they do there, dad?"
43375,Lisa,tutoring? the only thing bart's teaching is guerilla combat in shelbyville.
45017,Lisa,"dad, those should be your millions."
47003,Lisa,"well, i'm just happy you guys all came up here to calgary with me."
43496,Lisa,"wow, a secret staircase? but what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
42063,Lisa,"wow, dad."
50095,Lisa,don't call me honey pie.
42718,Lisa,i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of malibu stacy.
44565,Lisa,nothing could be as fun as that looks.
49943,Lisa,it's the baby whales' dad!
50873,Lisa,bart! what are you doing in my room?!
42471,Lisa,finished. now all we have to do is put our names on it.
47181,Lisa,i see you braves received our smoke signal.
46864,Lisa,"well, you saved krusty's reputation."
43205,Lisa,"hey, watch it! / watch it!"
44985,Lisa,you don't understand. i don't belong there. the other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating. they make me feel like a little baby.
43384,Lisa,"sorry, grampa. it's just that, for a second, it looked like dad had melted."
47246,Lisa,this cute-ing-up suits me / there's beauty within me / so let's olsen-twin me / give them someone to love
48800,Lisa,you're our hero!
45909,Lisa,swings!
46017,Lisa,"oh mom, those loggers chopped down the tree! why did i have to leave my post?"
51760,Lisa,right. conquering.
41649,Lisa,"beh! mag-gie! hey, hey, get your sticky hands off me. owww!"
49499,Lisa,"well, ireland is at the forefront of europe's tech boom."
42913,Lisa,"hey, ralph. want to come with me and allison to play anagrams?"
42410,Lisa,i thought you'd like it.
50781,Lisa,"let's see... ""uncensored jump-rope chants""... oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""lisa simpson!"""
46155,Lisa,you're being brainwashed.
47589,Lisa,"dad, this is the basement. here's the iced tea i left down here this afternoon."
44835,Lisa,where in the world did you find a sled on top of the--
49452,Lisa,a jewel! why would nuns want a jewel?
47041,Lisa,no! connect!
48387,Lisa,that's a lie!
51442,Lisa,"well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people."
45604,Lisa,season's greetings.
49427,Lisa,did you remember to disconnect it first?
42954,Lisa,"mom, that's veal."
43785,Lisa,"there's something troubling me, dad...but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret."
42399,Lisa,noooo!!
47758,Lisa,"you're so smart, chloe!"
52258,Lisa,there's peas everywhere.
49315,Lisa,"mr. burns, you can't do this!"
45507,Lisa,so you were going to kill us.
43597,Lisa,i'll be lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
49488,Lisa,"it's really maggie, sherlock. you know, i have to point out that this anagram only works if i get the wrong answer first."
46294,Lisa,sorry. i was rushing because i'm in the wrong school. can you believe that?
51184,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom!"
51260,Lisa,he got a hundred on his test?! that's impossible!
41963,Lisa,is it sherri?
49686,Lisa,they didn't blind anyone -- i have proof!
52284,Lisa,shaft.
44472,Lisa,"hey, tubby. want another pop-tart, tubby?"
44257,Lisa,but 7 goes into 28 4 times.
52370,Lisa,"on the left is mr. largo, my music teacher at school. he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. and on the right is bleeding gums murphy. he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it."
42472,Lisa,no way.
50104,Lisa,"okay, everyone study two-out situations, count management, and i'll be back with some gluten-free crackers."
45757,Lisa,what are you doing here?
52481,Lisa,he took the boys out.
44834,Lisa,"family to dad. family to dad. come in, dad!"
51859,Lisa,"""id. along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
48792,Lisa,world.
48296,Lisa,mother-flippers? what's this show about?
49977,Lisa,how shortened?
51363,Lisa,"good one, ding dong!"
43872,Lisa,i don't see any kids at all. it's like they ditched me in advance.
42313,Lisa,"ha, ha. mom yelled at you."
51025,Lisa,"now remember, i can't sit backwards or i get sick."
48879,Lisa,"i see no grill, oven, or food of any kind."
49884,Lisa,"hey, they're not eating."
44368,Lisa,why'd you say that?
42248,Lisa,you said he went bowling!
49335,Lisa,"so, how come i've never seen you around the janet l. muñoz-robbins rec center before?"
49366,Lisa,i can't see juliet anymore?! i thought you wanted me to have a best friend.
43356,Lisa,i got the album!
49894,Lisa,"as in ""little orphan."""
49514,Lisa,fine. but how do you explain this?
46892,Lisa,and you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
42188,Lisa,"hey look, it's last year's winner, deborah jo smallwood!"
46222,Lisa,"my study is entitled ""airborne pheromones and aggression in bullies""."
45039,Lisa,but then we're stuck with gorillas!
43722,Lisa,"what happened, dad?"
51589,Lisa,neither do you!
51920,Lisa,tell me more.
42367,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
51689,Lisa,but you just said that--
49074,Lisa,"oh, that's a funny joke, mr. kinkaid. is this an art class or a comedy class? seriously, why is it three?"
41671,Lisa,"oh my god, you've been challenged! well lisa, let's see how you respond."
41879,Lisa,"oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
45852,Lisa,sorry. i'm just frustrated.
42293,Lisa,but i'm a real tightwad. can i afford this remarkable system?
52032,Lisa,"female carrier, bart."
42160,Lisa,"oh miss hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. you gave me a b+ in conduct."
45607,Lisa,all is calm / all is bright / round...
47044,Lisa,"dad, this is a kid's menu where you help yogi bear get to the washington monument."
45499,Lisa,"dad, no!"
50062,Lisa,"oh, i don't know. i thought one of these super-successful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school. why look, it's mark zuckerberg, the founder of facebook!"
44903,Lisa,"thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, dad."
43720,Lisa,"bart, leave simpson alone."
46786,Lisa,i guess guns really are the answer.
45744,Lisa,it's going into that building.
47639,Lisa,"all right, nelson. what kind of journalism skills do you have?"
44385,Lisa,hey!!
46619,Lisa,let us kill the english! their concept of individual rights could undermine the power of our beloved tyrants!
45060,Lisa,"oh, geez!"
48329,Lisa,the year was sixteen twenty...
41610,Lisa,bart's making faces!
44570,Lisa,bail out!
44638,Lisa,she's really hungry.
47635,Lisa,"publish it myself? why not? i could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. i'd be a publisher, just like katherine graham!"
46170,Lisa,"it's okay, but it's missing a piece."
49454,Lisa,you mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? that's so cool.
46767,Lisa,yay!
52339,Lisa,watch me dive! watch me dive! watch me dive!
43849,Lisa,"you know something, beezee? i think you're right."
50110,Lisa,"here's what: you're off the team! get him outta here, boys."
45076,Lisa,you might as well. you already made up a phony film credit.
51297,Lisa,"new kid? um, have you made any friends?"
45326,Lisa,"hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert."
42278,Lisa,aaah!
48556,Lisa,why are you stopping? we're almost at the happy ending!
46802,Lisa,"no, sorry."
47908,Lisa,they're saying springfielders are stupid hicks.
41636,Lisa,"they're only using you for your pool, you know."
48359,Lisa,what're you playing?
48840,Lisa,way to get rid of bart. he can be such a pest.
52360,Lisa,very impressive!
50884,Lisa,"dad, please!"
46406,Lisa,"how'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, moe?"
51276,Lisa,"lisa. guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team?"
51636,Lisa,she's under a lot of stress. her husband's at sea.
49781,Lisa,a dime? what do you think i am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
47792,Lisa,mr. burns acting nice? that's odd. he must be up to something.
47023,Lisa,wha?
50969,Lisa,you said you cut the wires to the alarm!
48940,Lisa,now you two play nice!
51095,Lisa,"i move that you dismiss this case, and release this sweet, lovable boy."
47300,Lisa,"dad, no! you turned into a roundabout!"
48989,Lisa,tv! tv! tv!
51153,Lisa,have you no shame?
44578,Lisa,i guess we better get used to being pariahs.
42699,Lisa,"thanks. ""mr. simpson. stop. your constant letters are becoming a nuisance. stop. if you do not cease, i will be forced to pursue legal action. stop. signed, boris karloff, hollywood, california."""
43575,Lisa,he framed krusty. he tried to kill aunt selma. he rigged an election.
46223,Lisa,"for as long as there have been smart people, there have been bullies to prey on them. from galileo...to sir isaac newton...and even in the animal kingdom..."
52091,Lisa,"bart, you're just like chilly, the elf who cannot love."
43576,Lisa,wow! / air show! / cool! /
50889,Lisa,get outta here!
45068,Lisa,ready.
46639,Lisa,a hundred and fifty-six million.
43922,Lisa,ow!
45195,Lisa,it is to me.
46837,Lisa,what do you care?
52154,Lisa,"my brother's using worms but i who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing."
45872,Lisa,stop clapping!
44642,Lisa,"not now, martin."
50853,Lisa,it's a black hole!
47032,Lisa,they must have moved the flight paths over our house.
46724,Lisa,this place is amazing! kiosks! outdoor study groups!
46245,Lisa,when do we get to see the animals?
42207,Lisa,"dad, do you think i'm ugly?"
51253,Lisa,"hello, children. i hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code."
49193,Lisa,huh.
50277,Lisa,"something wrong, bart?"
41687,Lisa,where's mr. bergstrom?
46873,Lisa,but where will we live?
44886,Lisa,what?
46257,Lisa,"oh, no! we're headed for victoria falls!"
47217,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, sorry!"
46168,Lisa,but you made it out of ham cubes.
44525,Lisa,inconclusive? then why did you come running up like that?
43314,Lisa,bleeding gums murphy!
52012,Lisa,"well, i think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better."
46094,Lisa,it's true!
50124,Lisa,no! the computer says it's statistically impossible!
44231,Lisa,911
46827,Lisa,i spearheaded this one.
46933,Lisa,i don't wanna eat from the trash.
49190,Lisa,that was an odd thing for bart to say.
45509,Lisa,bart!
43319,Lisa,he'll be fine.
50835,Lisa,at least i'm with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.
51386,Lisa,"okay bart, open your present. it's the one i'm most excited about."
42938,Lisa,"sorry, mom. i've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me."
50607,Lisa,we're not with him.
44976,Lisa,really? all of you?
46404,Lisa,"you did it, moe!"
42777,Lisa,"dad, feline means cat."
49529,Lisa,"oh, go ahead -- numb me."
48917,Lisa,"dad, i'm freezing."
44847,Lisa,"oh, all right."
49476,Lisa,great...
48010,Lisa,my good-girl points!
50669,Lisa,"this place is great! if i cover my peripheral vision, i feel like i'm in france!"
43209,Lisa,no. it couldn't be...
51916,Lisa,"oh, brother."
44004,Lisa,"but i bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. i guess you could say i want to bring out the milhouse in nelson."
50737,Lisa,"well bart, i guess that's our cue to skedaddle..."
52432,Lisa,"yesterday, he read us ""charlotte's web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
51542,Lisa,"oh, well, you're very wel--"
42090,Lisa,"uh, i'll smoke it in class."
48130,Lisa,"the unicorns are you and me, dad. i drew it myself."
43798,Lisa,"no, i've got gum in my hair!"
42031,Lisa,i suspected as much.
47260,Lisa,key release boilerplate? i find that very hard to believe.
48015,Lisa,"dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. yet. a hundred years, global warming... we're goners. but for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
44742,Lisa,so all the simpson women turn out okay?
44269,Lisa,"what've you got for me, boy? hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat."
46340,Lisa,back to normal.
43438,Lisa,yay!
48027,Lisa,that's what we've been trying to tell you!
46728,Lisa,where is everybody?
44166,Lisa,you cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! that's what happened.
44090,Lisa,"hi, mr. smithers!"
45920,Lisa,hey!
42080,Lisa,what's so good about it....
49121,Lisa,"you know, it's a boy dolphin."
49564,Lisa,principal skinner?
47650,Lisa,"they're so beautiful. and their breath smells like peppermint! no! no! i won't take your blood ponies! go on, sweetie. go on. shoo!"
52081,Lisa,"uh-oh, school bus."
46867,Lisa,"this is a joke. you'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood."
43690,Lisa,"i'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
41867,Lisa,"excuse us, rabbi krustofsky?"
46620,Lisa,you can't stop me! i was sent by god!
47971,Lisa,there's tires / on fire / a guy named apu
50430,Lisa,"dad, our lives!"
44546,Lisa,"well, it was just so loud and... heh, heh, heh... thanks for sqeezing back."
42020,Lisa,"so you've come to buy my forgiveness. sorry, homer."
47668,Lisa,"this is so sweet, but i've learned one little paper can't make a difference in this world."
48241,Lisa,i think he's got it! oh yes he's got it!
51166,Lisa,samurai shampoo blast!
49827,Lisa,"computers, right? our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named eliza simpson."
49530,Lisa,"well, off to school where they'll prepare our little minds for a future we'll never see."
52177,Lisa,"and i'm studying for the math fair. if i win, i'll bring home a brand new protractor."
47583,Lisa,thank you mysterious stranger... where did he go?
43747,Lisa,santa?
50970,Lisa,"dad, there are lights following us!"
47095,Lisa,i wonder what mom came up with for this week's 'family wednesday.'
51052,Lisa,fur?!
43309,Lisa,"well, my teacher's a nightmare. three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener."
47403,Lisa,"""everybody poops, the video?"" ""yu-gi-oh price guides?"" there are hardly any books at all!"
48412,Lisa,"last week, the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools."
49533,Lisa,"if you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!"
51413,Lisa,they're giant polluters but the c.e.o. is a woman. it's very vexing.
51757,Lisa,this system is really rigged against us.
46640,Lisa,"not if we buy our tickets on the internet. it's really cheap if we change planes in phoenix, honolulu, sun city, and east st. louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
46674,Lisa,"it worked, mom! maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness."
48326,Lisa,what about this swordfish?
52061,Lisa,"if cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time."
42055,Lisa,"sure it is. hey bart, let's do some homework."
43649,Lisa,i got their new thrifty saver savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. so a year from now i'll have an extra nickel.
49735,Lisa,"bart, i'm losing my grip!"
45938,Lisa,"hey, where are you going?"
46671,Lisa,"but seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years."
48888,Lisa,"look, that's sideshow bob's mother -- dame judith underdunk! she's the greatest classical actress of her generation."
48787,Lisa,and you're constantly flouting the law.
44512,Lisa,but it can't be an angel!
43750,Lisa,bart can take my place at the plant!
46766,Lisa,hm. does dad seem a little... dumber than usual?
48679,Lisa,"yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?"
50138,Lisa,"you're a vampire! i should be scared, but i'm not."
52338,Lisa,marco!
47328,Lisa,i tried the coat hanger again. i don't understand why we only try ideas once.
42428,Lisa,hampster two... bart zero...
51620,Lisa,"okay, enough theory."
51573,Lisa,i'm okay with no friends. it's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form i choose. right now i'm thinking long novella. goodnight!
46151,Lisa,yvan eht nioj? they keep saying that.
44670,Lisa,it's just a joke.
48450,Lisa,yes!
50858,Lisa,"dad, that's creepy."
48935,Lisa,"i never dreamed an american car designed in germany, assembled in mexico from parts made in canada, could be so amazing."
42126,Lisa,see for yourself.
52459,Lisa,"look everybody, maggie got her first tooth!"
52128,Lisa,mom! dad! look!
52142,Lisa,"well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?"
45250,Lisa,"look, they have lincoln's hat!"
49983,Lisa,"oh, bart. i am so glad everything's okay."
42079,Lisa,"dear log... this will be my last entry. for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now i have none."
46402,Lisa,you don't like me? i like you.
43919,Lisa,this tooth will be perfect for my science project.
50075,Lisa,sorry.
44252,Lisa,that's funny. i don't feel stupid.
47934,Lisa,"yay, mom!"
45498,Lisa,we can find him faster by splitting up. you take fried foods. you take salty snacks. i'll take desserts. break!
43983,Lisa,how was what? what?
43351,Lisa,"gee, your station has a lot of problems."
48282,Lisa,ready!
46284,Lisa,just come on.
50685,Lisa,we could take this boat.
49046,Lisa,banana bread!
48392,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
42785,Lisa,"just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that bart's absence has left in our hearts."
42192,Lisa,"big daddy, would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit?"
48093,Lisa,i think i'll be okay by myself.
44772,Lisa,"back off, bart. this may be the only chance i get as a second grader to produce my own tv show, and i'm not gonna let you screw it up."
49768,Lisa,but he does look lonely all by himself...
45052,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
44089,Lisa,really? let me see!
45730,Lisa,dad?
46905,Lisa,i wonder what this could be?
44923,Lisa,"uh, i was just trying to find dave barry's column."
45631,Lisa,"you know, the reason for the hat..."
49068,Lisa,anything?
42074,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. i've got it all figured out. i'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the french. i'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but i do plan to have several torrid love affairs. and i may or may not die young, i haven't decided."
46761,Lisa,wow. look at dad. people really respect him.
48566,Lisa,kinda.
44430,Lisa,"well, don't worry about me, dad. it's not how it looks, it's how it sounds."
51691,Lisa,i can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.
49740,Lisa,"so grampa, you really saved dad's life?"
50283,Lisa,"you can't listen to those women, mom. change threatens them. they didn't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color."
44697,Lisa,"mom, i think something's wrong with me. i can't do anything right lately."
44116,Lisa,do we have to?
43592,Lisa,mom! i found sideshow bob's hide-out and i got a secret message to the police and i had a blimp fall on me and i was in an atomic blast but i'm okay now!
46614,Lisa,"with modern ideas -- like putting bigger, harder people in the catapults. or how 'bout rocks?"
48572,Lisa,there he is!
42963,Lisa,just keep taking pictures.
44327,Lisa,it looks japanese.
42917,Lisa,happy valentine's.
44305,Lisa,you guys shouldn't laugh at him. mr. burns has changed. he's different now.
50931,Lisa,i've been meat-walking!
42210,Lisa,"i'd like to be alone, please."
49087,Lisa,"no, us!"
45664,Lisa,excellent.
47988,Lisa,dad... you're fired.
43935,Lisa,ba-rt stop it!
50099,Lisa,does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?
47446,Lisa,what's going on?
43100,Lisa,"dad, mom's getting worse. you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. look how tense she is."
48102,Lisa,where are you staying?
52045,Lisa,and the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
45408,Lisa,this is so cool. i feel like i'm back in the renaissance.
51500,Lisa,that's a terrible thing for a father to do.
42941,Lisa,dad! remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive?
45225,Lisa,"hey, give me some of that."
50715,Lisa,looks like dad's not coming.
45627,Lisa,"oh, mom. i've seen what you do around the house, and i can handle it. maybe i can even make things more efficient."
52070,Lisa,"bart, look!"
45375,Lisa,oh! ... on the radio.
48151,Lisa,"well, dad, you tried to make this town a better place. and no matter what, that makes you my hero."
47514,Lisa,mom! dad! there's a ghost in the house!
47655,Lisa,i guess we're down to just me.
49374,Lisa,equalia is not real!
44946,Lisa,where are they going?
44172,Lisa,bart!
42617,Lisa,"we know, dad."
42275,Lisa,i don't think we should be down here.
51451,Lisa,dad!
44612,Lisa,"oh, no! the spit valve! release the spit valve!"
47538,Lisa,did you guys get home at two last night?
48991,Lisa,no.
50833,Lisa,"now you listen to me, bart. milhouse may not be the perfect date..."
45609,Lisa,your toy company is evil.
42475,Lisa,"bart, they rejected our script."
43800,Lisa,that sounds okay...
50212,Lisa,huh. it's a pigeon.
50559,Lisa,"sitting in a coffee shop -- i couldn't feel more like a real writer! oh, better set up my wi-fi in case i need to do some research! but if i'm gonna use their free internet, i really should buy something."
51658,Lisa,"noble spirits, your time has passed."
44082,Lisa,you want an alien? this is your alien!
41660,Lisa,"oh my god, my social studies project is due tomorrow morning!"
46472,Lisa,"mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over..."
45748,Lisa,how much farther to the campground?
51614,Lisa,"bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did."
45411,Lisa,"please stay calm, everyone."
48063,Lisa,can i sleep with you guys tonight?
49558,Lisa,"oh, their school system's the best. their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms!"
42926,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
50945,Lisa,whoa.
46260,Lisa,this is the place i've read about! where dr. bushwell lives among the chimps!
48403,Lisa,how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory?
42075,Lisa,can you tell me if i have what it takes to be a blues musician?
45629,Lisa,don't tell me mom dresses you.
47946,Lisa,"these new vending machine snacks are crammed with processed sugar, industrial byproducts and trans-fatty acids!"
48860,Lisa,i got dolphin.
49845,Lisa,"well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. in politics it's called a ""wedge issue"" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage."
47849,Lisa,"people, please! i'm talking about toxic vapors."
44381,Lisa,"i can't, they're stuck."
41734,Lisa,"perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
50478,Lisa,face on a dime!
45848,Lisa,nope.
52209,Lisa,"bart, cut it out!"
45456,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, dad. buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the earth's supply... you're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?"
49242,Lisa,"dad, i could actually win this thing!"
49129,Lisa,we can ignite it with these crystal earrings grandma gave me.
49747,Lisa,it's still on / in my head / it will be there till i'm dead...
46756,Lisa,"mom, dad, someone stole my malibu stacy collection!"
43557,Lisa,"this is so weird. it's like something out of dickens or ""melrose place."""
46196,Lisa,well i'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. check out these indian burns.
52200,Lisa,dad!
43464,Lisa,what's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
44963,Lisa,"aren't we a little young for makeup and... what do you mean, five pounds?"
44233,Lisa,wait! dr. hibbert!
49755,Lisa,just think what that game could do for grampa and his friends!
47539,Lisa,and why is krusty on the couch?
47683,Lisa,thank you for applying to the ovenfresh bakeoff. every year many wonderful cooks fail to qualify.
50179,Lisa,i'm so exci--
41964,Lisa,"how do you mean, dad?"
47929,Lisa,"bart, maybe you should listen to this."
45489,Lisa,bon appetit.
47986,Lisa,"but dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people."
48823,Lisa,you clicked the cart!
51734,Lisa,"whoa, this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars."
49663,Lisa,you're gonna be so embarrassed. there are two other people at this party dressed just like you.
48177,Lisa,grazie. idioto!
49471,Lisa,because i cleverly deduced the answer to springfield's biggest ring. voila!
42315,Lisa,"huh, okay."
43355,Lisa,oh thank you. but five hundred dollars! you'll never see that much money again!
41763,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
48277,Lisa,"my pearl necklace! i must have lost it, and you were just bringing it back to me."
43616,Lisa,"now you are the one who is ""it."""
42580,Lisa,"no, no, they're wrong! the creature they seek is the walking undead. nosferatu! das wampyre!"
46349,Lisa,don't forget apple sauce.
48187,Lisa,how did you wind up here?
50642,Lisa,"nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!"
50504,Lisa,"fine. good luck with your project, which i'm sure you haven't started yet."
45387,Lisa,"well, most of us."
49110,Lisa,"thank you, mr. jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than i do."
46621,Lisa,i want my mommy!
50243,Lisa,"see? every time we get a tree, mom disappears!"
49392,Lisa,homer simpson...
48894,Lisa,his mother was a shakespearean actress!
51986,Lisa,no.
45538,Lisa,no thanks. i'm still finishing my thistles.
45189,Lisa,"adults! / you're such a drooling snoring, boozing boring bunch / surly, meanie, three-martini lunch-ers."
45542,Lisa,i thought you said it tasted terrible.
43449,Lisa,hmmm... pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
49341,Lisa,"hi, juliet."
44988,Lisa,i'll go.
48434,Lisa,"no, it's great! except for the bee!"
44509,Lisa,"oh, my goodness."
45534,Lisa,are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
44203,Lisa,"come on, maggie... good maggie... the talcum powder's not to play with..."
48954,Lisa,we-were-never-outside-we-were-here-all-day.
42526,Lisa,he's a big tv star.
50453,Lisa,that's us. do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
48319,Lisa,"aw dad, we'll miss you so much."
50673,Lisa,"mom, i have a crush!"
43790,Lisa,...and bart could be the courier!
46956,Lisa,and there are so many places to cloister myself!
42359,Lisa,"yes, principal skinner."
42087,Lisa,"okay, but if you really want to honk skinner off, i suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in."
49933,Lisa,no. i'm not gonna be disappointed again.
51359,Lisa,what are you getting at?
46624,Lisa,"don't worry, beloved parents. god won't let anything happen to me."
43970,Lisa,"hey, that reminds me, mom -- buckingham palace called. they want their hat back."
44600,Lisa,"oh boy! / all right, free money! / wow!"
49832,Lisa,but i need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to colonel burns!
45324,Lisa,"all right, moses, lead your people."
47298,Lisa,sir ian mckellen! you're my favorite shakespearean actor!
52211,Lisa,"dad, this isn't about glue. it's about territoriality. he only wants the glue because i'm using it."
41631,Lisa,but how?
42675,Lisa,why? i'm so much happier here.
49509,Lisa,that's the angry one.
46043,Lisa,"forget about him, dad. i'm proud of you."
51213,Lisa,dad!
49138,Lisa,wha... but...
49759,Lisa,why is the tv back on? what happened to the videogame?
44306,Lisa,"mr. burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. you have to show them they're appreciated."
41727,Lisa,"it's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
50234,Lisa,"oh, i know what you're after. the toy you never got."
52079,Lisa,"bart, there's one left and it's mine!"
45314,Lisa,i thought you were just a marketing gimmick.
49701,Lisa,because you envy us. maggie and i share the deepest bond there is: sisterhood.
50828,Lisa,a peloton?
52174,Lisa,"mom, what's he doing wrong?"
48178,Lisa,idioto! idioto! idioto!
47560,Lisa,where are you?! are you okay?
44073,Lisa,out back.
48143,Lisa,"oh, yeah."
51083,Lisa,"that's right! bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids. mostly these kids. there's only so many kids."
50280,Lisa,i can't take it. i'm just going to draw a hairline on.
45402,Lisa,"but ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome."
42353,Lisa,i am the lizard queen!
43231,Lisa,"it's not you, milhouse. i just don't plan to ever get married."
51360,Lisa,"huh. you hear that world?! they love my ideas, just not me! and that is half the battle! ha!"
45691,Lisa,hey!
50389,Lisa,"sold, to the lowest bidder!"
44352,Lisa,yes.
46971,Lisa,"bart, where are you gonna live?"
48422,Lisa,it's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.
42521,Lisa,"yeah, well krusty stole it from steve allen."
49962,Lisa,the end.
46238,Lisa,there's gotta be something to eat in this house.
50536,Lisa,"wow mom, that was awesome!"
43149,Lisa,i can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that i've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
51081,Lisa,wow -- he passed the maggie test. and remember how maggie solved cookiegate?
47958,Lisa,and if that diamond ring turns brass / mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
52219,Lisa,"hey, bart, stop it!"
46541,Lisa,"dad, you've gotta do something."
45654,Lisa,lucy?
43679,Lisa,you do?
50774,Lisa,"bart, aren't you gonna tell mom and dad about the problem you have?"
46480,Lisa,"well, santa can take it back because i'm not ruled by material desi-- is that a pony?"
49167,Lisa,"hey, what are those boxes in the back?"
46629,Lisa,and that's the greatest thing ever written.
44767,Lisa,"oh, my gosh! today's top story: ""little girl on cloud nine as dream comes true."""
51020,Lisa,really? who?
46102,Lisa,"ah, now for a little powder blue."
49750,Lisa,why is everyone staring at static?
48474,Lisa,i feel so terrible. i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer... but i never thought the two stories would intersect.
52446,Lisa,"oh, mom, that's wonderful. can i find out his favorite dish and help you make it!"
44925,Lisa,krusty's speak and say?
43898,Lisa,"i know exactly who i am. i am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak."
50172,Lisa,should i get the nurse?
47733,Lisa,technically he was born in shelbyville.
51865,Lisa,how 'bout this: supervising technician at the toxic waste dump.
44262,Lisa,no.
48981,Lisa,"i almost flicked an innocent butterfly. bart, we're turning into monsters!"
48993,Lisa,so what happened?
45367,Lisa,why don't you finish your own darn...
41747,Lisa,"it's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. hump and dew-lap. hump and dew-lap."
51409,Lisa,and the worst one of all is--
43293,Lisa,but they're ours! you stole them from us!
50963,Lisa,"grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?"
45321,Lisa,"eh, slave labor. you get what you pay for."
42656,Lisa,you had a stamp collection?
43477,Lisa,come to homer's bbbq. the extra b is for byobb.
43004,Lisa,dad!! your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
47242,Lisa,you wanted to see me?
42347,Lisa,this is a disgrace.
43765,Lisa,ready!
44416,Lisa,"dad, you don't understand. this saxophone is like my oldest friend. i've had it for as long as i can remember."
51091,Lisa,but could bart have gotten those eggs?
49426,Lisa,"fine, but i wish you'd picked an easier theme than ""super-jet dinosaur fun-monkeys."" what does that even mean?"
46072,Lisa,how'd you do your act? you left your magic kit here.
50052,Lisa,"ooh, your first customer. be nice!"
51563,Lisa,lucas! you're not competitive eating anymore?
43043,Lisa,"you really think i did okay out there, mom?"
43334,Lisa,uh huh.
52522,Lisa,"ignore, ignore, ignore... ooh, martin prince is now ""marcia princess?"" no, i've got to find zia."
42119,Lisa,these talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on tv.
49819,Lisa,"martha, you are the best."
43687,Lisa,that's jebediah's secret confession. it proves he was a fraud.
45967,Lisa,daaaad!
47927,Lisa,don't you mean astronomy?
48156,Lisa,oh my god! spend a summer in rome!
52051,Lisa,your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. may i be excused?
47257,Lisa,"you mean i can come to the school after hours, weekends, even during the summer?"
51459,Lisa,but... but we sang gershwin together!
50229,Lisa,not really.
42387,Lisa,i'm not sure i should go. i don't even like him.
50275,Lisa,"maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money."
42741,Lisa,what?
46735,Lisa,what are you guys doing?
48363,Lisa,my name isn't toilet -- it's jake!
45620,Lisa,"don't worry, little friends. i won't hurt you."
44889,Lisa,"dad, are you all right?"
48469,Lisa,i'll take him too.
44488,Lisa,what's the deal with that dot?
47101,Lisa,"he's right, dad. we're missing that singer's head!"
50320,Lisa,so i guess the lesson here is...
49218,Lisa,maybe you could use some help.
52095,Lisa,"come on, come on."
43047,Lisa,"hey milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! jimbo! jimbo! go for the face! look! ralph wiggum lost his shin guard! hack the bone! hack the bone!"
43094,Lisa,"mom, are you feeling any better?"
50695,Lisa,"do we really have to sit here the whole time? i mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty."
50519,Lisa,"don't worry about it, mom. dad will take us on a great outing next weekend."
46366,Lisa,"bart, you're getting vomit on my prince. head zeppelin!"
41903,Lisa,"mom, where is he? if i don't get that reed i'll sound terrible."
51306,Lisa,franklin roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the new deal...
47230,Lisa,what?
44996,Lisa,kids?
50097,Lisa,"hey, dad."
42566,Lisa,"no you didn't. you only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
43244,Lisa,"okay, i've got something old - that's my pearl necklace. something new is the wedding dress. something borrowed is this antique brooch from hugh's mother. now i just need something blue."
41826,Lisa,"okay, okay."
45143,Lisa,"mom, don't."
49906,Lisa,"but dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from flanders."
43969,Lisa,"he's not a drifter, mom. that's mr. burns's son, larry."
51382,Lisa,"now dad, i'd like to give you your present."
42734,Lisa,"how about ""minerva,"" after the roman goddess of wisdom?"
51489,Lisa,i wish i could live in there.
45644,Lisa,"look, they're rusted through."
51751,Lisa,i thought it was a ball!
48391,Lisa,"dad, all you had to do was paint one number. now no one's gonna be able to find our house."
45095,Lisa,"no, pause, pause!"
45288,Lisa,i'll take two hours.
42723,Lisa,i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
42754,Lisa,"and i'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet. wanna come with me, daddy-o?"
49752,Lisa,wow! how long has the tv been out?
49018,Lisa,that's easy for you to say. you've never had to be thin and focused.
42175,Lisa,"our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a dickensian workhouse."
42549,Lisa,hello moe?
50403,Lisa,that baby's head.
48662,Lisa,"as always, i have some ideas."
48839,Lisa,can i weld that?
51784,Lisa,"he's taking your homer-isms and turning them into his own great ideas! this is the most inspirational moment of my life, but, unfortunately, this is my stop."
45255,Lisa,"ugh, that antenna is an eyesore."
51241,Lisa,"are you really, really sure?"
42318,Lisa,operation? what are you talking about?
48582,Lisa,it's not over yet!
46473,Lisa,i'm a buddhist.
42481,Lisa,"grampa, we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways."
47617,Lisa,"""congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."""
50753,Lisa,the penguin's life isn't all bad. those ones are having a blast!
46093,Lisa,it is!
51621,Lisa,krusty's getting roasted tonight.
45430,Lisa,"wow, dad, you're surfing like a pro."
47751,Lisa,"hello, u. n. women's conference!"
49821,Lisa,they made it back to the house?! how?!
49793,Lisa,thank you.
43643,Lisa,"i'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
45476,Lisa,it's good to have the old bart back. plus you exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's army.
50399,Lisa,brown gold... tuscan tea...
47042,Lisa,congressman.
44462,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
50051,Lisa,"well, whoever your mysterious donor is, he, or she, really wants you to succeed."
46687,Lisa,two million.
42859,Lisa,"mom, i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've got to practice!"
44395,Lisa,"hey, where's bart?"
51882,Lisa,"yes, you do!"
44807,Lisa,they gave you a chopper?!
50465,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
51825,Lisa,you never let me tell!
42735,Lisa,this is great! they're really gonna sell our doll.
44617,Lisa,"dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
49291,Lisa,"um, mr. mobbs... i sort of downloaded too many songs onto my mypod. and i don't have the money to pay for them. and... do you think you could consider a reduced payment plan?"
51128,Lisa,"milhouse, are you okay?"
44142,Lisa,i guess...
47204,Lisa,did a shark do that?
46065,Lisa,"mom, you're missing a great show."
43981,Lisa,"oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. and i think i know what it is..."
46529,Lisa,you do this every year. we are used to it.
46074,Lisa,is that a long island iced tea?
52083,Lisa,"oh, come on, bart, not again."
50173,Lisa,dad was right -- i might as well give up.
43778,Lisa,nobody does! he's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. but that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
45998,Lisa,i won't come down till you spare this tree!
44220,Lisa,oh my god!
48827,Lisa,working? where?
48091,Lisa,but wait. how am i supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
41797,Lisa,"ah, me too!"
46019,Lisa,"dad, i'm not dead!"
42527,Lisa,"hey bart, if we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with krusty, it might get his career going again."
49078,Lisa,they sound great... i'd love to read them sometime.
52147,Lisa,"once upon a midnight dreary,"
46358,Lisa,/ wow.
51419,Lisa,"i don't need a new ralph, i like the old one. happy valentine's day!"
41768,Lisa,"bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before i join them i have one question: today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and i'm afraid to ask."
52169,Lisa,whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
47642,Lisa,it's not fair!
46940,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. this first time we'll only take a few steps outside."
48609,Lisa,"...hitachee tribe.,hitachee tribe,2
111238,390,17,lisa simpson: wait"
46300,Lisa,"we've been spinning for hours! i've got to get to my school and hand in linguo. oh, but i don't want to leave you."
44320,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad."
44592,Lisa,sure we do. ding ding ding ding ding.
45586,Lisa,funzo? i said that name in class.
45823,Lisa,why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
50191,Lisa,"because, it's too elitist. everyone's parents are in ""the business."""
45506,Lisa,he's getting closer!
41836,Lisa,"no one wants your stupid police badge, bart."
48406,Lisa,all i'm saying is--
43893,Lisa,aye carumba!
47201,Lisa,just for that?
45722,Lisa,bite me.
52466,Lisa,"and furthermore,"
45835,Lisa,"too hot to bicker, i reckon."
43163,Lisa,"bart, you can't actually call these places! don't you know how expensive international calls are?"
42432,Lisa,but this project has no scientific merit.
50707,Lisa,by who? lenny?
44541,Lisa,"nothing is going to happen, mom. i hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
49950,Lisa,...and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers.
47102,Lisa,this awful. it's like listening to schubert's unfinished symphony!
48466,Lisa,i never wanted that to happen!
42721,Lisa,excuse me. miss lovell? i'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy.
41656,Lisa,"geez, why is lisa so mad at me? i only came to this dump so i could be with her. and, what happened to my big sandwich?"
51632,Lisa,i've got an idea... but i'll need that broccoli.
43578,Lisa,can i fly it?
47654,Lisa,everyone chickened out. except ralph. he got poached by the chicago tribune.
51646,Lisa,one jumbo joe to go!
50827,Lisa,"and the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay."
42669,Lisa,"thank you. and thank you, dad. you got it back, just like you said you would."
42694,Lisa,"dad, dad!"
45198,Lisa,it's so rigid and uncreative.
50776,Lisa,that's my brother! four years out of four.
51558,Lisa,i'd love that. see you tonight!
45976,Lisa,are you all right?
44322,Lisa,"/ yahoo! / oh, man, am i glad to get outta there! / etc."
44951,Lisa,"but, dad..."
45745,Lisa,excuse me. we just came to get our balloon.
48966,Lisa,"bart, i have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. put its fingerprints all over the railing..."
42193,Lisa,it's mom!
44168,Lisa,"it's hopeless. utterly, utterly hopeless."
44871,Lisa,yahhh!
45900,Lisa,"shut up all of you, or i'll sue."
43089,Lisa,that's what i assumed.
49907,Lisa,"bart, please! i'm trying to hear dr. house's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!"
50042,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
46622,Lisa,i would like to call my only witness: almighty god.
48337,Lisa,we're the band. and we're on!
51150,Lisa,"dear she-done-left-me-records. once again, i write protesting your holographic exploitation of blues icon bleeding gums murphy. i call for a boycott and girl-cott of your entire catalogue until you... sonny rollins?!"
45380,Lisa,"oh, this is so embarrassing."
44451,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
48620,Lisa,centered. centered. you know where the four states come together?
47596,Lisa,"dad, i think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to."
48442,Lisa,michael?
48865,Lisa,"i really identified with the girls in ""ghost world."" they made me feel like i wasn't so alone."
49595,Lisa,yes. but they're my own original creation.
44838,Lisa,"bart, did you glue those on?"
51292,Lisa,"'cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do / one is the loneliest number, worse than two... and one-- you know, i really think i've made the point."
46689,Lisa,"congratulations, dad. the first step is admitting it."
42919,Lisa,it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine's day...
45325,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. hurry, everyone! we don't have much time!"
49388,Lisa,so you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
48581,Lisa,maybe you should be ashamed of yourself!
42171,Lisa,"i feel like i'm gonna die, bart."
46859,Lisa,"mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?"
47900,Lisa,"look, dad wrote something: ""dino -- short for dinosaur? remember to ask jeeves."""
46252,Lisa,i don't care. i hate them.
46312,Lisa,look out!
51777,Lisa,dad no! elon musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!
44659,Lisa,"oh, figs."
46502,Lisa,and we carried it out as a family!
42958,Lisa,i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
49797,Lisa,old ad for buzz cola...
52113,Lisa,dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
45991,Lisa,"you're welcome to come, too."
52337,Lisa,marco!
50044,Lisa,so i want to honor grampa by giving my inheritance to charity. but which one?
50856,Lisa,"guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!"
44311,Lisa,"oh, dear god!"
45719,Lisa,the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it!
43422,Lisa,"mom, you fuss over us way too much."
52249,Lisa,"please, before you do anything, there's someone i'd like you to talk to."
46652,Lisa,"mom, these are slums. the government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended."
43392,Lisa,could not!
43673,Lisa,"uh, no."
42416,Lisa,"oh bart, i forgot my math book. would you hold this for me, please?"
44506,Lisa,"c'mon, c'mon! a bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! she suddenly uncovers a white patch."
43084,Lisa,"i don't know. maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark."
49010,Lisa,"look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. but they're for losers!"
44044,Lisa,i thought you weren't there.
43663,Lisa,what about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?
45278,Lisa,my tummy really hurts.
48260,Lisa,"i'll stay with you, dad."
51243,Lisa,"'cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins!"
48625,Lisa,the people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land.
46720,Lisa,"uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us."
48488,Lisa,"dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!"
45800,Lisa,"mr. gumbel, you're upsetting me."
43425,Lisa,ow! mah tug!
43892,Lisa,"don't have a cow, man!"
46261,Lisa,"no, dr. bushwell is a woman."
49310,Lisa,"go, live your lives, get off my face!"
48997,Lisa,"mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream! martha graham danced well into her seventies."
49920,Lisa,it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
47812,Lisa,"he's just being true to the bible, which is pretty violent."
50058,Lisa,but don't you know that people who don't go to college make three percent less than people who do?
42122,Lisa,"what a beautiful story, sideshow bob. you're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
49067,Lisa,"for you, dad -- i consider that a victory."
42682,Lisa,if anyone wants me i'll be in my room.
49145,Lisa,my job: making you look good.
43077,Lisa,"there's you, dad!"
43523,Lisa,"it's no use, bart. we can't stay up forever."
51568,Lisa,hooray.
44137,Lisa,"um, excuse me, sir. the thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. but after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
52498,Lisa,but doctor... he's so much more interesting this way.
47030,Lisa,now she's dating mr. flanders. that's so romantic!
47933,Lisa,he was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week. that's not gonna happen!
52469,Lisa,"oh, you poor thing -- this is a tough time of year for someone who's allergic to holly, mistletoe, the red part of candy canes..."
42132,Lisa,i gotta help him.
49870,Lisa,schnell! schnell!
45453,Lisa,"oh sorry, dad, we didn't know."
43087,Lisa,no! no! no! no!!!
49730,Lisa,larry? larry? larry? larryyyy?!
49098,Lisa,i'm lisa simpson. and this is my family.
48686,Lisa,it's seven a.m.
52196,Lisa,"but bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?"
51662,Lisa,oh no! you're not leaving me to clean this up!
52341,Lisa,"i want to go on a pony ride, unky herb."
52243,Lisa,"i'll be playing my first solo. if you miss it on saturday, i'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on sunday."
42415,Lisa,the very same. i think this tomato could wipe out world hunger.
43251,Lisa,"hey, dad. did you forget to give those cufflinks to hugh?"
50345,Lisa,no one sent me. i just knocked on the door and it opened!
52158,Lisa,"hmmm. well as long as i'm asking something, can i ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?"
49312,Lisa,you'll always have bart. always.
41883,Lisa,peace on earth.
42766,Lisa,"yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels."
52123,Lisa,it looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
49603,Lisa,"well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine."
44274,Lisa,let's all walk laddie.
48866,Lisa,mm-hm.
45529,Lisa,"the national weather service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling."
51591,Lisa,answer me!
48088,Lisa,not scared... not scared...
48721,Lisa,are you sure?
51339,Lisa,by discussing the school's budget crisis?
42504,Lisa,now wait a minute. how can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you?
49367,Lisa,"well, you can't keep juliet and me apart! i'll... i'll disobey!"
50260,Lisa,"aw, poor baby."
50999,Lisa,there is nothing like your biological family.
49728,Lisa,larry!
43210,Lisa,that's the book i need. you'll probably take forever with it too.
51211,Lisa,when what's all over?!
43003,Lisa,"dad, look!"
46078,Lisa,"nice work, everybody!"
48994,Lisa,really? how?
42655,Lisa,"wake up, dad! wake up! there was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
45667,Lisa,"no, he isn't. i don't know where he is."
46481,Lisa,awww...
47544,Lisa,and thanks for showing my brother that girls can be cool.
50526,Lisa,goorsha!
47724,Lisa,i'd like that.
48831,Lisa,just dance.
50795,Lisa,"please, i've had enough attention for one day!"
49031,Lisa,and i used rhetoric in my answer!
49531,Lisa,i'm going to dizzyland!
51844,Lisa,"well i wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father i have. therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts."
42351,Lisa,aaaahhhh!!!
47310,Lisa,daisies.
45031,Lisa,i see an eye!
50939,Lisa,"i bought you a ticket for the mypad raffle, dad."
45184,Lisa,great. this is all gold.
46105,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
45222,Lisa,"there's an opening, mom!"
51377,Lisa,all that's left is bart.
49364,Lisa,"mom, stop! this is our thing, not yours!"
50505,Lisa,that's pathetic.
48943,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna get it!"
42751,Lisa,we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board.
44405,Lisa,"...so in 1966, a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam, where he rose to become platoon sergeant. ralph?"
48558,Lisa,"dad, you can read to me anytime."
46681,Lisa,"bart, this is just dad!"
50005,Lisa,arts arts arts education...
50883,Lisa,more importantly it's a college fund...
51800,Lisa,"uh, i'll make brownies later."
50512,Lisa,"uh-oh, i'm losing the crowd!"
52331,Lisa,we didn't say anything.
46520,Lisa,francis of assisi .
42244,Lisa,"possibly. but the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. and i do."
42828,Lisa,no.
48307,Lisa,"yeah, the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks."
51548,Lisa,"um, why don't i just go sit alone and-- oh, you're doing it."
44056,Lisa,"here we are, chapter two: ""so your pressure is dropping."" --"
45010,Lisa,lazy father...
45797,Lisa,"there you are. come on, we have to go. dad pushed a waitress. and mom lost twenty thousand dollars."
50026,Lisa,how do you cope?
50361,Lisa,ew.
46248,Lisa,"wait, rhinos don't come from eggs."
46730,Lisa,i guess we won't be biking through italy.
41812,Lisa,"uh, maybe i should be going. i caught you at a bad time."
44467,Lisa,"yes i am! come on, spotty!"
49672,Lisa,spell? those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they?
47281,Lisa,"oh, this place is paradise."
50635,Lisa,i'd have more friends if i knew what people liked. but i won't know what people like unless i'm their friend. it's a conundrum.
51087,Lisa,grampa's story was true?
48617,Lisa,"show's over, let's go!"
41813,Lisa,the truth must be told.
50881,Lisa,you put my college fund on a poker site?!
49004,Lisa,"cigarettes?! they could kill you. they did a whole episode about it on ""the suite life of zach and cody""! zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. but she went for cody instead! zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
49385,Lisa,cu-ckoo!
51279,Lisa,"we're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back! all the way to a new con-tract! 'cause union power is a fact! and we're..."
50843,Lisa,i was thinking amateurs only.
49380,Lisa,and so the queens--
46961,Lisa,"mom, why did you wake me up? i dreamt i was at the kennedy center honors."
43366,Lisa,"mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
51858,Lisa,"yeah, bart. you're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
44143,Lisa,we should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.
46343,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
50030,Lisa,"maggie, your big sister is leaving for a more artistic life. i'll send for you when i'm famous. we'll take the town by storm like the brontë sisters."
48322,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
43600,Lisa,"i will do it, bartron. who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed?"
46247,Lisa,mom! bart implied i was a warthog!
44263,Lisa,"oh, foreign language institute. oh, my german verb wheel!"
48486,Lisa,"dad, here's a thought: if you just gave mom credit, maybe she could help you."
50549,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
43506,Lisa,"hi, dad. looking for me?"
42930,Lisa,"no, thanks."
45464,Lisa,ewww. mom!
42594,Lisa,"the only way to get bart back is to kill the head vampire, mr. burns."
49990,Lisa,"and when you wag your tail, it really lights up a room."
49137,Lisa,to make bart a krusketeer?
50035,Lisa,are you saying arts camp was a lie?
45366,Lisa,what the heck's going on?
43820,Lisa,"mom, you're the greatest. can i have this licorice?"
47690,Lisa,"oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
48216,Lisa,"grampa, stop."
46913,Lisa,"dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. it's too late."
47018,Lisa,"intransigence. ""i..."""
47978,Lisa,"i really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, dad."
48188,Lisa,"and literature is filled with tales of redemption, from jean valjean to the voice of buzz lightyear, tim allen."
47196,Lisa,i guess so.
43908,Lisa,"did you hear that, bart?"
51152,Lisa,"you're a hologram, aren't you?"
46753,Lisa,"dad, no. we're trying to conserve energy."
43726,Lisa,will do.
48132,Lisa,"you didn't like it, did you?"
48557,Lisa,is that really how it ends? what happened to the merlinical council?
45030,Lisa,"that never happened, dad."
42830,Lisa,"i'm really glad you're back, dad. i knew you could do it. now don't screw it up."
50595,Lisa,"mo-om, what are you doing?"
51961,Lisa,"no, that's okay, dad. i'll just work on my fingering. unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you."
48564,Lisa,"oh, you poor man. fired on christmas eve!"
46097,Lisa,i always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
50090,Lisa,"okay, bottom line: i need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers."
49934,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! ew! ew!
42065,Lisa,to the game.
44118,Lisa,you know her?
42116,Lisa,i guess that executive stress ball we got him for christmas isn't working.
49536,Lisa,"dad, no!"
44501,Lisa,"mr. hutz, we won."
45850,Lisa,"what am i doing wrong, little vicki?"
41889,Lisa,i had a bad dream. could i sleep in your bed?
46275,Lisa,"dad, no!"
48988,Lisa,"all is lost... angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six... magic, magic, magic... all is won!"
51830,Lisa,i can't believe you're gambling.
50117,Lisa,"look, dad! ""players and coaches' entrance!"""
49842,Lisa,hi. now what are you up to?
47515,Lisa,and it would be nice to have someone here i can beat up.
47057,Lisa,"dad, this just isn't working."
52385,Lisa,do not feed animals. do not allow animals in the car. do not make eye contact with animals.
49130,Lisa,i found them on her nightstand.
51953,Lisa,so typical of bart. all he thinks about is himself.
44212,Lisa,"well, he's not here! nobody's here! and none of you should be here! you've all been tricked!"
45747,Lisa,i don't know if i'll be able to accept moe as dr. tad winslow.
44098,Lisa,"i'll see what else is on. hey, where's the remote?"
47672,Lisa,"mr. flanders, why are you moving?"
52308,Lisa,no.
47236,Lisa,i can't believe nelson is more popular than me.
43781,Lisa,"i knew it! i knew it because why would they have our national grammar rodeo in another nation?! oh, bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
41691,Lisa,"the train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
49922,Lisa,"you know, when i'm sad, i read something beautiful and true: poetry."
48826,Lisa,dad? where are you?
48779,Lisa,"bart's makin' faces, dad."
47592,Lisa,"well, i know one thing you could do..."
43786,Lisa,"langdon alger? oh, i don't like him anymore... okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially bart."
49050,Lisa,"all right, so i put that there to get you to stop eating meat. but your body is going to miss the protein. so you'll have to take these pills."
43400,Lisa,"mr. burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner moe szyslak. his bar was closed because of burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur barney gumble. when moe's closed, barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the love tester machine."
50779,Lisa,you said they'd take it easy on me!
47155,Lisa,"see, now that's the kind of dog you should be."
48621,Lisa,not there. not even close.
46718,Lisa,"well, bart's kinda-- no!"
49556,Lisa,not if you use a dimmer switch.
42115,Lisa,just tell me when the scary part's over.
50876,Lisa,i guess.
52132,Lisa,"that wasn't scary at all, bart."
48427,Lisa,"otto, help me!"
51070,Lisa,but why would my teacher be a bully?
46585,Lisa,texas.
41802,Lisa,i'm too excited to sleep. anyone up for the winifred beecher howe memorial?
47308,Lisa,i picked mom a bouquet of erigeron
43431,Lisa,"well, when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention?"
48622,Lisa,we were south... west of... north dakota-lahoma.
49816,Lisa,i'll never know if eliza got virgil safely to freedom!
49062,Lisa,what's going on?
44018,Lisa,"""nuke the whales?"" you don't really believe that, do you?"
45289,Lisa,how am i supposed to hallucinate with all these swirling colors distracting me?
43236,Lisa,"oh hugh, thank you. you've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal."
46522,Lisa,"here, have one of my fudge-stuffed toaster pies."
42436,Lisa,mmmm.
46429,Lisa,we're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my dad's childhood.
51079,Lisa,can you sign my yearbook?!
41849,Lisa,"i will, mr. gumbel. but if you'll excuse me, i'm profiling my dad for the school paper. i thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
47252,Lisa,we need to get teachers more involved! have them meet with struggling kids in the morning before school.
50647,Lisa,"wait a minute, grownups are on this?"
45789,Lisa,i have a lot of meetings. i'm the president.
45936,Lisa,"oh, snorky..."
41612,Lisa,"howdy pardners, my name is sheriff..."
48306,Lisa,i know who donald trump is.
44229,Lisa,"bart? did you stop because i said to? if so, thank you."
41744,Lisa,lee-mur. lee-mur.
50796,Lisa,oh god.
45012,Lisa,you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
50061,Lisa,isn't that a christmas tie?
47595,Lisa,"no, pie man! don't do it!"
48577,Lisa,after brazil.
47480,Lisa,no. that's wrong.
52141,Lisa,wait a minute!
42239,Lisa,stop this float!
49447,Lisa,where's maggie?
49173,Lisa,here's an imaginary cell phone.
44362,Lisa,"oh, grampa, you're not busy are you?"
42649,Lisa,does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
46974,Lisa,ow! indian burn!
41996,Lisa,"look at the fear in his eyes. listen to the quiver in his voice. he's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
47605,Lisa,"uh, i think we'll go to bed now."
50107,Lisa,"well, there's a ninety-seven percent chance i'm not, so do what i say."
45626,Lisa,"no they won't. we'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? guys...?"
51980,Lisa,"no, sir."
52427,Lisa,"-- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. i think they're called the eye teeth."
44730,Lisa,"uh, i am! i'm strongly opposed to... proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
48381,Lisa,uh... uh...
47245,Lisa,to fight for kid-power / i must be heard not seen / i have to lead wisely / not just primp and preen!
42370,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
49775,Lisa,i must have him!
46460,Lisa,no.
51602,Lisa,the last day of school. field day. when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
45821,Lisa,what? / how could you?
52127,Lisa,that's okay.
51113,Lisa,milhouse? got anything good?
45479,Lisa,"dad, that's an ambulance."
42993,Lisa,"because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius springfield has ever known -- birchibald t. barlow!"
49554,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. these girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. i hope you understand."
44940,Lisa,"guys, this is alex."
50590,Lisa,don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
46285,Lisa,"uh-oh, the bus!"
47852,Lisa,whatever!
50302,Lisa,"that doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. i wonder where he'll go."
44616,Lisa,"watch yourself, dad. you're the highly suggestible type."
43421,Lisa,"wow, mom. you didn't have to go to this much trouble."
45133,Lisa,chalmers.
50132,Lisa,you're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.
44062,Lisa,"mo-om, let's just grab what we can and get out of here. this storm is making people crazy."
44289,Lisa,"i normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: ha! it couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
42857,Lisa,it's my room and i can do what i want.
47786,Lisa,dad?...
48978,Lisa,where is this music coming from?
48439,Lisa,where did you get that?
50655,Lisa,"i know it's awful and insular, and caused thirty-five deaths, but i had friends! four digits of friends! i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell!"
42750,Lisa,that's the spirit.
50981,Lisa,"spinach farm, huh? that's right, you talk in your sleep."
44853,Lisa,"hi, larry."
42364,Lisa,excuse me.
41902,Lisa,"i called her. she's not home. i also tried mr. flanders, aunt patty, aunt selma, dr. hibbert, reverend lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
41950,Lisa,"is mom gonna have another baby, dad?"
44135,Lisa,me! / i would! /
46765,Lisa,"well, duh."
43469,Lisa,"oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism."
44380,Lisa,yes! you thought i couldn't but i could i did! and i could do it again let's do it again!
49613,Lisa,"mom, i came here to tell you it's not too late to back out."
45290,Lisa,"wow, my mind just created that out of nothing. this tank is releasing the full potential of my brain."
45315,Lisa,"we can't keep living like this. moses, ask pharaoh to let your people go."
43357,Lisa,"i did the best i could, bleeding gums."
44961,Lisa,"okay, girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats..."
50266,Lisa,bart?
41948,Lisa,is anything wrong?
47138,Lisa,need-help-now-come-with-me-done-something-terrible!
52124,Lisa,quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
43519,Lisa,"don't make us poke your eyes out, dad."
43625,Lisa,"c'mon, mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
50038,Lisa,mom! take me home!
43513,Lisa,"if your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them."
49013,Lisa,"lisa, mom. i'm lisa."
44701,Lisa,grampa!
46505,Lisa,"well, my room is my sanctuary. my family knows that and respects that."
45625,Lisa,have you been in here all day?
41968,Lisa,"bart simpson! the thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. when they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
42083,Lisa,"if you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
52206,Lisa,oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby.
45055,Lisa,to protect and sever?
45685,Lisa,bart did it! and they're gonna try for a field goal.
43333,Lisa,"thank you. oh dad, why did he have to die?"
43707,Lisa,the missing piece of the puzzle... i've got it!
52412,Lisa,i believe i know the answer.
43614,Lisa,this is the worst christmas ever.
49692,Lisa,you just increased the volume!
44535,Lisa,"look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
51106,Lisa,but how did you get the key?
48533,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
44733,Lisa,i'm supposed to talk to you about proposition 305...
47747,Lisa,hmmm. so... is it okay if i go to the women's conference with chloe?
42380,Lisa,"ralph, i think you're nice but, i'm just not ready for this kind of thing. do you understand?"
47976,Lisa,"i really do like working with you, dad. will you keep helping me?"
50996,Lisa,"princeton, b.a., oxford, m.a. -- i smell a rhodes."
48513,Lisa,"you know, artfully arranged, these fragments could be an epic poem -- like t.s. eliot's ""the wasteland."""
50765,Lisa,dad?
52009,Lisa,this is gonna be the best birthday breakfast mom ever had.
50734,Lisa,"i've been following your storyline from afar, bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. perhaps i could broker a settlement."
44554,Lisa,wow! / your own billboard! / check it out!
44746,Lisa,i got it! woo hoo! i mean... splendid.
50550,Lisa,can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
47748,Lisa,"i've never disobeyed mom before. is this a step i'm really willing to take? i don't know. the more i think about it, the..."
48690,Lisa,"you tell him, jesminder!"
49605,Lisa,"mom, isn't that book the bible of right-wing losers?"
51271,Lisa,american football.
51352,Lisa,"hello, isabel? listen..."
42856,Lisa,oh!
51687,Lisa,"professor farnsworth, i'm dying to know how you got here. was it a time machine?"
44036,Lisa,"see, you do have a tender side. you just needed someone to bring it out."
45847,Lisa,"but i want to learn a dance i can use in real life, like the tango de la muerte."
51909,Lisa,arrrgh!
50195,Lisa,"hm, apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent."
51206,Lisa,i think someone i love is a terrorist. does that make me crazy?
43699,Lisa,"don't forget to look in his shoes. when i lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes."
50984,Lisa,i don't like this game! nobody likes this game! even the kids on the box look bored!
48268,Lisa,c'mon!
48044,Lisa,"i get it. every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right! that's when they ask for your money."
52100,Lisa,"maggie, maggie."
50073,Lisa,can i hold your hand... for balance?
46149,Lisa,there's something weird about this video...
50355,Lisa,and george washington took a trip down the...ear-y canal!
45125,Lisa,what?
51763,Lisa,i knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
49359,Lisa,juliet? are you okay?
47518,Lisa,"he tried once, but he got confused and thought the book was real. he's still looking for that chocolate factory. it consumes him."
47953,Lisa,"well, i think this family should try more vegetarian meals. we'd feel better and live longer."
44935,Lisa,"oh, jacks. jacks are big. they went out for a while, but then they came roaring back."
44215,Lisa,"i said go to ""bed."""
49902,Lisa,dad! i found what you're looking for!
43266,Lisa,who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
43760,Lisa,i'm learning about owls.
48356,Lisa,that's right. i'm toilet.
46994,Lisa,well how often is that gonna come up?
51850,Lisa,like shine-ola!
49249,Lisa,i blew it again.
48543,Lisa,"all right, no husband."
43023,Lisa,"yeah, well i eat fruit loops for breakfast."
42638,Lisa,"excuse me, mr. mayor."
45261,Lisa,but where am i supposed to live?!
50989,Lisa,where are we going?
42920,Lisa,poor ralph.
45081,Lisa,candy warhol? xavier nougat?
45041,Lisa,you had it on the way over!
42595,Lisa,"no, dad."
46127,Lisa,"dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. you remember the story of oedipus, don't you?"
41845,Lisa,a role model in my very own home. how convenient.
52187,Lisa,"bart, we're just gonna borrow them."
41865,Lisa,"oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on monday at school."
49227,Lisa,"cocoa! ""ice rink drink!"""
52028,Lisa,"yes, you are."
51730,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
47793,Lisa,how many men do you know?
44530,Lisa,"you? but... you're an intelligent person, mom."
48817,Lisa,shout!
43142,Lisa,"daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
47125,Lisa,"thanks for making me feel better about this place, luke."
45736,Lisa,ewwww.
51228,Lisa,the fat in the hat!
48976,Lisa,i thought i turned that tape off.
52306,Lisa,"well, at sunday school we learned that stealing is a sin."
48984,Lisa,i learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.
43215,Lisa,he can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
48945,Lisa,oh my god!
42502,Lisa,"mr. white, can we borrow you for a minute?"
43499,Lisa,"wow, paul mccartney! i read about you in history class. but where's your wife, linda?"
45824,Lisa,"some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
49164,Lisa,stop it! both of you! you have a common land! a literature! and the sweetest songs on earth! toora loora loora -- toora loora lie / hush my little baby / hush now don't you cry
45050,Lisa,"ohh, bart, that's plutonium. it's highly unstable."
50805,Lisa,"well, i denounce thee!"
49653,Lisa,"dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
44414,Lisa,i said no!
49727,Lisa,afro-cuban?
48873,Lisa,oh no we won't!
48647,Lisa,your minds are opening! take it home!
42212,Lisa,so you think i'm ugly?
47326,Lisa,"i don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time."
41748,Lisa,"you know his blood type, how romantic."
48682,Lisa,"okay, this is the place."
50605,Lisa,they self-reference each other.
44441,Lisa,"good one, dad."
51669,Lisa,"stopping mr. burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""beezus and ramona."" but i know someone who can help..."
42530,Lisa,krusty! what have you done to yourself?
49001,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i got confused."
50483,Lisa,"dad, i'm going to entertain you with the help of ""the brothers karamazov."" ""alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which i shall describe in its proper place."""
46230,Lisa,"the bully has caught my scent, and she's at maximum rage. professor frink?"
49181,Lisa,i know! it's a complete violation of your rights. not to mention--
50127,Lisa,"no. but you did do something. you made me love baseball. not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
49520,Lisa,"when you say it, it's not just in your head."
49678,Lisa,"um, it's the wiccan home page."
51625,Lisa,oh no.
43337,Lisa,how come?
47490,Lisa,i miss them all so much.
45682,Lisa,do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
46909,Lisa,"i don't like mcnuggets, i'm a vegetarian!"
45857,Lisa,why?
44165,Lisa,then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
49264,Lisa,a couple hours? i can do the sunday puzzle in less than one hour!
43595,Lisa,"i will, mom."
42290,Lisa,look! there we are!
49402,Lisa,"aha! so dad's life would actually have been worse, because he wouldn't have gotten together with mom, his one true love!"
52528,Lisa,"as i told you when we talked last month, i've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead."
41712,Lisa,you're so silly.
49817,Lisa,to the reference desk!
50744,Lisa,two!?!!!
45333,Lisa,"where are you going with that junk, dad?"
46915,Lisa,so you know one thing about me. big deal.
45912,Lisa,"oh, that's it!"
50591,Lisa,"we did it, bart! i'm a mentor!"
43762,Lisa,security guards?
43702,Lisa,i-i-i...
51739,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
52214,Lisa,"it's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great... see, there's georgia o'keefe... susan b. anthony... and this is marjorie stoneman douglas. i'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades."
51305,Lisa,oh my god. someone wants to be my partner. can't screw this up.
46955,Lisa,"dad, i think this might be the work of satan."
42341,Lisa,goodbye dad! don't eat any solids.
45249,Lisa,"yeah, but corporate sponsorship cheapens our nation's treasures."
47823,Lisa,why did you burn up your shirt?
41938,Lisa,the wax never lies.
51966,Lisa,yeah.
49394,Lisa,homer simpson...
43324,Lisa,"wow, you've had some career. although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
52263,Lisa,and janey and i went bird watching. we saw a grackle.
51394,Lisa,"it's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like ""worms with friends."""
44125,Lisa,shh. tv.
46303,Lisa,my dad's not here? i need a ride to school.
51043,Lisa,why are you so mean to me?
46571,Lisa,"dad, no. it says ""don't walk""!"
47084,Lisa,"named after its discoverer, professor artemis deadly, who was ironically killed in the shower of 1853."
43828,Lisa,"no, i mean american indians."
47591,Lisa,"i want you to stop this, dad. before you get killed."
50911,Lisa,sure. i have the ending for my memoir!
51208,Lisa,how much did you hear?
46246,Lisa,"hey, you didn't see a warthog!"
45760,Lisa,"hey, where's maggie?"
42072,Lisa,homemaker?!
47871,Lisa,i've realized how much i missed you -- and i can see from this magnificent lisa statue that you felt the same way.
43076,Lisa,see?
48661,Lisa,"hey, mr. flanders, what'd you get?"
48524,Lisa,but how can you--
43390,Lisa,could not!
44079,Lisa,"santa's little helper, it's your birthday? we've got to get you a present! yes we do! yes we do!"
49176,Lisa,"dad, do laundry."
46190,Lisa,"you like malibu stacey, too?"
45173,Lisa,"what a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon..."
42462,Lisa,it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots.
50872,Lisa,"i think it's ""new car smell."""
42030,Lisa,"bart, who's winning?"
45098,Lisa,"we'll see about that, mate."
47696,Lisa,"mom, if i don't have you to look up to, i don't have anyone."
49851,Lisa,"life stinks, huh?"
49395,Lisa,vance connor...
50632,Lisa,what the--
44278,Lisa,"oh, it's for my junior achievers club. we're trying to earn money by recycling."
49044,Lisa,awww.
45280,Lisa,i'm really not the chuckling type.
52409,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
43121,Lisa,or an inlet.
49261,Lisa,"hey, bouvier was jackie kennedy's maiden name."
52493,Lisa,too much sodium.
51505,Lisa,what you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
41781,Lisa,not very well.
45427,Lisa,"this is ""wired."" it's about computers and technology."
50141,Lisa,"bite me now, edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
47819,Lisa,"rappers stopped saying ""illin'"" twelve years ago."
42977,Lisa,i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
45399,Lisa,aren't those supposed to be confidential?
46128,Lisa,oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
43799,Lisa,my scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
49549,Lisa,"dad, i don't want to hurt people's feelings."
47496,Lisa,i'm sorry i ran off. being second to maggie's not so bad. but why didn't maggie press the right button 'til i told her to?
51092,Lisa,no further questions.
51337,Lisa,you're just taking advantage of the situation.
43316,Lisa,ew. how'd you get a name like that?
42990,Lisa,"all right, bob! now it's personal!!"
46029,Lisa,not yet.
44852,Lisa,that's one small step f-- whoa!
42509,Lisa,o.j.
49449,Lisa,"no, i was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
52445,Lisa,he ruined the one chance i had of getting to know mr. bergstrom outside of school.
49042,Lisa,"keep it down, i'm reading ""harry potter!"""
47713,Lisa,"sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six..."
50729,Lisa,"dad, they can only go three miles an hour!"
49040,Lisa,southern-fried succubus?
45946,Lisa,"stoats are weasels, bart. they don't come in cans."
52192,Lisa,"well, it's very frustrating."
44507,Lisa,everybody! come quick!
48195,Lisa,i feel so sick.
46670,Lisa,"that's true, bart. our father knows the best way to embarrass his kids."
50250,Lisa,"du grunst nicht nur zur sommerzeit, /"
47522,Lisa,where's your costume?
42227,Lisa,but those other girls are prettier than me.
41851,Lisa,"he's just a little nervous. he has to give a speech tomorrow on ""how to keep cool in a crisis."""
46711,Lisa,campus?
43491,Lisa,the whole world wants me to eat meat. i can't fight it anymore.
42596,Lisa,you must drive this stake right through his heart.
51108,Lisa,today you were truly a hero. thank you.
50176,Lisa,"mom, dad! please, can i go here? i'll study so hard i'll make the old me look like bart."
44022,Lisa,i wish i could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.
51434,Lisa,ew.
47228,Lisa,"hey, as long as we're thinking about her, grandma's still alive."
42098,Lisa,"bart, why'd you take the blame?"
49020,Lisa,is it bart?
48968,Lisa,i can't live with the guilt. i'm going to martin's house... to end it all!
46254,Lisa,look what mbali gave me.
46298,Lisa,just like me!
51138,Lisa,well then you shouldn't feel bad because i can't imagine myself ever getting married.
47364,Lisa,you don't even know what the idea is.
48760,Lisa,"principal skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."
46903,Lisa,just buy me the friggin' toy.
44366,Lisa,okay. i'm not gonna give up. solitude never hurt anyone. emily dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! and went crazy as a loon.
45108,Lisa,"brown, brown, brown..."
42679,Lisa,like what?
49971,Lisa,we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés. not all blondes are dumb! not all fat people are jolly.
48501,Lisa,fur is murder! when's the krusty movie coming out?
42722,Lisa,am i the first?
43064,Lisa,"no,me!takeme!me!me!me!"
50778,Lisa,um... thank you for noticing me?
51189,Lisa,that's not right.
47817,Lisa,i think he swallowed the remote.
41969,Lisa,the police will catch you sooner or later.
44621,Lisa,grades?
48350,Lisa,"okay, boys' school -- i need a challenge!"
43923,Lisa,ow! stupid bart!
51799,Lisa,"bart, i need your help to write a new anthem for springfield. will you team up with me?"
46311,Lisa,"first place, here i come. look out!"
44653,Lisa,the law has spoken.
49172,Lisa,because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
41945,Lisa,"no. because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
50362,Lisa,no!
42953,Lisa,ow!
48134,Lisa,i'm not a baby! a baby is zero to two.
46875,Lisa,"dad, we have to find a place soon. i really have to go to the bathroom and i'm out of tokens."
50561,Lisa,i've got it! a mermaid falls in love with a boy on land... i'm a genius!
44676,Lisa,"ow! bart, that has nuts in it!"
43883,Lisa,me? unlikely. my goony brother's always going to libraries. i usually hang out in front.
51593,Lisa,i'm gonna tell every psychiatrist i ever go to what you did.
47661,Lisa,you're not mad about principal skinrash?
49883,Lisa,such an intricate formicarium! i'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
42111,Lisa,you already petted him for ten minutes.
45657,Lisa,you mean like when you hid inside the conga drum to scare ricky?
44006,Lisa,"would you do me a favor? when you get back to class, just give him this note."
50376,Lisa,"raymondo, i am so sorry. i got rolled by a pro! do you know what it's like to be the kind of girl that boys never talk to and then suddenly a boy talks to you--"
50803,Lisa,why do you keep telling me what i'm gonna do? this isn't about me.
47822,Lisa,dad!? why did you do that?
51466,Lisa,how veiled?
52122,Lisa,did too.
46058,Lisa,"i'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. maybe you should quit while you're ahead."
46794,Lisa,that is so sweet.
43585,Lisa,"ow! c'mon, mom and dad are waiting!"
46598,Lisa,"mom, there's no gambling in branson. it was designed as a family destination."
47336,Lisa,"krusty, you can still have your bar mitzvah as an adult."
50542,Lisa,hey -- i know you...
50791,Lisa,"look, if i could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, i think i might have a chance to..."
48877,Lisa,we're going to a rest'rant grand op'ning / we're going to a rest'rant grand op'ning...
46647,Lisa,"look, it's the giant statue of christ on corcovado."
47109,Lisa,dad!
51367,Lisa,i mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. even spongebob did it.
45911,Lisa,"folks, we're just having a little family tiff. if you'll just bear with us..."
41798,Lisa,barbara bush.
45475,Lisa,"dad, that junkie is your son!"
42456,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
45053,Lisa,hey... gim... ah... ah!
45203,Lisa,"but it clearly says ""feet included."" they have to be here."
50807,Lisa,i denounce thee! i denounce thee! i denounce thee!
49459,Lisa,i fell in love with you / heart and soul...
44609,Lisa,they're squatting in our house?
50909,Lisa,"c'mon, tell me!"
48163,Lisa,"oh, hey milhouse. i think bart's upstairs."
48402,Lisa,creationism? but that's not science.
45273,Lisa,i just want to study.
41653,Lisa,"and i'm at a stupid, boring ballet."
47153,Lisa,you said his name two seconds ago.
45341,Lisa,"no, dad, no. my point is you have to do something big and daring."
48153,Lisa,you don't have a tail anymore.
51403,Lisa,dad! dad! you're back! you're back!
52184,Lisa,"hey, gang. okay, bart, this is the card catalog."
50730,Lisa,with great difficulty!
43227,Lisa,"mom, remember when i was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep dad from ruining it?"
42560,Lisa,"oh, those baby ducks were so cute. i can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
44818,Lisa,"uh, what a terrible waste!"
47398,Lisa,what if they parody it on mad tv?
48380,Lisa,"uh, give me your lunch money."
52199,Lisa,dad!
45054,Lisa,how humiliating.
42306,Lisa,mondale to hart: where's the beef?
43767,Lisa,"zagnut bar, mr. smithers? razzles? skittles? whatchamacallit? twizzlers?"
43568,Lisa,"all right, then we'll call your husband: grampa."
45029,Lisa,"no, no. i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse."
49500,Lisa,this broadcast is from 1979.
46862,Lisa,be careful a-- uh-oh.
42396,Lisa,"no, thanks."
44675,Lisa,"i love you, mom!"
51754,Lisa,it's called a knot.
47940,Lisa,that seems... feasible.
50152,Lisa,"maggie, something happened to mom and i'm gonna find out what and when."
48855,Lisa,that's so poetic.
41722,Lisa,"grampa, what a question?"
41731,Lisa,"hurry, mom! if we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
46348,Lisa,"uhhh, could we hear another tall tale?"
43507,Lisa,"actually dad, this time i was wrong..."
51201,Lisa,to the east! the middle east! mecca!
48815,Lisa,no.
41739,Lisa,"she means you should get a job, stupid."
42376,Lisa,ralph thinks i like him. but i only gave him a valentine 'cause i felt sorry for him.
44588,Lisa,"because he was singing, we overheard his plan / and could save those dogs from that mean old man."
44499,Lisa,"my attorney, lionel hutz, calls your attention to municipal code 147-c: ""protection of antiquities and fossils."""
52086,Lisa,"mom, you look so glamorous."
46664,Lisa,"dad, it's one a.m. and i'm out of saliva."
42567,Lisa,"actually, mom, a tweaking of mr. burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart."
51907,Lisa,arrrgh!
44596,Lisa,bring it in here.
42050,Lisa,is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
47910,Lisa,"okay, she's fat."
43758,Lisa,it's not fair! i'm the best student in school. how come i never heard about this competition?
48398,Lisa,"dad, we don't want you to leave!"
42982,Lisa,hey!
50340,Lisa,roger.
50085,Lisa,anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
50961,Lisa,wait. how could you know what herman said? you were driving away.
49213,Lisa,ow.
49481,Lisa,does kissing milhouse count?
49814,Lisa,"listen: ""april 20th, 1860. a week ago, i had no idea what the future would bring, which, i guess, is always true of everyone all the time. anyway, last saturday night, i went to colonel burns's ball..."""

49772,Lisa,yay!
51767,Lisa,so... where is he gonna sleep?
42508,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
45275,Lisa,that's awful!
42154,Lisa,i think we owe a debt to unky herb. he took us into his home and dad destroyed him.
51439,Lisa,um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
50531,Lisa,whoa! / cool!
49801,Lisa,"""dearest diary, today i am the happiest girl in springfield--"""
46111,Lisa,"how's your back, dad?"
47086,Lisa,nooo!
41991,Lisa,"okay, dad."
41661,Lisa,"oh my god, i was wrong! and by being corrected, i learned! and no one cared about my feelings!"
42921,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
46310,Lisa,there's the school!
45454,Lisa,"well, maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, i'll just go."
46488,Lisa,now i really should be getting back to my family.
51697,Lisa,why are you wearing your hat at dinner?
52139,Lisa,don't you see what's happening here? they're fattening us up so they can eat us.
43960,Lisa,"i'm allergic to everything here. my nose is so stuffed up, i can't even taste mom's delicious boiled celery."
42375,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
44184,Lisa,"yes, he had a brother robot named rod, who was two space-years older than him."
44187,Lisa,thanks for the ride!
45830,Lisa,"dad, what do we do?!"
50454,Lisa,how much?
47276,Lisa,they've taken away our crepe paper.
49697,Lisa,"fine. get this on in two minutes, lose the attitude, and for god's sake, suck in that pooch."
47123,Lisa,"mom, why are you talking like that?"
46516,Lisa,we had a good run.
50447,Lisa,it's real. i can show you!
47351,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to out-do mr. flanders. just remember the spirit of the season."
47527,Lisa,"""dear cosmic wars fan, i'm glad you loved my film?! here's a photo of your favorite new character, jim-jam bonks. may the power be on your side, randall curtis."" he ignored our criticisms!"
47548,Lisa,he's probably in costume -- he could be any of these people!

3778,Bart,"please don't make me stay, dad! i'll do anything you say! i'll find religion! i'll be good sometimes!"
10767,Bart,fine. we'll follow her.
5666,Bart,one of which?
10240,Bart,"so wayne, how'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves?"
13094,Bart,"i've got it all figured out! you can waitress while i learn to cut meat. we'll live in a trailer, but to avoid paying for parking, i'll drive while you sleep. we'll never, ever stop!"
10771,Bart,maybe i should go on anti-psychotic meds.
5602,Bart,"this book has all the classic cons. there's ""the pigeon drop,"" ""the ear wigger,"" ""the brillstein grab..."""
4988,Bart,"check it out, dad. you can print out the headline from the day you were born."
224,Bart,lisa? it's six a.m. something's wrong! dad died!
3250,Bart,"oh, this is the worst fourth of july ever. i hate america! come on, milhouse, let's go down there."

5442,Bart,"otto, since when have you had a girlfriend?"
10550,Bart,trying to fix your broken brain.
8345,Bart,"boy, it is gonna be so cool when you're a police dog..."
2493,Bart,"hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?"
8236,Bart,read it back! read it back!
6756,Bart,"if we're both touching the watch, neither of us will be affected."
6526,Bart,"mom, i am sick of the way he treats me. he disrespects me and i'm just supposed to accept it?"
12490,Bart,ooo... granny killing me!
4015,Bart,"so prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan's, ""paint your wagon!"""
6552,Bart,"i'm-i'm bart simpson, and-- hey, are you skateboarding legend tony hawk?"

10329,Bart,dad! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g!
12209,Bart,ah... about twenty three minutes and five seconds.

12301,Bart,"well, come on. we gotta do something, man."
4513,Bart,"hey, quit it!"
6761,Bart,"oh, man. things are stuck like this forever."
12974,Bart,"sniff that other dog's butt! see, he does exactly what i tell him."
9770,Bart,wrong sport.
184,Bart,our dear friend martin was trying to steal the comic book.
10944,Bart,not bad for a movie dog.

2858,Bart,what?
7876,Bart,"also, i can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and..."

517,Bart,"game's over, grampa."
12176,Bart,skunks?
9604,Bart,just tell me what you want!
6616,Bart,"i chuck 'em at nerds, girls i like, whatever."
5646,Bart,i was gonna put buttresses in.
4774,Bart,"dad, no!"
6557,Bart,"cool guy, tony hawk."
4999,Bart,cool...
10321,Bart,when did you take that picture?
1248,Bart,"what is it, dad?"
3672,Bart,hullo?
10382,Bart,"the book prints at midnight. so if we swap in the original version , they'll print the wrong book -- our book."
5655,Bart,mau! didi mau!
9828,Bart,just when you think i'm out of ideas!
10311,Bart,"to sweeten the deal, i'll pick you first for basketball."
2098,Bart,hmmm.
790,Bart,"seymour, this is an absent slip signed by nelson's mother. and this is nelson's english homework. notice the identical elongated loops on the d's."
9393,Bart,awesome fake-out!
6544,Bart,"well here i am, on my own. and i'm gonna make it, world!"
12790,Bart,"lisa, i don't know how to explain this, but i get the same thrill out of jumping over stuff that you do from... reading."
2617,Bart,that's a crud rock. it belongs in crud town.
5452,Bart,"mom, this gravy tastes better than god's sweat."
3157,Bart,"uh, excuse me... is this the world's fair visitors center?"

8288,Bart,"actually, it's saturday."
6769,Bart,all right. it says here we can learn watch repair in eight one-hour lessons.
10090,Bart,we don't have any dope.
2736,Bart,jesus?
1776,Bart,i didn't do it.
235,Bart,"dad, maybe you should do this."
6387,Bart,thanks for driving us back to town.
6681,Bart,"okay, boy. fetch!"
7999,Bart,"i feel weird. it's like a potato chip full of shame, going down my throat sideways."
9107,Bart,"now, go hide the evidence while i walk around saying ""what happened? who would do such a thing?"""
4397,Bart,ah. no day would be completely wasted without a visit to the old joke shop.
10663,Bart,"yeah, why aren't we doing lenny's story? that thing's hilarious."
10475,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, that myth is... cracked!"
6331,Bart,"hey dad, check it out!"
1392,Bart,"here ya go, doc."
5562,Bart,"well, it all started last week in krabappel's class..."
4166,Bart,"yeah, mom says a lot of things."
10418,Bart,"krusty, my man, you finally hit it big."
7625,Bart,"well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so i can get away."
1648,Bart,wowww... that's good squishee.
10941,Bart,i miss mary.
5664,Bart,"look, i'm throwing papers."
5614,Bart,"my bar mitzvah cake! oy, i'll never be a man!"
1740,Bart,wow! a big clown hankie!
3152,Bart,yes.
4001,Bart,"i don't know about this, dad. shouldn't we give the money to charity or some...? ow!"
9718,Bart,"all right, ""walt warren,"" let's see who you really are."
4173,Bart,what are they doing with our forty-five cents?
10361,Bart,"come on, skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. you've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think."
11253,Bart,seymour! the cops are on their way!
6221,Bart,this guy's always on!
6453,Bart,attention teenage boys. take your hands off my daughter!
13100,Bart,"dad, that's my fourth grade teacher!"
2848,Bart,i wash myself with a rag on a stick.
1816,Bart,"uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, mom."
3830,Bart,"well, i don't see how me signing homer's name is any different from you using sgt. skinner's name."
2220,Bart,nooooo!
2679,Bart,could so!
12711,Bart,yeah.
12656,Bart,huh?
12902,Bart,"oh, okay."

8332,Bart,"hey, mom, can we go see dad put out the fire?"
9309,Bart,eyes it is.
5362,Bart,tasty. that calls for some tuneskis.
8003,Bart,good morn-ing.
2272,Bart,"lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. at first i thought we can talk it over like civilized people. but instead, i just ripped the head off mr. honeybunny."
6850,Bart,dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off!
1512,Bart,no talking like a grizzled 1890's prospector... consarnit!
6842,Bart,"yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day."
2207,Bart,"right there, put it right there. oh, excellent. you're incredible, jessica. your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body."
9310,Bart,"hey, lis. want some soup?"
12435,Bart,"attention, fellow children. krusty didn't rob that store. sideshow bob framed him and i got proof."
6738,Bart,i'm helping daddy!
4360,Bart,"goodbye, fine china."
9116,Bart,jenny. fifth grade girl.
4689,Bart,adults! / you run our lives like you're colonel klink.

2001,Bart,sure!
1822,Bart,i won! i won!
3550,Bart,more.
10165,Bart,all i smell here is desperation.
2047,Bart,"listen, ned flanders murdered his wife."
2458,Bart,"behold, the masked dancer is me, bart."
10698,Bart,"oh man, lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did i have to get so needy at the planetarium?"
4257,Bart,"hey, give it back!"
2709,Bart,"wow. you really got it made now, milhouse. this is living."
4396,Bart,and look! barney's not even drunk yet!
10415,Bart,"krusty, you know her?"
9263,Bart,"but mom, i'm winning! look at this! his lunch money!"
5381,Bart,"man, these old cameras are really built solid."
10190,Bart,i hear he goes to california on his vacations.
9978,Bart,"what am i doin' here, seymour? the thing i'm planning hasn't even gone off yet."
6701,Bart,"hey, i've got an idea. let's tie a string around a fly."
10465,Bart,"sure, what've you got? puppy goo-goo comin' my way?"
1164,Bart,i'm here to see my grampa.
4080,Bart,these rubes in robes haven't met the likes of bart simpson before.
7557,Bart,i know what we can ask jeeves -- why does he suck?
8527,Bart,amen.
9110,Bart,"so grampa, not like i'm anxious to go, but i've been here ten minutes, which is like seven hours in kid years..."
6925,Bart,this robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. i can't believe you've never seen him fight.
6262,Bart,"come on, angry dad. get angry! don't make me do a clip show!"
878,Bart,"i didn't know you played the guitar, otto-man!"
11217,Bart,remember you've got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.
12264,Bart,"yeah, well i'm running a little short on courage right now."
3959,Bart,good ol' bluey.
3607,Bart,"hey, houdini, why don't you saw martin in half?"
11417,Bart,"no, that's a much bigger animal."
2089,Bart,"hey, everybody, whoa, look at me. i'm over here. turn this way right now."
451,Bart,"he'll be so happy, he'll be crying in his beard."
9694,Bart,you rebel scum make me sick! this is sweet justice for how you greybacks treated our boys at andersonville!
12393,Bart,my father. what a buffoon.
5982,Bart,"thanks, bob."
11041,Bart,the only cool thing about my dad was that he hated church. and now he's turned into a fat version of flanders. no offense.
3861,Bart,eat my shorts!
2587,Bart,oh yeah? take a look at this:
8472,Bart,siamese twins who've been surgically separated?
5678,Bart,i'unno.
6540,Bart,look at it.
2787,Bart,you traded my soul for pogs?! noooo!!
7469,Bart,"play?! all plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!"
1520,Bart,"yeah, and what happened to the money you made?"
8081,Bart,"mom, i can't go -- no one else is!"
12032,Bart,backscratcher! foot licker! honor student!
998,Bart,"krusty, this camp was a nightmare. they fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
6327,Bart,lisa has a dead boyfriend!
5514,Bart,you should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
7854,Bart,"hey, you know where the bathroom is?"
7220,Bart,"check it out, i'm a business jerk!"
4119,Bart,"after careful deliberation, it's my opinion that milhouse probably did eat the food. but since there's no proof, i must find him not guilty."
6454,Bart,"grampa, quick, tell me everything you know about world war one!"
3055,Bart,and krusty's superfluous third nipple!
10457,Bart,"really? it's not that bad, is it?"
9717,Bart,shut up.
9882,Bart,"hear that, boy? you're gonna be a racing pigeon!"
12552,Bart,"huh? whoa, good morning, world!"
10799,Bart,how 'bout the disney minority program?
8531,Bart,"yeah, yeah, we've all been to england. is this going somewhere?"
6957,Bart,"i know there's a catch, but tell me more."
1899,Bart,a little to the left.
9424,Bart,"hey, slimu!"
12853,Bart,"akira, my good man, i'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel."
3017,Bart,wow. livin' large!
1607,Bart,"eh, shut your yap."
6879,Bart,you don't understand -- i can't go home! you gotta give me detention. look -- i fed the gerbil coffee!
4919,Bart,"wow, these dummies look pretty good."
7183,Bart,"don't feel bad, doc. i won't even let my mom clip my toenails."
9241,Bart,"beats me, i just gave him a banana."
9567,Bart,"dad, no! that takes us into a construction site!"
4505,Bart,"wow, you are so lucky."
6081,Bart,"one, two, three, four, i declare a thumb war."
4676,Bart,"oh, that is it. i am tired of being pushed around by grownups! it's time to fight back!"
1465,Bart,... flintstones' chewable morphine.
12342,Bart,ooh! ahh! ooh! ahh! ahh! ahh! ohh!
9093,Bart,fresh!
7296,Bart,what's happening to me? maybe i'm not a kid anymore.
732,Bart,"homer, that was a twenty."
2520,Bart,"well, at least it's safer than the old bus."
4716,Bart,thanks! it's due tomorrow.
12784,Bart,there's got to be a challenge out there worthy of me.
4757,Bart,"well, you told her, dad."
6048,Bart,"mom, we're out of ""frosting gobs."""
11197,Bart,"um... there's, there's a carumba in my eye?"
9162,Bart,"and, cue snow."
11517,Bart,big deal. i don't like girls either.
9727,Bart,great day to be alive!
6124,Bart,what flavor?
5390,Bart,i said heads up.
1332,Bart,"hey, dad. why don't you give mom her present?"
9192,Bart,"milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it."
976,Bart,"oh, dad. you're the best father a boy could ever have!"
2504,Bart,"agh, my socks!"
8570,Bart,the system works!
6298,Bart,"never fear, the sphere is here!"
7429,Bart,can't i even finish my milk?
3999,Bart,"ohhh, i don't like where this is goin'."
7148,Bart,"yeah, i agree. i mean, you are pretty annoying."
12695,Bart,"we want to call it a draw, man."
4876,Bart,"hey, stop shaking the harness."
11311,Bart,"i hate this stupid holiday! the only thing you can do is screw it up. that's it! bart, you're a genius!"
7678,Bart,mom... dad. i'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
4036,Bart,i wanna go on the yard-work simulator!
4681,Bart,constable wiggum likes to act tough. but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose?
4770,Bart,yeah.
3882,Bart,get my filthy hands off my sister!
2530,Bart,"thank you, sir."
9819,Bart,"hey, what's that weird look on all those girls' faces?"
261,Bart,hey... you.
10385,Bart,a traitor?
3400,Bart,"hell, yes."
11362,Bart,milhouse abandoned me.
10143,Bart,lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! i'm the one that got a magic set for christmas two years ago.
5069,Bart,"hm. ""thanks for letting us crash in your pad. we had a very nice time."""
8520,Bart,you want to know what i think?
1307,Bart,"someday i want to be an f-14 pilot like my hero, tom. he lent me this new weapon called a neural disrupter."
10051,Bart,thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of angry dad will be on a speakerphone today.
4541,Bart,"is the nest still warm enough, mom?"
8066,Bart,he ruined her first wordloaf!
9234,Bart,"so, did you write your dream on the index card of fate?"
6802,Bart,what they wanted you to.
7178,Bart,"you're right, this is it. they're selling us to be crash test dummies."
4151,Bart,that's one of your posters. i got all the krusty stuff.
2296,Bart,"and the dog in the coppertone ad? same deal, dad?"
5936,Bart,no! get away!
8810,Bart,"""the inverted double-struck penny, or 'kissing lincolns'..."""
596,Bart,that's because i forgot to stamp it.
8373,Bart,"lisa, they're gonna put a stink bomb in the school! i might be able to stop them, but i'll need a schematic of jimbo's house."
12756,Bart,"ah, come on..."
5731,Bart,got that right.
7489,Bart,oh! now i have to start over.
7758,Bart,check it out... i stole the sign.
1707,Bart,"hey, how's it goin'?... hey, good to see you... tell your friends. lookin' lucky... hey, what's happenin'? love the jacket."
5258,Bart,wouldn't be the first time.
12654,Bart,what a sap!
4571,Bart,"i love you too, dad."
12099,Bart,ow!
9593,Bart,this is awesome! if only real life was in 3-d.
3159,Bart,"well, we've still got a car and a wad of cash."
9245,Bart,please don't kill me.
5309,Bart,he's right. i'm a loser. there's only one way out of this mess.
12970,Bart,"see boy, it's not so hard. here, roll over... roll over... like this."
11292,Bart,"so what do you think, lis? who are the good guys here, the media companies or the internet freedom guys?"
13097,Bart,"no, mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house."
4833,Bart,how'd you get the eyes to move?
7325,Bart,"dad, the bill's only a hundred."
5651,Bart,"silence, seymour. we're in charge now. your reign of fussiness is over."
4019,Bart,eep.
10861,Bart,driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs. i've really matured.
4983,Bart,"hey, at least i got to see some cool colors."
3812,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, i'm sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, i was born without taste buds. let me demonstrate."
7662,Bart,"but now dad can come home, right?"
5423,Bart,quick. up here.
12925,Bart,is not.
10403,Bart,what?!
6167,Bart,"what happened, buck?"
10163,Bart,okay.
2891,Bart,i've got a great idea. let's play space patrol.
6539,Bart,here's something to remember me by.
663,Bart,sting!
9129,Bart,"please, guys, give me a break. can you give me the duckling without beating me up?"
1983,Bart,"ah, yes, my name is homer simpson, and i'd like to order an itchy an scratchy cel. my credit card? ah, do you accept the federal breast inspector's card? license to ogle? viza?... oh yes, of course, that's what i meant, visa. it's these new dentures."
9015,Bart,"pardon me, master, but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu?"
6275,Bart,"if you love me so much, why don't you marry me? that's a good one."
5991,Bart,like the ones found in your local yellow pages.
6103,Bart,gimme the ball! gimme the ball!
7521,Bart,"bart simpson, i'm just big-boned."
9833,Bart,normal. you?
2231,Bart,"jessica, what are you doing!"
2425,Bart,"i'm way ahead of ya, dad."
3892,Bart,"missed one, dad."
12521,Bart,no.
2900,Bart,i'd sell my soul for a formula one racing car!
6694,Bart,hey! i brought a peruvian fighting frog!
10423,Bart,why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding?
4564,Bart,"oh, man!"
8047,Bart,he was driving me crazy so i sent him on an errand.
9959,Bart,"great, great."
429,Bart,"...i always suspected that nothing in life mattered. now i know for sure. get bent, bart simpson."
1337,Bart,hey!
639,Bart,i got a job for thee. bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the simpsons porch.
3104,Bart,wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. there's an easy way to get rid of chester without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.
2349,Bart,and you've never found anything?
3529,Bart,by throwing me off a dam? isn't that a little crude for a genius like you?
5840,Bart,"hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas."
8369,Bart,"if i help you, i want full immunity for all pranks past and future, and you have to teach me a swear word i don't already know."
4515,Bart,crooked sight?
9798,Bart,mousecatch?
5394,Bart,"now, there's a picture."
1682,Bart,"well, at least ned is trying! what are you doing to help?"
1555,Bart,"dad, start diggin' some nerd holes."
11442,Bart,wha-- what are you doing in here?
12674,Bart,"lisa, we can't afford all these books."
8065,Bart,"hey lis, we learned so much scootin' around vermont. did you know that candles are made by losers?"
9480,Bart,"homeroom, eight a.m."
6184,Bart,is that her?
758,Bart,cool.
8427,Bart,"um, listen, i'm outta town next week, so..."
1404,Bart,"dad, it's all my fault! i shook up that can of beer!"
849,Bart,aunt selma has one hour to live!
6018,Bart,how 'bout methodist?
9218,Bart,oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. i can check up on the old girl. she probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.
2913,Bart,"mom! no, mom!"
2923,Bart,uh... i don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
8537,Bart,i'm not sad. i have nothing to be sad about. nothing!
10914,Bart,"hey, relax. she knows she's the apple of the corner of my eye."
4248,Bart,"uh, i'll take it from here, ralph. umm, we're just hangin', chillin'... little bit of illin'."
9453,Bart,i locked him in the torah room.
11620,Bart,mo-om! dad's imagining me as food again!
5456,Bart,kills again? she hasn't killed once!
4545,Bart,"sure they are. they came from eggs in a bird's nest. therefore, they're birds. ixo fatso."
470,Bart,nope.
13063,Bart,oh my god! it's just like dad's!
5594,Bart,"well, i showed up for all your stupid interventions."
10738,Bart,the best submission will be animated and appear on the show!

8206,Bart,"you know, for a while, i was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad."
11213,Bart,"first we reel them in, then we scare the hell out of them."
1014,Bart,"lisa, this is neither the time nor the place."
5829,Bart,help! this mosquito net's not working.
12326,Bart,will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo?
65,Bart,"hey, milhouse. big blowout at casa de simpson. the only adult is frail and old."
8178,Bart,"hm, north haverbrook. the very name conjures up romance and intrigue."
900,Bart,what could come between two bestest buddies like us?
1745,Bart,"so, anyway, can i, mom? can i take the job?"
4614,Bart,"i'm starving. mom, can we go catholic so we get communion wafers and booze?"
390,Bart,cool!
7648,Bart,i'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.
1075,Bart,now's our chance to be bad.
11598,Bart,no.
4730,Bart,"um, i don't want to alarm you, but the ice cream's startin' to go south."
11024,Bart,"oh, i'm sorry, that means i threw yours out. but i still have a couple of your mini carrots."
4478,Bart,"hey, dad, heard you swearing. mind if i join in? crap. boobs. crap."
11532,Bart,"the saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting lisa, and you hit her. and the last thing she texted, before she died, was ""i got your message."" g'night."
510,Bart,"hey, it's lunchlady doris. i wonder what she's got for us today. today's special is refried dog poop."
1775,Bart,i didn't do it!
12691,Bart,"oh, man..."
11215,Bart,and what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? the new whiffle-bats? pizza friday?
4093,Bart,"ah, uh-hum. let's see. ah. the exports of libya are numerous in amount. one thing they export is corn..."
7410,Bart,"eh, you work in the business as long as i have, you're bound to repeat yourself."
7688,Bart,"we're still going to the toy store, right? and i can pick out as many toys as i want?"
7894,Bart,"dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us."
7248,Bart,i win! p-a-r-t. par-tee!
4570,Bart,"you've got to fight the hair, dad!"
910,Bart,"yeah, but never a girl. what if i want to strut around nude?"
12559,Bart,that all men are created equal.
10916,Bart,a lot of musical talent in this house. but no one blows on a blade of grass like you.
4624,Bart,"relax, there's nothing here you didn't see when dad boycotted pants."
883,Bart,otto-man?
9127,Bart,those bullies are gonna kill me! why am i doing this?
9384,Bart,"awesome -- they made a sequel to ""sever four!"" this movie's gonna be great! full of blood and gore and torture and guts and..."
8057,Bart,"great news, ma! i agreed to join the army when i turn eighteen!"
9780,Bart,"you know, lis, i'm glad i'm not playing baseball anymore. i think i'm more interested in soccer!"
1959,Bart,"oh look, charlie brown said ""good grief."" i didn't see that comin'."
8117,Bart,i've set up a trust. it bypasses the inheritance tax.
4851,Bart,that's the prize?! a banana?
511,Bart,"hey, how come lisa gets a pony?"
2114,Bart,"do it, dad."
9990,Bart,you've been gone for three months!
8551,Bart,"because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee."
12451,Bart,"work that body, homer."
2467,Bart,"so long, suckers!"
656,Bart,"look, i'll level with you. there is no timmy o'toole. it was just a prank i was playing on everybody."
4477,Bart,"oh yeah, safety sells. especially to lame-o's."
12274,Bart,"well, i know she'll like mine. who wouldn't like a bottle of real french perfume?"
1047,Bart,great caesar's ghost! a talking krusty doll!
6901,Bart,yes!
5811,Bart,"no i don't, that's the problem."
3709,Bart,"""please, mister... "" no, let me do that again. ""please, mister... please?!"""

8795,Bart,you got nothing! you got nothing!
802,Bart,"'cause i didn't want you to wreck your life. you got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. and when you do, i'll be right there to borrow money."
215,Bart,"dad, the mailman is here."
11273,Bart,now did you check the room to make sure you haven't left anything?
4430,Bart,jewel-encrusted?
4654,Bart,all right! here comes the implosion!
3518,Bart,the haunted mine.
4739,Bart,"look, it's mom!"
11112,Bart,"thanks, mom. and that means no punishment, right?"
2497,Bart,two sets of twins and a triplet!
9996,Bart,"can i have it, dad? can i?"
6021,Bart,"but dad, my heart hurts."
5498,Bart,woo hoo! yay snorky!
8842,Bart,groundskeeper willie?
4254,Bart,"sorry, ralph."
3719,Bart,"c'mon, boy. let's blow."
8401,Bart,"finally, i'm gonna take an x-ray, so lie perfectly still for twenty minutes."
1468,Bart,mr. hutz when i grow up i want to be a lawyer just like you.
11863,Bart,"hey, everybody. look what we got!"
9989,Bart,and?
4997,Bart,but who?

10099,Bart,"quit it! knock it off! stop it! dad, this isn't funny!"
6604,Bart,"oh, okay."
8248,Bart,"yeah, that and ""stanley"" was the brand of hammer my dad used to hit me with."
10992,Bart,"you show 'em, godfrey! you're the prettiest old man in the world!"
465,Bart,then doesn't your religion command you to make up with krusty?
863,Bart,"thanks, dad. sure you're not gonna be bored?"
12107,Bart,we got a rhyming dictionary.
10167,Bart,this is our house. there's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams!
8295,Bart,jumpin' johnnycakes! those dames are cheesed.
2103,Bart,"a-a-a-a-and, now."
7993,Bart,"hey guys, great news -- i can drum again!"
11527,Bart,dad!
11306,Bart,i'll give a valentine to a loser. i'll give a valentine to a dork. i'll even give a valentine to a girl. but i won't give a valentine to a bully.
13018,Bart,oh really.
3865,Bart,"hey einstein , how much for the mood pants?"
2124,Bart,wanna get a snow cone?
6353,Bart,she's not so great! she got diarrhea when we went to carlsbad caverns!

5326,Bart,i'm gonna!
179,Bart,"yeah, sure you did."

12386,Bart,"hey, monsieur. aidez-moi! ces deux types chez qui j'habite me fait travailler jour et nuit, ils ne me donnent pas a manger, ils me fait dormir sur la terre, ils mettent d'antigel dans le vin, et ils sont donne mon chapeau rouge a l'ane."
3521,Bart,what is sideshow bob doing with --
11368,Bart,you hug the bedpost. then i hug the bedpost. that way we never hug each other.
10703,Bart,i'd better switch to the hard stuff.
5187,Bart,"okay, i'll see what i can do."
1232,Bart,"hello, lisa."
1620,Bart,"uh-oh. you're in for it now, dad."
5961,Bart,you shut up.
1203,Bart,hi yo!
12954,Bart,"hey, otto-man."
2255,Bart,of course she did. who else would have?
7581,Bart,"well, i guess they'd help me hold the dictionaries up."
7642,Bart,"so milhouse walks into the bedroom, and there's his mom and dad going..."
719,Bart,"wow, a side of dad i've never seen."
7381,Bart,gotta go!
1604,Bart,blast that infernal card! don't give that card to me.
9014,Bart,why do we have to go to the rec center? i wanna play with my friends!
12412,Bart,"yeah, al. last name, koholic."
12024,Bart,"you know, there are names for people like you."
1926,Bart,"it's weird, lis. i miss him as a friend, but i miss him even more as an enemy."
3118,Bart,"hi, chester. listen, would you pay to make more itchy and scratchy cartoons?"
5255,Bart,can it wait? i just got off work!
124,Bart,"hm... well, it's practically empty."
3821,Bart,"hey, it's dad! right on time!"
10821,Bart,"ah relax, i'm over it. why aren't you at the block party?"
10666,Bart,which one? homer or fat ass?
3457,Bart,"hey lis, look! they're adding a new character to itchy and scratchy! ""poochie the dog?"""
110,Bart,no.
5819,Bart,aw darn. looks like we'll have to stay home today.
13050,Bart,s'allright.
1903,Bart,"not likely. c'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
12473,Bart,"awww, homer."
1403,Bart,"and no matter what happens, i'll never forget the advice you gave me."
7908,Bart,you're a boy -- nothing is sweet.
522,Bart,the poor guy. where's he working?
2805,Bart,"can i have a burger, dad?"
1786,Bart,let's hurl a bricky-mart!
3585,Bart,"oh, no..."
10554,Bart,"hey dad, if this is your fantasy world, how come flanders is here?"
9135,Bart,uh... it's not an easy thing to admit.
6177,Bart,can i tag along?
8799,Bart,i am so gonna try out for that!
7073,Bart,dad?!
12990,Bart,"you know, grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet."
8173,Bart,"y'know, it'd be a real shame if someone started investigating your ""indian heritage."""
7653,Bart,we tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
3088,Bart,look at that fat oaf.
11549,Bart,"a chicken feather? why would you hand this to me? oh, you must've figured out i chickened out during the race! well who are you to judge me?!"
11310,Bart,"nothing. on tv, when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea. i thought it might work for me."
3239,Bart,i thought springfield was america's scrod-basket.
6392,Bart,cool! we should try that at school!
1866,Bart,"i just don't want to be here, dad. besides, i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on."
1946,Bart,"look, if i was under seventeen, i'd be in school, right?"
47,Bart,they're fighting in the car again.
1019,Bart,"so, homer, you saw the big cheese? what'd he look like?"
4522,Bart,uh-oh.
4126,Bart,"mmm. mm. how's your dinner, lis?"
6809,Bart,umm... there's a ladybug in your hair.
4949,Bart,i'll do it.
10943,Bart,"dad, don't be a credit hog"
8403,Bart,dad!
1634,Bart,i see.
7571,Bart,"you'll pay for this, my queen."
8370,Bart,"okay, suit yourself -- it's not like you have any major events coming up that the bullies would want to disrupt."
195,Bart,nothing. it just kind of ticks me off.
9906,Bart,wha?
8272,Bart,want to melt it with a hose?
242,Bart,"joe's crematorium. you kill 'em, we grill 'em."
4278,Bart,"come on, lisa! hurry!"
13017,Bart,"the heavy hands don't work unless you move, homer."
12423,Bart,"i don't know, but i know someone who would: krusty's best friend in the whole world, sideshow bob."
727,Bart,huh? aye carumba!
10714,Bart,"c'mon, dad. you love new york. now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: old penn station and shea stadium."
4317,Bart,"the shirts continued their domination over the skins today. and in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between kearney and mr. largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. lisa?"
11020,Bart,"pass the gravy, gloria allwrong."
4653,Bart,"aren't you scared, dad? i mean, if i were fat tony, and god willing someday i will be, i'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder."
12961,Bart,"is my dog dead, ma'am?"
8624,Bart,what are you doing here?
9505,Bart,"really? not even this first-ever pin from the twenty-fourteen winter olympics in sochi, russia?"
7063,Bart,"juvie?! please judge, you can't... i-i'll do anything! i'll squeal on my dad -- he's been up to bad things. crap you've never even thought of."
10139,Bart,"i'll assume that means ""yes."""
5895,Bart,no. we've gotta show the world what dad's really like. then everything will be back to normal.
4159,Bart,eat your vegetables. take a sweater. i don't think that's a good idea.
12923,Bart,principal skinner is going to ask aunt patty to marry him.
644,Bart,"help me, please! i fell down the well!"
10079,Bart,cool! are they robots?
2058,Bart,nooooo!
6508,Bart,"fine, i'll go back to being bored."
6591,Bart,"hey, krusty should run for congress. he could help us with the airplanes!"
9888,Bart,i hope you learned something here.
7502,Bart,"no i didn't, dad."
3367,Bart,"oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?"
8350,Bart,"boy, you're back!"
2882,Bart,"but you can't kill krusty. he made you what you are. without him, you wouldn't even be called sideshow."
8411,Bart,do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass?
1675,Bart,"the guys who wrote this show don't know squat. itchy should have tied scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend."
2481,Bart,"anyway, hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. i also crush cars into cubes. and on the side, i promote local tough man contests. basically i'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til i go to law school."
12742,Bart,i'm sorry.
9666,Bart,what? no! not until you raise my allowance.
1935,Bart,so i guess we're enemies again.
7213,Bart,wait a minute. i don't have a family anymore!
5647,Bart,"what's the problem, seymour? stuck?"
10725,Bart,yeah... plus i thought i might get to see an air conditioner fall on someone's head. but i guess that never really happens.
1035,Bart,"you know, i was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure."
12499,Bart,"hey, otto-man. i've got a big test that i am not ready for. could you please crash the bus or something?"
10044,Bart,i love saturdays!
3877,Bart,sucker!
540,Bart,"ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
12849,Bart,"luckily, i was not killed that day. although sometimes i wish i had been."
2936,Bart,"so we're just going to do this photo and get out, right? ba-da-bing ba-da-boom?"
10306,Bart,"that was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, you're right."
8183,Bart,"i'm bart simpson, who the hell are you? oh, right. darcy."
1182,Bart,that's your outlaw?
6505,Bart,"second place!? oh man, this'll just encourage her."
5898,Bart,and he gambles like crazy.
10619,Bart,i can offer you a cabin on our sugar-free fitness cruise...
859,Bart,noooo!
5906,Bart,eh. who else we got?
5136,Bart,shut up! shut up!
5893,Bart,ow! you stepped on my arm!
9827,Bart,comin' through!
8266,Bart,build a fart! i love it.
7306,Bart,forget it. my attitude isn't for sale! what am i saying? of course it is!
6737,Bart,i can help you.
12113,Bart,battle stations!
696,Bart,those guys must be millionaires!
7797,Bart,look -- we're havin' pizza tomorrow!
8977,Bart,"fine, go nuts -- see if i care!"
5986,Bart,just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger.
2445,Bart,oh no. it's p.e. sign up day!
8744,Bart,that was a practice cow.
6032,Bart,you're going to stanford! you're going to stanford!
6812,Bart,you'll rent nothing! this money is mine. i found it!
1343,Bart,you don't want to know how far i'll go.
4955,Bart,"well, this has been terrific. let's do it again sometime."
12843,Bart,fine.
12619,Bart,"well yeah, like when you look at ""friday the 13th, part i,"" it's pretty tame by today's standards."
6669,Bart,can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
2588,Bart,"lisa, please, you're too puny to --"
10962,Bart,nah. back to the sweet spot.
520,Bart,"well, it's still fun to be up late."
5510,Bart,okay.
1209,Bart,uh-oh.
11010,Bart,"easy, easy. let's not jump to conclu--"
9547,Bart,what do you mean?
10902,Bart,well i'm afraid that we don't want to be with anyone but mom and whoever she chooses to be with.
5869,Bart,"milhouse, quick!"
4018,Bart,"mom was right, your singing's a sin / you're as les miserables / as lee mar-vin!"
9013,Bart,yeah!
11733,Bart,"way to go, george mucus. the fattest, stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles."
11153,Bart,"sleep well, lis. somehow sewing my head on your shoulder brought us closer together."
2492,Bart,"it looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. come on, boy, you can do it!"
7355,Bart,i'm keepin' it real.
12857,Bart,right on.
3706,Bart,"hey, it's him! it's santa's little helper!"
10319,Bart,and best of all i got funding for my homer humiliator.
10656,Bart,"no, you give them the coupon and they give you the hamburger."
12253,Bart,i gotta go.
3392,Bart,"hey, look! is that dad?"
2510,Bart,"hush, puppies!"
12557,Bart,"i'm not missin'anything. frozen earlobes, trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over again... how good could it be?"
12336,Bart,"welcome back, dad."
10761,Bart,oh no! lisa's face... it's the same!
9477,Bart,"well actually, mom--"
8360,Bart,"i like it -- ""strangles."" hey lis, wanna touch strangles? he's not slimy at all. he's scaly."
6063,Bart,"cool, mom's on drugs. if we turn her in we get a form letter from dick cheney!"
6787,Bart,"if it please the court, i would like to go ape on my sister."
9846,Bart,"uh, nelson... for someone who never goes to the dentist, you have pretty good teeth."
2121,Bart,"barclay, barry, bert, bort?! aw, c'mon, bort?"
2460,Bart,"go ahead and laugh. but i took a chance and did something i wanted to do. and if that makes me a sissy, well then, i guess i'm a sissy."
7102,Bart,future skank!
8494,Bart,fine. i'll call three numbers. what are they?
436,Bart,"krusty, would you do the honors?"
4566,Bart,don't you get it? he swore he'd kill me too. i'm next!
206,Bart,an elephant's butt?
9138,Bart,"yeah, i meant to, i've just been sooo busy. my schedule has been all like ."
636,Bart,mrs. krabappel! that was uncalled for!
11436,Bart,now that's a broken man.
9150,Bart,"before i met you, i was el barto, skinner's bane, the sultan of spitwads, the dean of d-minus, the ay carumba kid!"
5499,Bart,those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. we've gotta warn grampa.
9902,Bart,"for the last three years, i've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike. and all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that i immediately broke and threw in this bag."
9591,Bart,that's no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great.
12707,Bart,no problemo. where's the can opener?
11982,Bart,"hey, that's my pop up there! dad watch out!"
1836,Bart,"look, he thinks he's people."
11369,Bart,i knew you'd escape! were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
11761,Bart,no reason. brother.
11702,Bart,"everyone loves you, dad. you could become a famous rock star!"
5045,Bart,have your cash or food stamps ready!
11012,Bart,"i know this looks bad. and i admit, i would totally lie in a second to lisa or mom or dad. but i would never lie to maggie."
6130,Bart,what?
1241,Bart,"wow! lisa, can you say ""mommy""?"
9709,Bart,sideshow bob!
2384,Bart,what's a chachi?
5424,Bart,quiet. just keep scurrying.
7846,Bart,"oh, that load of crap? no, i was just keepin' her busy while nelson stole microscopes. make with the story."
11054,Bart,you mean my sister?
1843,Bart,you'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
12704,Bart,yeah! where is it?
4603,Bart,"we've been looking all over for you, dad. where did you land?"
11000,Bart,the world is my ring now.
1395,Bart,and there's one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don't think we'll ever forget.
7037,Bart,and i'm happy to listen to f.m. ninety-five point three. home of boomer and the diz!
7717,Bart,"yeah, well i still love this place."
1768,Bart,"you know, conan, i have a lot to say. i'm not just a one line wonder. did you know that a section of rainforest the size of kansas is burned every single..."
4921,Bart,what's that stuff?
8031,Bart,grampa?
9253,Bart,"no, i mean teacher."
3312,Bart,but then they'll just beat me up even worse.
7203,Bart,i'll just pay the fine.
396,Bart,"they're official krusty the clown walkie-talkies. i'll keep one and you keep one. now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
1474,Bart,so's yours.
2083,Bart,"well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the french say, ""bartesque."""
4660,Bart,"mom, am i dying?"
7480,Bart,"no dad, you fell asleep in front of the tv watching ""the towering inferno."""
4994,Bart,ned flanders!
4062,Bart,"we're natural born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down with a family..."
6043,Bart,"hey, the heart wants what it wants, dude."
3630,Bart,"okay crew, set your faces to stunned."
6583,Bart,"well, i'm all set, too."
12391,Bart,"so, basically, i met one nice french person."
3647,Bart,my name is... santa's little helper.
12403,Bart,i wish i could believe you.
2,Bart,"whoa! check out this bitchin' bod! oh man, if i could just have five minutes alone with my old bullies..."
10100,Bart,"dad, how could you do that? the whole audience saw me pee my pants!"
10580,Bart,don't worry. i made sure he can't get too far.
7823,Bart,"oh, how much longer can this go on?"
6285,Bart,a mosquito?
8495,Bart,"okay, so which one of these losers is milhouse's uncle norbert?"

6599,Bart,"krusty, i can't believe you're giving up. i thought you'd make a difference, that's why i voted for you."
7566,Bart,can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?
6642,Bart,"but you're not gonna get divorced like milhouse's parents, are you?"
12682,Bart,"no answer? lisa, listen up."
5222,Bart,"maybe. but if duncan wins the derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud."

8449,Bart,why did you come to our world?
2610,Bart,"you know milhouse, i've been thinking. this town ain't so bad. good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it, springfield's a pretty cool place to live."
6605,Bart,what?
3557,Bart,"well, i guess that'll make things more interesting for you now, won't it?"
12010,Bart,all right!
6503,Bart,huh? why didn't mom make our lunch?

6870,Bart,i thought we had enough money for a good tree.
10233,Bart,"see, dad? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. we're natural enemies, like george washington and abraham lincoln."

1466,Bart,morphine
1501,Bart,you've got to keep working on it.
6525,Bart,you stole my money!

12745,Bart,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry..."
8774,Bart,"you did, dad."
11195,Bart,what's wrong with the one i got?

4150,Bart,"uh, krusty..."
3220,Bart,what is that smell?
11503,Bart,"hm, maybe i can help. but it'll cost you."
11879,Bart,at the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves phoenix bound for santa fe.
4796,Bart,"methuselah, my oldest friend. who did this to you?"
12671,Bart,"lis, what do you call those guys in chess that don't matter?"
1953,Bart,"hey mcbain, i'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
725,Bart,"ohhh, slow down, frenchy! this stuff is gold."
4053,Bart,"yeah, dad?"
10257,Bart,"well, i've learned a lot today. now to go home and let tv slowly rot it all away."
8116,Bart,"please, just leave me alone!"
8598,Bart,"all right, here's the plan: we go in there, fill the coffee pot with crickets from this bag labeled ""crickets"" and leave."
6302,Bart,"tomato, tomato."
12100,Bart,"sorry, man."
8371,Bart,"wow, that's a swear?"
991,Bart,that's not krusty the clown.
7826,Bart,why'd i put this in here?
3533,Bart,"heh, funny, isn't it, lis? those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
12917,Bart,"well, willie, you can take it from here. adios, dude."

12661,Bart,"final score: bart, forty-one. homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six..."
7309,Bart,"come on, chief. i can't afford to pay protection to you and nelson."
1493,Bart,i didn't know you knew luke perry!
10010,Bart,what the? i wanted a mini-bike! i told all my friends i was getting one!
6357,Bart,quiet nerds burp only near school.
7483,Bart,you're gay for moleman!
2041,Bart,can't be what it looks like. this is flanders we're talkin' about.
3358,Bart,"dad, we can't let this happen to belle! do something!"
3562,Bart,who?
12365,Bart,"hey, man, it's me, bart simpson."
5592,Bart,"hey, don't blame me. i gotta compete with tv, and the internet."
10082,Bart,i've got something you can stuff in that old bag.
4556,Bart,oh no! you killed 'em.
2294,Bart,why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? that's where cooties come from.
7524,Bart,"look, i'm really, really sorry. now let me get that ice cream off your shoe."
5739,Bart,oh. hi dad.
626,Bart,"what do you mean, how did i get on the radio? i created the universe! stupid kids."
6211,Bart,"look, the room came with a fruit hat."
408,Bart,one... two... three... community chest.
5988,Bart,"oh, forget it."
4214,Bart,don't talk. listen. the social order of elementary school is densely layered. the coolest kids are at the top.
5036,Bart,"wow, dad, this is the juiciest watermelon i ever tasted."
9368,Bart,i'm bart simpson. who the hell are you?
1886,Bart,"uh, milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. it's a bob mackie original."
7741,Bart,"mom, i really did like hanging out with you."
5425,Bart,"gold! wait, this is just chocolate. chocolate!"
11374,Bart,what are you doing?
3260,Bart,"hey, lisa, make friends with this!"
10970,Bart,really?
917,Bart,but she doesn't melt.
8366,Bart,"santa's little helper, you came too!"
530,Bart,what?
2274,Bart,hey! it's a free country. you get out.
12779,Bart,"hey, otto! can i use that microphone?"
2326,Bart,"well, well, well. i never thought i'd win this easy."
5100,Bart,i want to see how this turns out.
2646,Bart,caution: exit through door seven only. all other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
9692,Bart,"welcome to chaos corners, the pleasure patch, satan's triangle...the one place in town no cameras can see you and no laws can touch you!"
3413,Bart,"hey, what's going on?! wait, wait! hey, let go of me!..."
5619,Bart,that was too close. maybe it's time to quit the game.
3632,Bart,wait a second. you don't have to leave just because superintendent chalmers told you to.
12611,Bart,are we scared yet?
2625,Bart,death to shelbyville!
6704,Bart,the fly's stuck in flanders' house!
1592,Bart,be be be be be.
9883,Bart,it's getting a little chilly -- i'd better put a blanket on ray.
1462,Bart,maybe you better take that temperature one more time.
3998,Bart,"hey, since when is christmas just about the presents? aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? the birth of santa?"
3678,Bart,the dog and i got a credit card and...
7780,Bart,i've gotta get dad a lousy tie!
6095,Bart,"hey, i didn't lead her on. i always played it light and breezy."
10025,Bart,it's still here! yes! i get the flash drive back and the manila envelope.
827,Bart,"if you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it."
381,Bart,"that is not funny, lewis."
8698,Bart,daddy's back and she's feelin' like she oughter!
11979,Bart,nothin'.
5775,Bart,that tour is mine.
2807,Bart,it's gone.
3376,Bart,"are you nuts? i'll probably never say this to you again, but you can do better."
3015,Bart,"don't be a sap, dad. these are just crappy knock-offs."
11700,Bart,"help me, desert weirdoes!"
5812,Bart,good grief.
10764,Bart,are the credits transferable?
12560,Bart,"do you want to be held back a grade? concentrate, man."
2968,Bart,i told you i don't have anything.
5905,Bart,can't live this way... anymore.
1219,Bart,"quiet, biet, diet, ziet, fiet..."
6437,Bart,"dad, i can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own."
9710,Bart,i'll prove i'm not crazy. sideshow bob could never resist singing along to a gilbert and sullivan operetta.
3875,Bart,oh! ow! uh!
7520,Bart,i'm not fat!
192,Bart,shut up! shut up!
1029,Bart,"dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? hubba, hubba."

4423,Bart,when are mom and dad coming back?
1084,Bart,i promise.
12007,Bart,"oh, c'mon dad! anything but that!"
2035,Bart,there was an optics festival and i wasn't informed? you go now.
6292,Bart,i got me some teachers to lick.
9595,Bart,"hey willie, does he taste like failure?"
10955,Bart,"don't worry, all i need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper."
10246,Bart,"'allo, luvs!"
7857,Bart,"look, it's been fun and all, but i miss indoor plumbing."
5688,Bart,"man, is that wimpy!"
6575,Bart,"c'mon man, everyone knows the first day of school is a total wank."
9747,Bart,"and now, owned by one of the ugliest families in springfield... ""satan's little helper""!"
8389,Bart,"keep pitching, i'll be back."

11168,Bart,"fifty percent attention-seeking, fifty percent to drop things on people."
9007,Bart,"she said something about ""the bottom of the ocean"" and ""be back in a month."""
2298,Bart,it's just hard not to listen to tv. it's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
2258,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i didn't..."

2252,Bart,"lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist."

3933,Bart,good.
679,Bart,"hey, once again. great present, dad."
7126,Bart,"what is your deal, anyway?"
6321,Bart,lisa is a dork. lisa is a dork.
3504,Bart,"man, those cons love krusty. inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy."
6880,Bart,"please, make me write something on the chalkboard a thousand times!"
5422,Bart,"this is way better than camp. no mosquitoes, no stupid camp songs..."
11101,Bart,are there other people in here?

5295,Bart,"hey, dad. my band finally got a break. i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. how about a little loanski?"
196,Bart,how many teeth do i have?
11731,Bart,"before we vote, i'd just like to point out in sophie's choice she saved the boy."
4429,Bart,"okay, here's the deal. crowns and doubloons are mine. snuff boxes and cameos are yours. now as for wands and scepters..."
10835,Bart,i don't think you even like santa's little helper!

5571,Bart,rusty the clown?! springfield gets the lamest balloons.
157,Bart,"listen lady, i can leave without screaming, and i can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that i am saying thank you."
5463,Bart,home improvement...
11674,Bart,when he opens the door...
3748,Bart,looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.
10281,Bart,there really is a phone in there?
7634,Bart,"well, if you're lookin' for lisa, she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back."
6663,Bart,"hey, let's see if dad's song is finally off the air."
7685,Bart,thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
10081,Bart,"hm, wrong hands, eh? that's your cue, boys."
7737,Bart,you're not allowed in here! can't you read the sign?
2984,Bart,"wow, look at all the colors, man!"

2313,Bart,thank you.
4586,Bart,"not now lis, i'm trying to relax."
1967,Bart,"keep up the good work, toots."
9574,Bart,"hi, nikki. i'm bart. this situation, it's nuts, right?"

4099,Bart,whatever. just tell wendell i said bye.
6930,Bart,"okay i've been studying frink's robot, and i've discovered he has one small weak spot."
3464,Bart,"hey, i know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?"
10653,Bart,hmmm.
3804,Bart,"uh, you can make it, lisa! i know you can! come on, i know you can do it! just get your hands back on the rope! it's just a little further! come on, just a little bit more. etc. i know you can do it! i believe in you!"
13087,Bart,"why don't you fetch it yourself, man."
3468,Bart,wow -- poochie came from another planet?
9814,Bart,there comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
8443,Bart,"well, i have to look good for tomorrow."
2829,Bart,'fraid so.
8634,Bart,"whoa, check that out!"
4464,Bart,"hang on, dad, this next part'll definitely make you feel better about yourself."
473,Bart,"i'm afraid not, rabbi. it's from ""yes, i can"" by sammy davis jr. an entertainer like your son."
1804,Bart,"hey, dad... sell you these for fifty bucks."
3968,Bart,you didn't do anything.
8290,Bart,another senseless killing by... the shadow knight!
5810,Bart,a girl at school won't go to the dance with me.
3348,Bart,so who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
2618,Bart,hey! they're taking our lemons!
12737,Bart,"best thanksgiving ever, eh boy?"
6496,Bart,what if she doesn't?
12547,Bart,okay.
11770,Bart,you think so?
6367,Bart,the capital city goofball?
12701,Bart,"who? wait a minute, who's that?"
8777,Bart,let's just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it's nice for the next people.
2254,Bart,unseasonable warmth...?
3502,Bart,huh?
1722,Bart,"yo! lis! lis! come back, lis! come back!"
273,Bart,lisa... lisa... lisa.
1457,Bart,"well, according to this, snakes ""hear"" by sensing vibrations in the ground. so, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes'll be in here like oprah on a baked ham."
12050,Bart,but i can't squeal. it would violate the code of the school yard.
2382,Bart,i don't think any of us expected him to say that.
6969,Bart,there's one right now.
4651,Bart,"dad, don't you see what's going on?"
6380,Bart,here.
501,Bart,"i love you, dad."

904,Bart,bo-ring!
8945,Bart,this is hard!
3327,Bart,what time?
2424,Bart,i'll pick you up on the way home.
7196,Bart,"nash, i've realized something. i'm the worst kid in the world, and the last thing i deserve is forgiveness. but with a little help from jesus and our fighting men and women overseas--"
4723,Bart,"all right, the personals! hmm. hm-hm-hm. ""successful mayor-type seeks open-minded, discreet cheerleader-type."""
3399,Bart,"yes, i do. you seem so damn sure."
5841,Bart,"yeah, thanks for the grub."
10819,Bart,"look. that kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!"
11916,Bart,it ain't over till the fat lady sings.
7891,Bart,cool! no gravity!
4573,Bart,"ow! that's my face, you idiot!"
6924,Bart,"dad, it was so great -- knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
13104,Bart,this time is so precious -- don't waste it!
10298,Bart,yep.
507,Bart,"hey, man, you were crushing me. i tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
3244,Bart,my friendship. you know you want it.
6199,Bart,"dad, that line was in the cartoon."
1467,Bart,morphine
11555,Bart,no! turn it off! it's too intense for me!
989,Bart,"lisa, i've been thinking it over, and next summer i am getting a job."
7408,Bart,"so, lis, ready for your trip?"
54,Bart,"grampa, mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. it's a list of the things lisa and i can and can't do."
6766,Bart,just keep it above the belt.
4200,Bart,"look out, ralph!"
9579,Bart,can i draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my sharpie?
2552,Bart,"mom, i need a dollar. ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. and i need that money for candy."
2016,Bart,"people, people, it's time we all discussed the pool safety rules."
2309,Bart,"scary, no? and this guy's head of the spaceology department at the correspondence college of tampa!"
10180,Bart,not to worry.
7667,Bart,the other likes to chase a cow
2225,Bart,"you're right, lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. i'm just going to give her up cold turkey. i'm not gonna talk to her or see her. it's over. thanks for the advice, sis."
6749,Bart,"""superman vs. patty hearst,"" ""evel knievel jumps the jackson 5,"" ""batman and rhoda""..."
12134,Bart,"yo, chump, you back again?"
9370,Bart,"so, charlie, how did you escape the island of misfit boys?"
252,Bart,poor house.
7812,Bart,"well, i guess it's tinkle time."
12594,Bart,do it again.
12965,Bart,no way! you can't give my dog away! i'll set fire to my hair! i'll rip up all my clothes! i'll put sugar in the gas tank!
8239,Bart,and... my dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. he's always passed out in the parking snot.
10864,Bart,wheee!
9843,Bart,it's nelson!
3153,Bart,"branson, missouri. my dad says it's like vegas if it were run by ned flanders."
9529,Bart,i've gotta get that letter before mom and dad do. stay focused...
4134,Bart,oh.
4963,Bart,"that's right. you stay on the ball, you stay on the wall."
13127,Bart,i guess so.
9876,Bart,"the top dog is me, followed by the top dog, the dog... ...then the cat... then you... but don't feel bad, you're ahead of milhouse."
6378,Bart,"i used to be lost. until a friend turned me onto a book. a book that changed my life. it's called ""lisa is stupid."""
287,Bart,"mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
6029,Bart,"well, i'd like to trust you, homer. but you've been in jail three times."
10749,Bart,"hey, homer."
9060,Bart,just don't stretch it out.
3512,Bart,"um... nah, that's not his style."
9725,Bart,i can't see!
8123,Bart,help! help!
4705,Bart,"dad, that doesn't belong to you."
9448,Bart,huh?
8513,Bart,whoa! the infamous wolverine comic with pop-out claws!
4634,Bart,we heard you the first time.
7271,Bart,this isn't what it looks like.
6923,Bart,...then knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
7925,Bart,it hurts when i swallow.
10381,Bart,let's steal back our book.
480,Bart,x-ray specs.
2210,Bart,jessica we just...
10447,Bart,"tired of what? i dump on you, and you take it -- that's how friendship works."
1905,Bart,"mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. what is it with you?"
8625,Bart,willie?! you're on skinner's side?
1015,Bart,"excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin' through... how ya doin'?... love that hat, baby..."
3071,Bart,makes sense to me.
9269,Bart,glad you didn't come cheap.
6768,Bart,"but i miss being a regular kid in the real world, gettin' a hug from my mom..."
8850,Bart,that felt good.
1790,Bart,how about me?
1085,Bart,sucker.
1488,Bart,well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
9119,Bart,"boy, you make it look effortless. and that kid's giving you zero pump."
4284,Bart,but flanders got his kids torpedoes.
3825,Bart,principal skinner?
11081,Bart,tv's not so bad.
1695,Bart,i'm a nerd.
2036,Bart,go!
4395,Bart,"the world is completely different on a weekday morning. banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity..."
4958,Bart,"memo to self: shut up, lisa."
1906,Bart,i need something for show and tell.
6162,Bart,buck mccoy.
5995,Bart,are you talking about a soul patch?
5482,Bart,"you're missing the best part, sister. forget that stupid book."
8033,Bart,"no, i'm gonna go backstage and complain. this krusty brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face."
10610,Bart,"i can't, i sold my ""dinner futures."""
7107,Bart,cowabunga one to fat load.
11591,Bart,i'll get to it when i get to it.
9600,Bart,absolutely not.
911,Bart,"no, that's okay. you can stay. you can read comics with us. let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""radioactive man vs. the swamp hag."
5426,Bart,flavor's gone.
12436,Bart,"see that? krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people."
905,Bart,"how would i go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?"
810,Bart,is there a doggie hell?
9912,Bart,"well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? just stick a bow on the toy and you're ready to go."
3259,Bart,"i guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough, but it did teach you a lesson: it's important to be yourself."
11031,Bart,cool! they give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.
2799,Bart,"i think lisa's right, dad. eating meat is ba-a-a-ad."
4143,Bart,clear the couch. it's krusty time!
2160,Bart,of course!
6613,Bart,hey! you nearly hit me on the head!
3190,Bart,"figures... hey, mr. burns!"
11709,Bart,"if it helps, i made you a card."
924,Bart,"uh, sure."
11553,Bart,um... that's kind of a baby show.
7284,Bart,um-huh.
4600,Bart,she's down.
7478,Bart,"lis, that place is great! they have a jukebox in the basement! and look at the trick they taught me!"
4735,Bart,"whoooa! you the man, mom!"
3566,Bart,"ohhhhh, bed! oh. well, anything you say, sis."
5183,Bart,"song's over, milhouse. but you're welcome."
12591,Bart,are you my conscience?
2541,Bart,juh?
11547,Bart,no.
9133,Bart,"um, if this girl i'm seeing comes here, and she might, i wouldn't mind if you told her i was the kind of boy that does the dishes."
661,Bart,"mom, it's too big."
9046,Bart,what kind of pencil do we take again?
9290,Bart,so all you did was ring her doorbell and run?
7365,Bart,"well, i paid for this ticket. that makes me an adult. i'm going."
3037,Bart,"i'm sorry for all the trouble i've caused you, krusty. but, you know, my mom says god never closes a door without opening a window."
10140,Bart,"the name's ""bart."""
10106,Bart,"okay, first i'll send down my shoes."
2080,Bart,"way to go, lis. i mean, why compete with someone who's just gonna kick your butt anyway?"
105,Bart,please dad.
4292,Bart,time to reap the benefits of being cool.
6844,Bart,you're sneakin' out to fight that bear. i wanna go too.
11965,Bart,"don't give up, dad."
1684,Bart,a rescue plane! get the flare gun!
6731,Bart,"after this prank, everyone's gonna hate those cavalry clods as much as we do."
5859,Bart,what's it like riding a girl's bike?
12123,Bart,"sorry, dad. women and children first."
12731,Bart,"all right. twelve big ones and free grub to boot. viva skid row. hey, it's that anchor dude from channel six."
413,Bart,"don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
11207,Bart,maggie hits harder.
12470,Bart,ask if there's a reward!
7669,Bart,no!
4649,Bart,"but, da--"
1235,Bart,stupid mailman... squeal on me...
3051,Bart,"lisa! look! a signature with stars around it, just like krusty's!"
3227,Bart,what religion are you?
9672,Bart,"dear lord, you've got the wind i need, i've got the prayers you crave. let's make a deal."
1118,Bart,itchy.
270,Bart,that's cause she knows you're looking at her.
10075,Bart,fine. how's it goin'?
8367,Bart,sorry... but a boy's gotta go with his dog.

211,Bart,"dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. and i know you. you're an emotional guy. just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. so i..."
315,Bart,"yo, sensei, can i go to the bathroom?"
11391,Bart,why would you want to do that? he's tried to kill us.
3552,Bart,"i didn't say i was gonna eat them. i just wanted to look at them, because they're so gross. what's for dessert?"

10607,Bart,"okay... maybe i can pay for the cruise. let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group z lifeboat access... it's still a ton of money."
12816,Bart,that reminds me. i've gotta get over to milhouse's and... uh... play sports.
12693,Bart,"this is pretty tense, isn't it, todd?"
6883,Bart,"also, maggie puked in your purse again."
365,Bart,they're not mine. my boss said his warehouse was full.
9743,Bart,i think i've come up with the answer.

11105,Bart,"hey, one of those notes could go to your brain and kill you. are you sure you want to take that chance?"
6251,Bart,"wow! ""angry dad""... an internet cartoon. i'll be in cyberspace next to the nabisco cookie web site."
8996,Bart,"okay, next, here's the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick: coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. the only thing that's safe is the pork chops."
12999,Bart,"give it to us, grampa."

6291,Bart,contagious? outrageous!
4348,Bart,"groundskeeper willie! uhm. ah. so, so you're the immigrant i'm here to help."

9576,Bart,"whoa. damn, this caterpillar can eat! damn! damn!!!"
2086,Bart,"well, we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in front of the students and faculty."
613,Bart,"digital audio tape, my butt! when i was a kid, we had compact discs, and i don't recall no one complaining."
6425,Bart,"oh man, i can't wear this. i look like buster brown, whoever that is."
3640,Bart,"oh, no problemo. so, i guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh?"
12538,Bart,then it's a deal.

5135,Bart,my skin! my beautiful skin!
491,Bart,"oh, there. that's better."
3181,Bart,maybe it's time to put him in one where he can't get out.
12219,Bart,"ah, cool, man. space mutants 4. drop me off! drop me off!"
1407,Bart,what are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?

4355,Bart,shut up! i'm trying to watch this.
2046,Bart,"he's gonna kill rod and todd, too... that's horrible. in principle."
772,Bart,"uh, i don't know how that got in there."
5165,Bart,"... then i said ""i have the power"" and the bucket came off!"
9589,Bart,it's not my fault -- grampa told me to kiss her!
9169,Bart,la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
6293,Bart,"i don't like how many times you said ""normal."""
12844,Bart,i am in constant pain.

10003,Bart,kids don't deliver newspapers anymore. it's just creeps in trucks.
9938,Bart,keep him safe from shanks and shivs. let him become rich in the jailyard currencies of cigarettes and dried fish...
6840,Bart,"i'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. and then, finally, i can eat my shorts."

11092,Bart,every good booger deserves flicking.
8975,Bart,"no, i mean you're loco in the coco!"
7816,Bart,"well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, i wouldn't be so screwed up."
12826,Bart,i think it sucks.
9439,Bart,hell no.
7618,Bart,dad! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees!
10844,Bart,you'd have to wrap cheese around it.
716,Bart,suppose i was writing a second letter to a girl and i already used up my a material. what should i say?
5785,Bart,"party posse, we rule the earth / the greatest band since music's birth."
2447,Bart,"okay, steady bart. taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."

7256,Bart,"lis, look!"
5355,Bart,"guys, the thing is, we totally have the money. and we tried to wire it to you, but you know how banks screw up."
9860,Bart,i'm playing with my sergeant activity doll.
7151,Bart,"what did those women expect? when you sign a contract with fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated."
67,Bart,"not yet, but the afternoon is young."
2324,Bart,"so much for the days when i could say ""at least my mother's normal."""
2145,Bart,kindergarten?
1603,Bart,"you're absolutely right, homer. we don't need a baby-sitter."
12460,Bart,"you know what happens. they find captain kook's treasure, all the elves dance around like little green idiots, i puke, the end."
5760,Bart,i thought i was your arch-enemy.
1220,Bart,krusty funny.

5011,Bart,"whoa! hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing!"
4558,Bart,"go, chirpy boy! go, bart junior!"
12527,Bart,"well, i've been failing a lot of tests recently."
8965,Bart,how'd you like a shortcut to the bottom of the river?
514,Bart,... move your joystick to the left.
8189,Bart,really? we didn't? but we kissed and held hands at the same time.
4418,Bart,"okay, be that way. be a big, stupid jerk."
1204,Bart,got your wallet.
103,Bart,please dad.
9155,Bart,you're right. i've gotta straighten this out.
502,Bart,yaahhh!
430,Bart,"why bother, they'll just get dirty again."
10263,Bart,a man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.
10451,Bart,"listen, um... after our fight, i couldn't sleep."
7517,Bart,what the family?!
7851,Bart,and... joust!
11696,Bart,no. this ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life. and i'm gonna wreck it. because he scarred me forever!
10234,Bart,"if fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible."
9581,Bart,"dad, i know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school i kind of like."
8888,Bart,i didn't even notice.
45,Bart,what?
7748,Bart,"hey losers, i'm gonna do to you what you did to these songs."

7852,Bart,let's do it again!
4613,Bart,"well, why don't you just pull it out?"
11355,Bart,"you don't still think that, do you?"
8572,Bart,"sorry i'm late -- i was in a car crash. many hurt, but nobody cool was harmed."
10824,Bart,terrible commercials!

7703,Bart,"now, enjoy scenery. enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
2407,Bart,"draining? oh, i don't care about that anymore."
9535,Bart,but dad said i had to finish--
4334,Bart,but is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers?
728,Bart,"well, she's dangled on the line long enough. it's time to boat this bass."
9331,Bart,huh?
12662,Bart,wow! free balloons for everyone who enters!
8512,Bart,"lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, superman dies, aquaman dies, casper dies, caveman robin, black robin, born-again robin..."
7616,Bart,"so, how are we related again?"
4163,Bart,"i don't get it, krusty. you said you would never be a shill again."
9887,Bart,you really don't get it.
426,Bart,this could be the start of something big...
6195,Bart,"dad, these old stories can't compare with our modern super-writers. stephen bochco could kick shakespeare's ass."
9987,Bart,"melody, you're a great girl, but... i see you as more of a sister... and i don't like my sister."
12054,Bart,"uh, not really."
3044,Bart,mom! i just saw krusty!
12454,Bart,what a grump.
7693,Bart,"yeah, maybe. what did you used to do?"
4485,Bart,"your electric hammer, maestro?"

5638,Bart,wait a minute. this whole thing was a set-up?!
5896,Bart,big phony!
11668,Bart,"dad, it-it's me!"
5075,Bart,there's gotta be something fun in my parents' closet.

4431,Bart,"whoa, excellent haul!"
11835,Bart,can we?
7918,Bart,"duh! nobody wants their address painted on the curb. we do it without asking, and then they have to pay."
7253,Bart,"mom, this was the worst party ever."
13131,Bart,totally. right after i fiddle with these dials and levers.
5083,Bart,"i can't take mr. burns to the ho'pital 'cause i'm too dumb to read a map. oh, why did my school have to close?"
11606,Bart,"hey lame ass. thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat."
3245,Bart,no. they must have seen you.
7222,Bart,i gotta be honest -- i don't see what all the hubbub is about.

4577,Bart,hmm...
10699,Bart,"dad, can i ask you a question? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you?"
4000,Bart,"please, i don't deserve this."

6711,Bart,"hey, i didn't get where i am putting tops on things."
7051,Bart,"hey, as long as they're not hurting anybody."
11751,Bart,"yeah! listen, homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up?"
1951,Bart,"oh, my god, he is like some sort of non... giving up... school guy."

3723,Bart,"c'mon, santa's little helper! i'm sorry i ever let you go! pick me! please pick me!"
2473,Bart,you made a movie?
9606,Bart,nikki! thanks for saving my life.

11216,Bart,"you gotta get on your game, sister. you think i'm tough? wait till gutierrez sinks her teeth into you."
2335,Bart,or a fjord.
9003,Bart,"dad! these people are my friends! don't fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is bin laden!"
1678,Bart,"actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip."
12290,Bart,mmm. wednesday -- hoagie night.
9947,Bart,when did this happen?
9097,Bart,"yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock."
10647,Bart,"lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! mom and dad, you were more happy and in love than i ever saw you!"
2763,Bart,geez. you're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
10247,Bart,i'm mrs. knickertwist! and i've had a proper hardy-har at your expense!
12379,Bart,"uh, no thanks."
4690,Bart,"wow, it's ours?"

42,Bart,please dad.
4192,Bart,he's a robot. we saw him on the way in.
7532,Bart,not for long -- i'm saying goodbye to scammer and z-dog. i've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
7553,Bart,"mom, am i a ""butch"" or a ""fem""?"
3339,Bart,she makes me taste beer.
7534,Bart,i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap.
9688,Bart,"blonde guys aren't dumb. they're evil. like in ""the karate kid"" and world war two."
7308,Bart,sorry.
10768,Bart,the five boxing wizards jump quickly? whoa! my sister's finally become... mildly interesting!
1861,Bart,so long stampy. i know you're gonna like it here.

12189,Bart,"yeah, man."
6289,Bart,"no, i told you, a mosquito came out of my laffy meal and bit me."
11849,Bart,"it's a coincidence, dad."
11131,Bart,"more like the ""expandables""!"
5613,Bart,"i just gotta get him back!... or if not him, a similar dog..."
3454,Bart,"yeah, mom. i mean, we love you and dad too, but god knows we don't need to see you every day."
10151,Bart,"back of the line, stranger!"
8538,Bart,stupid sideshow bob. even when he's dead he wrecks my life. i hope he's in hell eating a barf burger.
2358,Bart,so what am i supposed to do exactly?
11415,Bart,well there's plenty of room... because pokey's gone.
3985,Bart,whoa... yeah...

379,Bart,"he sure is, patrone."
3346,Bart,"oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss. no problemo."
2091,Bart,right on!
3957,Bart,"it's probably a million years old, dad. i think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
4799,Bart,"i'll just give goliath two the ol' rock to the head, applause applause, ""ya gotta believe in yourself, stay in school,"" and we're outta here."
735,Bart,what about coach fortner?
2867,Bart,look at that hunk o' junk.

12390,Bart,"hey, homer."
11307,Bart,and what if i don't?
2002,Bart,"yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company in it."
8923,Bart,a candy corn volcano! a ceiling from saddam's palace!
8306,Bart,"gee moe, you give great advice."
12468,Bart,"we know who you are, ms. botz. or should i say, ms. botzucowski. you're the babysitter bandit."
9656,Bart,i can't believe you're making us go to a birthday party for a kid we don't even know.
4037,Bart,"wow, the tooth chipper!"
6916,Bart,ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we've gotta go fight some robots.
11978,Bart,"gee, dad's a hero."
11208,Bart,did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
12224,Bart,it didn't hurt.
9821,Bart,where the hell are we? i've never seen stores like these before.
73,Bart,please dad.
4461,Bart,you can't come back later because...
7802,Bart,what's your system?
7323,Bart,here's fifty.
2224,Bart,"no, no, wait. hear my plan. i put up with her for seven more years. then, we'll get married. once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. after all, i deserve it."
11498,Bart,so i did make her pregnant?
12827,Bart,"nah. come on, lis."
9815,Bart,this stupid thing never works.
6970,Bart,it is not ralph.
955,Bart,"oh no, mrs. krabappel. if i don't get a c average, my dad won't let me go to kamp krusty."
11725,Bart,not enough ketchup!

2992,Bart,"who's that, george?"
9824,Bart,we'll see.
10196,Bart,time to get my mischief on!
3633,Bart,"you've spent your whole life following orders -- from your mother, the army, superintendent chalmers. just this once, man, stand up for yourself."
6255,Bart,"what up, man? this is my manager slash sister, lisa."
1090,Bart,or you could let me go play with milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable mexican sitcoms.
1326,Bart,"another beer, dad?"
4327,Bart,"it's about a man. a simple man. he's one of... ""bart's people."""

9601,Bart,"yeah, till they find out about us."
4514,Bart,oh my god...

8255,Bart,ping!
6661,Bart,"hey beavers! remember me, you buck-toothed nerds?"
7596,Bart,"why did you guys have to take me away? you're always nagging me to go to church, and now that i am, it's the wrong one."
11364,Bart,then why is diggs there?
11379,Bart,i'll take that.
7785,Bart,"mr. fairbanks, lookin' at your boat i gotta say, gramma bet on the wrong horse."
3379,Bart,spin the middle side topwise. topwise.
1358,Bart,"hey lis, look what i can do."
8891,Bart,"dad, look at me! look at me!"
3048,Bart,am i going crazy? i'm seeing krusty everywhere.
10769,Bart,i don't hear anything.
3217,Bart,"homer, first of all it's ""par-tay."" and second, we wouldn't par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth."
4079,Bart,"i kinda think it's cool. just pretend you're in a zombie movie. besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc."
5979,Bart,nuh-uh.
3644,Bart,"gas your termites... ""freeze your termites""... ""zap your termites""... ""save the termites""... hel-lo."
2868,Bart,so how do you know so much about american history?
1914,Bart,"principal skinner... um, i'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg."
2234,Bart,i didn't take it.
5436,Bart,"you okay, milhouse?"
11,Bart,aye carumba!
5330,Bart,"now, this ""play"" button's a little screwed up, so you gotta hold it down."
1372,Bart,that is one evil dude.
7154,Bart,"dad, i feel like i'm gonna throw up."
2238,Bart,that doesn't make any sense.
1116,Bart,come on. what d'ya say?
7811,Bart,"well dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame."
5164,Bart,full coverage... hmm...

9741,Bart,"hang on, here's a spot that still looks good."
9767,Bart,"no, we can't stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team."
149,Bart,there's a reason.
1291,Bart,"mitch, you're doing a bang-up job."
10259,Bart,no sir.
9359,Bart,"i just wanted a baby brother, but dad said i was one ""uday"" who didn't need a ""qusay."" i just wanted what lisa and maggie have."
542,Bart,aye carumba!

12347,Bart,hello.
2669,Bart,"burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. right, dad? dad? homer?"

4673,Bart,"oh no, it won't."
10135,Bart,oh man. i can't believe we have to pick the peaches ourselves. this activity is so lame i'm gonna daydream about school.
1481,Bart,i can't believe it. he stole this bit from krusty!

9171,Bart,the washington monument?
12354,Bart,"so long, sucker."

9277,Bart,"hey, lis."
1631,Bart,i'm blue. time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
5974,Bart,"so, your honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, i ask that you punish me."
2866,Bart,"way to guard the parking lot, top gun."
4824,Bart,"yeah, he's done."
7289,Bart,i thought it was chocolate milk!
21,Bart,"oh man, you sound like my art teacher. look a little like her too."
10642,Bart,"it was all a hoax, there's no virus."
7598,Bart,don't have... a cow man / don't have... a cow man / don't have... a cow man / have a piece of fish! oy!
9627,Bart,i already do that.
9750,Bart,"let's see what we've got here. krusty drunk on ""the tonight show,"" krusty drunk on ""the today show,"" krusty confesses to self-mutilation on match game p.m., ""krusty trips the pope,"" ""krusty vomits in baby carriage"", ""krusty uses child as shield"", ""krusty celebrity poker freak-out"", ""krusty super bowl nip slip"" ah, here we are, ""krusty on ""the electric company."""
11987,Bart,i'm picking respect.
4078,Bart,"yeah, maybe it'll wear off. like his interest in c.b. radio."
11367,Bart,what kind of cheer-up talk is this?
3725,Bart,"oh geez, i'm sorry. i wish there was some way we could both have a dog."
1668,Bart,"aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?"
11015,Bart,"yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?"
786,Bart,"every day is a new fight, sir."
12842,Bart,but i played baseball this morning!
12744,Bart,i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
12870,Bart,"oh, it will not."
7626,Bart,"oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesn't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon."
8079,Bart,what are you gonna do about it?
1135,Bart,here's my test.
8626,Bart,well... i guess we're even. what are you gonna do now?
5070,Bart,p.s. we've taken your old lady.

6359,Bart,"canada's governors general: ""clowns love haircuts; so should lee marvin's valet."""
11332,Bart,wait! wait! wait! who the hell are you?
2222,Bart,we could get in trouble for being late.
2918,Bart,"then how come it says ""2nd player score""?!"

8434,Bart,"don't click the cart, or you bought it!"
1641,Bart,"keep cool, simpson. be in the game, but not of the game."

8267,Bart,that might work too.
12788,Bart,but i want to tell them about my jump.
2377,Bart,"wow, dad. maybe you're right."
1098,Bart,sounds like something you'd say.
992,Bart,"all right, that's it! i've been scorched by krusty before. i got a rapid heart beat from those krusty brand vitamins; my krusty calculator didn't have a 7 or an 8; and krusty's autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. but this time he's gone too far. we want krusty! we want krusty!"
2928,Bart,"everything except ""capiche""..."
4557,Bart,"whoa, look at 'em."
268,Bart,"lisa, her teeth are big and green / lisa, she smells like gasoline / lisa, da da da deesa / she is my sis-ta, her birthday i missed-ta."
12681,Bart,piece of cake.
11294,Bart,homer!
1591,Bart,big deal. it's no different from the basement in grampa's rest home.
553,Bart,"well, i picked it up somewhere. and if i drive martin's car i can win. i'm sorry, but..."
3952,Bart,tradition.
7285,Bart,"god, please give your daughter the tooth fairy the strength to carry my cash, and the integrity not to dip her wand in the till."
8300,Bart,it was just a game. a game i used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
495,Bart,phone.
2523,Bart,"strike, eh?"
2850,Bart,what isn't he doing?
12955,Bart,"go home, boy! go... home!"

2107,Bart,"but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half. can we go, dad? can we can we can we, take it, lis."
10510,Bart,"but it's my home now, sir."
9344,Bart,lisa got a sister! why can't you have another boy?
6430,Bart,i'm so cold.
13001,Bart,"let's see, i want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts..."
11506,Bart,only if they have five dollars.
9654,Bart,"goodbye, annie, my eight-legged friend."
3970,Bart,so long! / good-bye! / good luck!
8029,Bart,mind your own beeswax!
6754,Bart,"wow, she looks like a background character in a hanna barbera cartoon!"
1341,Bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
401,Bart,"milhouse, a little salt?"
8001,Bart,how can i end this torture?!
12364,Bart,"hey, man, watch it."
11467,Bart,"so you see, we can't let jailbird fry."
1698,Bart,"whoa, what the hell..."
7963,Bart,"bye-bye, take care, watch your step, eat my shorts, have a good one..."
2076,Bart,"suit yourself. but if you change your mind, here's my card."
6677,Bart,"hey boy, this is your commercial!"
8578,Bart,no.
5607,Bart,"what happened? where's my cake? it's all right, isn't it?"
8059,Bart,"whoa, even the army has humvees now!"
4063,Bart,"um, hey, dad, i, i think he wants a..."
1187,Bart,"dad, who's watching tv at 3:17 a.m.?"
1402,Bart,...but you always looked out for me.
9339,Bart,stupid shoes over tights! why did i want to play with a couple of lame-o girls?
6912,Bart,"face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. but you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. that's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news."
5610,Bart,"here, boy! here doggie. oh where has my little dog gone?"
3094,Bart,there's a box you can sleep in.
6680,Bart,who's gonna eat my homework now?
10177,Bart,i jumped in front of your picture! now it's ruined!
3285,Bart,"you can't protect them every second. sooner or later you'll let your guard down, and then -- flush! it's toilet time for tiny town."

3578,Bart,i'm banging my head! i'm going to make the lump even bigger!
9304,Bart,wait! the burger didn't change me! i'm not a muncher!

3087,Bart,itchy runs afoul of an irishman.
561,Bart,ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! loser! nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
148,Bart,"not yet, but at least i'm in a lot of pain."
9142,Bart,"look, man. i have to keep my dark past hidden. there's someone new in my life now."
1196,Bart,homer!
10358,Bart,tween-lit gang-write?

7209,Bart,take the sob sister act somewhere else -- you're standin' in my light!
4253,Bart,"c'mon, ralph. don't embarrass me. it's just an abandoned prison. all the murderers are long dead... and i'm sure their ghosts are probably in hell."
10034,Bart,take that back!
9863,Bart,"this town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
5626,Bart,"please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail. we just made one mistake."
5196,Bart,why won't anybody listen to me? i don't have any special powers! i am not a healer!
10302,Bart,i'll tell you my project: a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd.
4261,Bart,wow! look at all these toilets. and just inches from your bed. talk about luxury.
11248,Bart,you'll really help me get revenge?
4882,Bart,cool!

2998,Bart,"why hello, mrs. bush."
8374,Bart,"dammit, these blueprints are all wrong! where's the roller coaster room? and the shark tank?"
9035,Bart,slurp my snot.
11589,Bart,the cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
5232,Bart,"oh, man. why does everything bad have to happen to me?"
2317,Bart,"cheer up, homer."
3660,Bart,"aw, you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since i gave you those pep pills."
1443,Bart,i guess that's it. i just can't be educated. i can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
5727,Bart,it wasn't dad's fault. the ape tricked him. what's next?
6618,Bart,"i'm telling! oh, man."
2650,Bart,wait! i got it! i got it!

4433,Bart,"hey, you're back. did you rock the casbah?"
10317,Bart,"so, the soft fur, big eyes and gentle motion are designed to make it one helluva pet with none of the poop."
2261,Bart,"aw thanks, dad."
2773,Bart,what?!
11343,Bart,"fly! fly! c'mon, man! do the wing thing!"
9923,Bart,huh? i thought you said you didn't want a tree.
5466,Bart,"i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school, and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt."

3203,Bart,"consarn it, he's getting away!"
8491,Bart,"if he could go back to being happy, i could go back to being cool."

12069,Bart,yeah!

2668,Bart,"i'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. i swear it."
3575,Bart,"oh, no! i'm going to preserve the evidence until mom and dad get home..."

1079,Bart,"just more of me to love, honey."
10750,Bart,"i'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!"
286,Bart,"wow, little meatloaf men!"
12092,Bart,it bounces off us and sticks to you.
10758,Bart,give yourself a wedgie.
6906,Bart,"yeah, great workmanship."
12771,Bart,this is so cool.
5286,Bart,"dude, you know i'm good for it. i'll have plenty of money when my lawsuit pays off."
2171,Bart,eh?
10256,Bart,"really? i wanted to learn more about trust busting. take that, standard oil!"
3403,Bart,"yo, dad, can i have a sip of your beer?"
1174,Bart,jimbo jones?
6415,Bart,lisa learned a lesson! lisa learned a lesson!
5881,Bart,who's next?
11515,Bart,"well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell!"
9044,Bart,"i wrote ""slurp my snot"" in the ovals on the answer sheet. true story."
12396,Bart,"we don't expect you to, mom."
6405,Bart,"what's with the belt, mom?"
7919,Bart,that's honest work for honest pay!
4813,Bart,don't you know smoking stunts your growth?
2135,Bart,but it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
5292,Bart,nonhover.
5006,Bart,gotcha.
12684,Bart,i can't believe it... you've actually found a practical use for geometry.
9215,Bart,"...then zack skyped us, live-blogged our spelling bee, and friended us on facebook!"
188,Bart,"well, it is not going to happen, see?"
6019,Bart,"how 'bout judaism? when you turn thirteen, cha-ching."
6165,Bart,"boy, that's some fancy shootin'."
12787,Bart,what?
8417,Bart,why aren't you at your new job?
4422,Bart,bo-ring. i'll take you to a place that's really romantic.
1312,Bart,well... i've been thinking. you've been really great to me... but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more.
12528,Bart,and now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if i don't shape up.
8323,Bart,i can't take it anymore!
7449,Bart,how did dad get out of this snooze cruise?
11646,Bart,"i found a place that really wants to teach me, and i really want to learn."
9964,Bart,they dared me to see how many tv remotes i could stick in my mouth.
680,Bart,"oh, this sucks. c'mon snipers. where are you?"
9515,Bart,"then they should've called it the ""above-ground normal-road."""
7729,Bart,what? um... uh... i just shoplifted this bad boy. housewares never knew what hit 'em.
7954,Bart,"s'okay, buck! bad hop, bad hop!"
10202,Bart,i'm so sick of keys. they've brought nothing but good luck since i got them.
6978,Bart,no way!
5387,Bart,the play-doh factory...
8337,Bart,"dad, look, a corn maze!"
1377,Bart,"dad, i'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish."
12340,Bart,"nice to meet you, ma'am."
4372,Bart,"oh, you'd be surprised. he gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. c'mon, dad. we're playing capture the flag!"
3920,Bart,since when?
11398,Bart,"a little singing? if there's one thing he did not have to genetically enhance, it's his voice."
7270,Bart,"mayah quimby is my er ah, fathah. give me one million dollahs!"
948,Bart,what about the emmys?
5500,Bart,it's approaching the podium!
1059,Bart,cool.
10445,Bart,we don't need your website. we can make anything into guns.
7337,Bart,thinner... thinner... thinner... thinner... too thin.
4288,Bart,hello everybody. sparkle sparkle.
13009,Bart,all right! no line!
66,Bart,"milhouse, good to see you, pal. what's happening, man?"
4190,Bart,"so, wait a minute. this means i'm gonna be a failure?"
11323,Bart,i guess. who are you?
12319,Bart,"extra tentacles, please."
13026,Bart,i had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
11333,Bart,to this school? on purpose? even after springfield montessori opened across the street?
1255,Bart,"sorry, mom, the mob has spoken."
7893,Bart,you?
6624,Bart,i've got to get that hood ornament. no matter who owns it.
9437,Bart,poor krusty. he's become the lowest form of life -- a sidekick.
9272,Bart,or kick the crap out of you.
6318,Bart,dad...
5161,Bart,"'scuse me, brother faith. i gotta know, how did you really get the bucket off my dad's head?"
10516,Bart,"dammit, she knows! okay, how do we buy your silence?"
8961,Bart,i told you we should have left her with your mother!
1212,Bart,"i could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. go my pretties... kill, kill!"
11640,Bart,"hey pal, what are you in here for?"
10637,Bart,"hey, lis! at least you nerds are still geekin' it up. what could be sweeter than a vacation that never ends?"
8873,Bart,hold that thought. i'm getting a text.
2619,Bart,those shelbyville kids think they're so hot. but you know what? they're not.
7746,Bart,"mother, what are you doing?"
6635,Bart,i'm in.
3987,Bart,uh-oh.
699,Bart,yo.
10646,Bart,"i wasn't being selfish, i did it for you guys, too!"
1628,Bart,ewww... uhh.
9948,Bart,you sure none of you guys gave me this?
12317,Bart,"ahoy, this place bites."
9629,Bart,i want the window seat.
4866,Bart,how'd you like to go on a real boat trip?
4698,Bart,"wait, dad, look!"
434,Bart,"krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
5368,Bart,i'll say! i've got my own band! and a moped.
1784,Bart,and he taught me how to do this.
4615,Bart,"mmm... so you say this product is known as ""fudge?"""
207,Bart,yup.
12055,Bart,oh no.
10130,Bart,now do-se-do...

8254,Bart,"wow, the graphics are amazing. that ball almost seems real!"
12752,Bart,"hey, lis! lisa! it's me, bart!"
7967,Bart,that was fat tony!
9894,Bart,"well, boy, i guess this is it. we've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption ""who's walking who?"""
4984,Bart,you said a mouthful!
6707,Bart,"well, what do you know, cats eat flies."
12968,Bart,"...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?"
608,Bart,"hey homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"
10886,Bart,"the least common blood type is a--b, b--a, c--a.b., d--o. d'oh!"
5523,Bart,"don't give up, dad. maybe we can get the who to play here instead."
6308,Bart,sure is sunny... was the air always this fresh?... i'm just gonna hang out in this vent.
8870,Bart,shhh! i'm listening to financing terms for double-glazed windows.
12109,Bart,one more time.
6719,Bart,"hey, lazy horse! find us something cool to do."
2861,Bart,"quick gramma, hide!"
2435,Bart,"no, mom... wait. it's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny."
254,Bart,"homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
5777,Bart,i love-a you all!
11881,Bart,"an hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on."
12936,Bart,"no problemo, unky herb."
3320,Bart,"yeah, sure, we know him. that's mr. burns."
1180,Bart,i've gotta do something. hmmmm.
8140,Bart,what about brazil?
5199,Bart,"wow, you can do anything out here."
4829,Bart,"it wasn't easy, but i got all the grizzlies."
4632,Bart,are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
9571,Bart,the other fourth grade?! but they're so different from us. they have music on tuesdays!
11027,Bart,"lis, you saved us!"
11107,Bart,i lied so i could see zhenya.
12058,Bart,let's just say i paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
3763,Bart,"step back, mom! it's bart's turn now! / eat my shorts! don't have a cow!"
253,Bart,"joe's taxidermy. you snuff 'em, we stuff 'em."
12772,Bart,he made it!
8426,Bart,you're donny? pop-pop said that after he died you should give me ten bucks a week. starting now.
11882,Bart,oof!
8195,Bart,awesome!
12360,Bart,all the time.
11356,Bart,this hospital has another doctor?
3416,Bart,"think about it. i mean, what ""team"" was babe ruth on? who knows?"
9783,Bart,testing...
4319,Bart,"oooh, that's gotta hurt!"
1353,Bart,why are you saying that?
11997,Bart,"no, me!"
269,Bart,i don't have any.
5773,Bart,you got that right.
4811,Bart,jonah! you died the way you lived - inside a whale.
10737,Bart,"thanks, man."
3978,Bart,"dear santa. if you bring me lotsa good stuff, i promise not to do anything bad between now and when i wake up. amen."
5117,Bart,it's the goodwill truck!
7119,Bart,welcome to lecture number eight on the water balloon. yesterday i asked everyone to think of other liquids you could fill a balloon with.
1622,Bart,a human going!
9583,Bart,"dad, that is genius, but i need some advice--"
8807,Bart,i can't believe i lost.
10422,Bart,thanks.
10280,Bart,great. you can call her from the closet phone.
4990,Bart,"yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street."
6304,Bart,all you gotta do is play a prank on the principal.
8687,Bart,does that mean i can stop training to be a mexican wrestler?
5159,Bart,i have the power?
1723,Bart,"i know, i'll just do like lisa and escape into fantasy."
1208,Bart,"heh, heh, heh."
12574,Bart,mom and dad have been smooching again.
13108,Bart,i guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
8228,Bart,"oh, dark stanley would never dare attack a crowded, well-lit--"
11744,Bart,"homer, can't you sleep with mom?"
352,Bart,die don't.
8541,Bart,sounds boring.
6674,Bart,"bumblebee-man, mi treehouse es su bee- house... reverend, love the cassock... moleman, lookin' good!..."
10596,Bart,you're a bully?
10676,Bart,prank you! prank you very much!
4180,Bart,yeah! ha! ha! ha! / woo! woo! woo!
1202,Bart,what were their names?
4371,Bart,"yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. i pick my dad."
10993,Bart,why do you still have a thing for nelson?
5079,Bart,do all these people have to watch me?
3028,Bart,"no, mom, i can handle it. let's see... pay to the order of... lisa. one cent... and no cents. and now the old john hancock... here you go."
6062,Bart,whatever.
11714,Bart,that's lettuce caught in a spider's web.
3270,Bart,"you expect me to believe all this? if any of it was true, wouldn't i have a big, hideous scar..."
9390,Bart,i'm sorry. i guess having a little brother is more responsibility than i thought. especially 'cause i thought it'd be no responsibility at all.
10831,Bart,"hey, lisa's right. you're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog."
2691,Bart,...radioactive man!!!
4269,Bart,got any threes?
10128,Bart,backwards one...
7599,Bart,"mom, a religion isn't cool just because they've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties."
7046,Bart,but the bread's still dancing!
4670,Bart,scratching their big butts...
10192,Bart,"dad, the cake!"
8387,Bart,"lis, you have to release that water. it's the only way to short out the fan."
10301,Bart,who cares? i'll be president of hell by then.
10879,Bart,"no, no!"
7470,Bart,i'd rather follow the dog. i think he's up to something.
1743,Bart,"hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."
2205,Bart,but your father said...
5736,Bart,"hey, get me outta here! hey!"
10684,Bart,"""lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection."""
12304,Bart,"ah, baloney."
8908,Bart,this is my bedroom?!
95,Bart,"but i must. until this moment, i never knew why god put me on this earth, but now i know... to buy that comic book."
9796,Bart,"so which of these ""bored lames"" shall we play? taffyland?"
9636,Bart,"bart, i'm not thrilled either. but one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. want to help me with my ant farm?"
5858,Bart,"let's see, front door, back door, skinner's, flanders', your house... ah, lisa's bike."
5645,Bart,i'm tired of taking orders from g.i. jerk. i'm gonna tunnel outta here.
1460,Bart,"and you like snakes, don't you barry white?"
7350,Bart,"wow, all these people are gonna see dad's show."
6455,Bart,"oh, this is great stuff -- i can pad it out to ten pages. goodnight, grampa."
9475,Bart,"oh yeah? if you don't keep splashing the cash, i'm gonna tell mom that it's thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever."
12895,Bart,dad!
4472,Bart,booger.
10071,Bart,oh my god! the legends are true!
272,Bart,you're just putting that in because it's commercial.
2027,Bart,"traitors. go on and have your pool. i'm fine by myself, right here."
6087,Bart,"oh-ho, we are so there."
980,Bart,always thinking two moves ahead.
11798,Bart,"mom, lisa and i learned we could solve any problem through song. lisa, let's go write something that'll change dad's mind."
11828,Bart,ow! quit it.
11288,Bart,homer just pirated a movie. it's not the worst thing dad ever did. it's not even the worst kind of pirate dad's ever been.
4930,Bart,can't help ya.
7291,Bart,"i'm still a kid. and what do kids love? kid stuff, like this."
4523,Bart,"mom, you were right. nelson is bad news. can we go home?"
7848,Bart,and that's why i didn't have time to study for my geography test.
4547,Bart,excuse me. can you tell us what kind of birds these are? they hatched from eggs i found in a nest.
2561,Bart,"oh you bet, mom. ask me anything."
4206,Bart,you would know.
11592,Bart,"hm, i'm not feelin' it."
5399,Bart,"hey, what's all the screaming?"
60,Bart,"what's next, lis?"
8185,Bart,what?!
8506,Bart,from milhouse! i love him so much!
6075,Bart,"excuse me, but you don't sound as tough as you do in the movies."
6448,Bart,"what should i do, lord? give me a sign."
6240,Bart,"i'd know, mom."
147,Bart,"hi, mom."
4759,Bart,i think i read somewhere that cows like being killed.
9332,Bart,fine. i'll see what's on tv.
6837,Bart,"lis, your stupid present will only last a week. mine will sit in a closet for years."
7246,Bart,"nope, it's real -- check out the watermark."
11299,Bart,"that's because jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""it was me who sent you to hell."""
604,Bart,kool moe dee.
9407,Bart,i'm gonna take stuff from the lost and found!
7842,Bart,"but on the upside, i found some cave paintings and made them awesome."
8992,Bart,"jordan. that's on some map somewhere, right?"
8429,Bart,is that a real thing?
9353,Bart,"look, i want a baby brother, but i can't get my parents to do it."
10166,Bart,"if you think that makes me a better musher, you're wrong. wait a second..."
7707,Bart,i heard ol' neil put her down.
4022,Bart,springfield swings like a pendulum do!
1718,Bart,"i believe you, dad."
798,Bart,"sorry if i betrayed your trust, principal sucker."
6609,Bart,"hey dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight."
3996,Bart,"well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek..."
9800,Bart,yahtzu?
536,Bart,maybe it's for the best.
12862,Bart,oh.
10108,Bart,oh yeah? look.
11667,Bart,let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
12247,Bart,so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?
4534,Bart,"oh, yeah. hope you like poptarts."
10682,Bart,"hey lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at flesh-in-the-pan pizza, and wanted me to invite you."
3136,Bart,"one adult and two children, please."
4808,Bart,all right. it's giant slayin' time...
6732,Bart,except to all of america's problems.
2512,Bart,dogs always land on their feet.
6865,Bart,"dad, you blew it. you listened to lisa. and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience."
5751,Bart,"dear lisa. psych. psych, psych, psych. signed, super-psych."
3816,Bart,"excuse me, is this mad magazine?"
5804,Bart,uh-oh...
7320,Bart,it's goose!
4780,Bart,what are you doing?
1808,Bart,"no way, josé !"
154,Bart,"no! no, not the iodine! burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- yaaauuuggghhh!"
7052,Bart,why are your keys in my scrambled eggs?
4801,Bart,you killed my best friend.
2649,Bart,milhouse! milhouse! now what do i do?
5040,Bart,wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
8187,Bart,"look, darcy, i like you. i really do. it's just... i'm only ten years old."
3200,Bart,huh. the light must've burned out.
5492,Bart,"wow, a house made of gingerbread!"
8372,Bart,sweet. now i'm gonna need some wheels.
1558,Bart,"yes'm. dad, i know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can."
1841,Bart,nah. he doesn't want to learn and i don't want to teach him. we get along fine.
2082,Bart,"well, the important thing is that we survived."
2642,Bart,"uh... hey, look! someone's attractive cousin."
3164,Bart,"lisa, i really need your help, so i'm gonna let you in on a secret. there's no such thing."
723,Bart,oh yeah.
218,Bart,"eh, yeah, hello, is mike there? last name, rotch."
1514,Bart,yeah!
1330,Bart,yeah.
11040,Bart,"he's right, these underwater speakers are amazing!"
1562,Bart,"ew! gross! it's probably diseased or something. here, maggie."
7909,Bart,sweet.
10515,Bart,"no, no, i'm too concerned with unemployment."
1064,Bart,"zabar, kresge, caldor, walmart!"
9360,Bart,what about what i want? i'd help you take care of him.
706,Bart,"one months detention... she'll pay for this. yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a malibu stacy head down here."
10171,Bart,really? why?
777,Bart,go on.
11450,Bart,we outlaws have to stick together.
10658,Bart,this is a happy ending?
11226,Bart,aooga!
11694,Bart,there he is.
635,Bart,"oh, brotherrr."
11349,Bart,is a falcon's training leash called a creance? yes!
11410,Bart,ay carumba.
3769,Bart,testing...
8005,Bart,"i wanna thank everyone for this special night. jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
6007,Bart,"hey lis, is dad's credit card number 5784365343410709?"
0,Bart,"thanks, dude."
6307,Bart,"good going, lis. and it sure is great to be out of that bubble."
8344,Bart,"please, can he?"
3565,Bart,"yeah, ""go to bread."""
3595,Bart,"whoa, bonanza! let's load it up before the rats regroup."
369,Bart,no.
11652,Bart,"sayonara, sucker!"
744,Bart,wow! how many home runs you gonna hit with that?
5210,Bart,he's a diving horse. maybe he could dive for pearls.
12829,Bart,"hey, cool. i'm dead."
11726,Bart,how 'bout that one?
5983,Bart,my dad's always yelling that whitey's keepin' him down.
876,Bart,polly wolly doodle.
11807,Bart,"god doesn't hear my prayers. if he did, i'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper."
12397,Bart,aye carumba!
13028,Bart,waaaaaaaah!
10859,Bart,"hey, don't blame me -- i didn't even take the test."
2419,Bart,i can handle that. i'm an expert at phony apologies.
10349,Bart,we ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
3619,Bart,i don't know. i don't think it's important.
10983,Bart,it's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.
4727,Bart,"mom, to your left. he's letting you in. go!"
11342,Bart,"i met this kid. a little older, kind of strange. i don't think other people get him, but i just wanna hang out with him all the time."
7988,Bart,xavier cugat!
854,Bart,surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except aunt selma.
6077,Bart,"oh, it's okay. my bed is stuffed with hay."
7399,Bart,i don't think we'll be hearing from him again.
4028,Bart,but i can't go out dressed like this! what if someone sees me?
11156,Bart,"yep, that's me. when she's asleep i'm in control."
6263,Bart,"this little trap is gonna make my dad angrier than he's ever been. in the meantime, i gotta tell those internet guys to hold tight."
4179,Bart,ha! ha! ha! hee! hee!/ woo hoo! ha! ha! / i didn't think it was gonna fall over. ha! ha!
10929,Bart,good idea. i can chuck eggs at the other couples.
993,Bart,"my chunky brothers, gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom!"
3597,Bart,dad! knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
4466,Bart,"top of the world, ma!"
9768,Bart,we're not losers. last year we finished six and five.
3848,Bart,"d, e... um... line?"
12806,Bart,"hey, what gives?"
10884,Bart,uh... b?
4490,Bart,one stinkin' letter? why'd you make us gather 'round like that?
2996,Bart,"did your secret service goons ever whack anybody, george?"
2609,Bart,"hey, milhouse. how's the lemonade business?"
4656,Bart,"throw hot wax on him, dad!"
5734,Bart,with pleasure.
731,Bart,i can't help but feel partly responsible.
2176,Bart,huh?
4404,Bart,ta-da!
5748,Bart,he thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. but it was the perfect place to shoot him.
7267,Bart,"c'mon, boy. take your pill."
12673,Bart,right. i am a pawn.

3101,Bart,"so, you don't work on a contingency basis?"
1961,Bart,i can't.
2185,Bart,"is it my hair? my overbite? the fact that i've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"
7448,Bart,"oh yeah, it's great. why don't we top it off by reading to old people?"
2639,Bart,"that's right. the stranger who walks amongst you is me, bart simpson!"
3194,Bart,"i can't believe you, grampa. the sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like burns! you gotta get that treasure! you gotta do it for ox and asa and griff and burnsie... well, not so much burnsie."

1858,Bart,"stampy, quick! pull him out!"
2846,Bart,"ah, dad? towel rack...?"
3455,Bart,"mo-om, you can hug me when i'm asleep."
9495,Bart,"principal skinner?! this is bogus, man. you know the rules: two letters and a conference before i get a home visit."
12545,Bart,"great, martin. now, the big test is tomorrow and i haven't even started to study..."
12949,Bart,i thought your car was really cool.
5504,Bart,"well boy, looks like you've got yourself a roommate."
12551,Bart,"oh? no, no."
7053,Bart,"cool, guns."
11357,Bart,so they're transferring him to another hospital.
8822,Bart,nope... nope... nope...
11161,Bart,"well, wherever i am, it's gotta be an improvement."
3122,Bart,well... i wasn't the one who solved the problem and neither was lisa. there's something unsettling about that.
8108,Bart,'cause my chest is cold and my arms aren't.
7027,Bart,but they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
12452,Bart,not if i can help it.
1792,Bart,"wendy windbag? ""ugly doris""? ""hortense: the mule-faced doll""?"
4612,Bart,"no, really. you're lazy and self-righteous..."
1263,Bart,yee-hawww!

2524,Bart,oww! my bones are so brittle. but i always drink plenty of... malk?
12934,Bart,"i'm the little hell-raiser, sir."
10073,Bart,"whoa, mama."
2168,Bart,"hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. let's kill it."
8656,Bart,but...
9893,Bart,what about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
4733,Bart,"c'mon, mom, just cut across the field."
11209,Bart,okay. you got my attention.
8885,Bart,night is scary...
12166,Bart,"you're right, mom. i'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing."
4602,Bart,there goes my turn.
5635,Bart,"dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth."
5163,Bart,i figure i'll go for the life of sin followed by the presto-chango deathbed repentance.
7774,Bart,"krusty, you gotta help us."
5180,Bart,tes-ti-fy! / tes-ti-fy!
1735,Bart,i'm bart simpson. i saved you from jail.

4389,Bart,"oh, dad's gonna die and it's all my fault! i really need a good talkin' to."
4239,Bart,what's that weird key for?
12928,Bart,not one word.
9543,Bart,the violence really relaxes me.
10096,Bart,stop it!
6396,Bart,don't worry. krusty always lands on his feet.
7815,Bart,"dad, i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer."
8919,Bart,awesome!
2315,Bart,"no offense, homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
6126,Bart,and here's a new four-legged friend for me. hiya boy. haven't seen you around here before.
2193,Bart,that'll hold me. at least 'til i get my hands on some kind of explosives.
4552,Bart,"everyone thinks they're monsters, but i raised them and i love them. i know that's hard to understand."
3000,Bart,where'd you get those pajamas?
5878,Bart,are you nuts?
6408,Bart,the doorman died.
5864,Bart,uh-oh.
3221,Bart,"dad, you cannot wear that! that's a rastafarian hat!"
1917,Bart,"well, it was good to see you."
5503,Bart,"whoa, a badger! sorry man, you can't crash here. c'mon, let's go."
9795,Bart,it's a game. we're not hurtin' anybody.
9361,Bart,"oh my god, the hamsters!"

1747,Bart,"wow, being in show business is like a dream. we're really lucky, aren't we?"
12768,Bart,truckasaurous!

9202,Bart,dr. hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--
2872,Bart,target sighted. launching air-to-nerd missile!
6202,Bart,"crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme..."
6546,Bart,"boy, it's really empty in here."

12633,Bart,"oh, wow -- there's flash bailor! i gotta get his autograph! he used to be a star!"
573,Bart,"""the inventor i admire"", by bart simpson. the inventor i admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. he's my father, homer simpson, creator of... the ""flaming homer""!"
92,Bart,wow. radioactive man number one.
2723,Bart,"so, milhouse, it must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour comin' back to school, huh."
4521,Bart,ow! what are you doing?
1449,Bart,"is that story true, grampa?"
4456,Bart,"uh, nothing."
9469,Bart,"look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. you work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
5958,Bart,mo-om!
12749,Bart,"my wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... i've hit the jackpot!"

6596,Bart,"aw, all the good ones. hmm, i've never even heard of number nine."
11234,Bart,"to avoid temptation, i'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. i buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard."
9490,Bart,"hey milhouse, want a turn pulling my rickshaw?"
12614,Bart,anything!
3155,Bart,we're on the home stretch!
3427,Bart,"did you hear that, lis? dad's gonna be just fine."
2611,Bart,"hey, stop talking bad about my town, man."
8585,Bart,why did you take the rap for me?
8840,Bart,"so i can get a dollar for every ball i find?! then if a cell phone costs one hundred dollars, how many balls do i need?"
11847,Bart,"ah, come on dad, this can be the miracle that saves the simpsons' christmas. if tv has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at christmas. it happened to tiny tim, it happened to charlie brown, it happened to the smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us."
7639,Bart,i'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
9682,Bart,they're doing it!
8186,Bart,"no, i'm not, but--"

4453,Bart,"hey, dad, i've been thinking. what if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?"
7425,Bart,no... you don't mean...
8559,Bart,c'mon. more turbulent than now?
6439,Bart,i don't know how we ever had fun without him.
5544,Bart,"well, maybe i should."
10057,Bart,i am the bart.
8058,Bart,how come i can't join the army but lisa gets to be in peta?
5200,Bart,"hey, coast guard! try and stop us now, you lousy americans!"
9399,Bart,are you gonna turn us in?
6003,Bart,who cares?
7392,Bart,"that's a very noble sentiment, lisa. but for once in your life, can't you just be cool?"
28,Bart,"well, you got that right. thanks for your vote, girls."
3534,Bart,all the best bands are affiliated with satan.
10276,Bart,"well, dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe i should tell you..."

3274,Bart,but you'll kill both of us!
6928,Bart,sure he's tough. but he's never come up against a wooden mallet!
5393,Bart,"you did it, dad!"
2915,Bart,"then may i please rent it, please?"
7014,Bart,"just because i have milhouse back, doesn't mean i haven't learned a few things about being a brother."
12887,Bart,hell.
11075,Bart,"grampa, i made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
5847,Bart,"hey, lis, check it out."
842,Bart,that sideshow bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
4124,Bart,"okay, now throw the vine back!"
8257,Bart,ping!
8128,Bart,"hey, thanks for saving me, man."
140,Bart,"no, thanks."
9494,Bart,"yeah, like the time you said dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?"
11102,Bart,"if i got you all these students, shouldn't you be grateful?"

8791,Bart,"okay, comforting, comforting... uh dad, whenever i would hang out with grandma, she would always ask me about you. and i'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad."

4781,Bart,huh?
3021,Bart,"i'm sorry, mom. i'll behave."
7698,Bart,but what will junkies do drugs under?
1381,Bart,i've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? he must have a weakness.
11919,Bart,the what?
10129,Bart,diagonal two...
12932,Bart,"bastard / bastard, bastard!"
1744,Bart,"well that'll always be the dream, but for now i got a job in the show business. from now on i'll be helping krusty the clown after school."
1127,Bart,can't complain.
7138,Bart,first let's slap on some band-aids so they feel really bad for ditching us.
5410,Bart,oh.
4905,Bart,and i think i've finally found what i was put on this earth to do...
2053,Bart,"no, lisa, don't go upstairs. you'll be trapped!"
383,Bart,reverend lovejoy! you've... you've come to comfort me?
7180,Bart,karaté!
5921,Bart,not me...
9984,Bart,"great, baby. get me some more tokens."
3501,Bart,how'd you know that thing would work?
2892,Bart,"maggie can be maggina, her spunky sidekick."
534,Bart,"well, as three-time soapbox derby champ ronnie beck says, ""poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
2215,Bart,just give me two minutes.
5568,Bart,ow!
4277,Bart,they're getting ready to throw the switch!
8215,Bart,int. lakeside mansion - kitchen - present - later
3810,Bart,"look, it's zz top! you guys rock!"
3571,Bart,oooh -- oh -- so close!
202,Bart,oh.
2965,Bart,huh.
11933,Bart,"well, i could pretend i'm a regular dumb kid. you know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. you know, see what makes them tick."
2626,Bart,"hey, milhouse -- get your invasion supplies and let's go!"
12994,Bart,"hey, didn't anybody notice this place sucks?"
4144,Bart,"oh, this sucks. i am outta here."
8894,Bart,i thought it was fifty.
10149,Bart,i was invited to that party!
9612,Bart,"yeah, thanks a lot, flanders."
3360,Bart,"oh, there's a way, mom..."
4211,Bart,stop sayin' that!
11655,Bart,shhh!
10035,Bart,i... i don't want to talk about it.
1670,Bart,seems like everywhere i look people are enjoying knives.
10915,Bart,not at all.
9966,Bart,and i bet it has something to do with this scar.
8702,Bart,i hate the beanbag store. the clerks are always shouting in hebrew on their cell phones.
1945,Bart,my mom's number is on there if you want to check up on me.
11983,Bart,"oh, yeah?"
6450,Bart,"ooh, algebra... i'll just do a few equations. no! no more distractions!"
11445,Bart,ay carumba!
10161,Bart,"that's a lot of zeros! you know, all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty. can we go home now?"
12998,Bart,choose your corncob! en garde!
5945,Bart,"mom, you cut the tether."
8202,Bart,utah karate!
12431,Bart,"well, maybe. but, get this, krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the springfield review of books."
9762,Bart,how'd you like to kiss my ass?
2956,Bart,"okay, okay, i won't bug milhouse... but... well, mrs. van houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb, but can i hang out with you while you do mom stuff?"
687,Bart,where's my lucky red cap?
3182,Bart,"well, i'm sure you'll make up something. maybe you just need more of my classmates around."
6836,Bart,an elephant's butt?
3705,Bart,you didn't crucify him?
1498,Bart,"hey, red hot chili peppers. would you guys like to appear on a krusty the klown special?"
1560,Bart,"hey, apu, this bag of ice has a head in it."
6948,Bart,he'll never read it.
12411,Bart,so?
6676,Bart,"dad, five minutes ago you hated him."
9582,Bart,"anyway, i'm really hoping you could... dad?"
6942,Bart,"well, you did disappear a lot, but i have gone whole summers without seeing you."
10008,Bart,"i did it! i got an ""a""!"
11757,Bart,you're in the top hundred.
10766,Bart,i don't know. dork farm? who cares?
11106,Bart,i'm sorry! i was faking it!
6466,Bart,"these stink lines stand for dedication, caring, and for letting me drink coffee in class. way to go, edna!"
4480,Bart,so?
3080,Bart,"oh, forget this. i'm outta here."
9658,Bart,carrot cake?!
8146,Bart,in about two seconds.
8289,Bart,shhh.
6314,Bart,"look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... they're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. please can i throw one little..."
5102,Bart,deal!
633,Bart,mama! mama!
4856,Bart,they cut out the best word!
2201,Bart,"sorry, i have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. speaking of charming, watching fox last night, i heard a rather amusing story... this character named martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
12539,Bart,study area?
4293,Bart,i don't believe this! everyone's got an earring!
8917,Bart,"mcmansion, mcmansion..."
11568,Bart,"...saw everything you did! milhouse is the hero! take it from me, the boy who's lied throughout!"
2958,Bart,oh. and who is warren burke?
9347,Bart,"trick 'em, i like it. but how?"
6869,Bart,can we get our big christmas tree now?
12680,Bart,i'll bet.
5388,Bart,"c'mon, springfield. sparkle for me, baby. that's it..."
5836,Bart,which way should we go?
11091,Bart,let me try.
11793,Bart,and they shut down the thinkhole...
11361,Bart,diggs isn't cuckoo!
10895,Bart,"oh, i see. you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night, rolls over, and crushes mom."
9891,Bart,"see? he's a questionable character! he used to hang around racetracks, you know!"
7577,Bart,"i'm bart simpson, ay carumba, do the bartman, etcetera, etcetera."
3263,Bart,i showed it to your friends again before we left.
12973,Bart,uh... take a walk!
4732,Bart,all right.
5565,Bart,"mercury, venus, earth, mars..."
9605,Bart,i want you to act the same way two days in a row! augggh! i am not gonna let you hurt me anymore.
7055,Bart,bull-honky.
204,Bart,"yeah, mom. we got hosed!"
4975,Bart,wow. praise from caesar.
7989,Bart,not smoking reefer!
10021,Bart,you're gonna love meeting my friends.
11122,Bart,mom! lisa made me break a lamp!
11914,Bart,"""toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor / please use the cuspidor, that's what it's for."""
2332,Bart,maybe we should be listening to him now.
6931,Bart,uh-oh. his weak spot is now his strongest point.
2239,Bart,"jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
2264,Bart,because - you - stink - at - sports...
10593,Bart,then go back to jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
3665,Bart,twelve hundred bucks?! i better just get one.
11222,Bart,i bet by the end of the night you're gonna look pretty good.
10843,Bart,"dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?"
1083,Bart,"gee, maybe they mean it this time. from now on i guess i'd better straighten up and fly..."
2423,Bart,"sorry, girl. i don't wanna get in any more trouble down here."
2487,Bart,my strobe light!
5376,Bart,"okay, mom. we're rolling."
9209,Bart,you look tired. maybe you need some more coffee.
5907,Bart,"hey, how 'bout 007?!"
8194,Bart,utah? home of america's most powerful weirdoes?
12373,Bart,"sorry, man. be my guest."
6483,Bart,it's not for me. i'm not a girl like you.
412,Bart,ha ha! you're losing.
8343,Bart,"santa's little helper would be an awesome police dog! can he, dad? can he?"
10026,Bart,"masters, i can explain."
2251,Bart,"all right, snow day! no school tomorrow!"
2621,Bart,we gotta get that tree back!
12226,Bart,you do?
10282,Bart,so immature.
1892,Bart,that's them all right. i can't believe it. i guess you're the only one i can trust...
10300,Bart,"oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee?"
1727,Bart,any popped eyeballs?
10283,Bart,"yo, teachwads! the brotherhood of the spectacles has taken over the school!"
5484,Bart,ow!
3234,Bart,"hi, becky. thanks for comin' out."
2744,Bart,milhouse!
5172,Bart,but church can be fun.
7454,Bart,"i see. you were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? that's my half-assed dad!"
1599,Bart,we're all vampires.
3246,Bart,"oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
8415,Bart,dad?
6932,Bart,that moan sounded almost human.
4183,Bart,"pretty neat, huh?"
2069,Bart,whoa!
1487,Bart,"well, it's... ah, you wouldn't be interested. it's too low brow."
11597,Bart,no.
5124,Bart,can i go to the bathroom?
11392,Bart,"absolutely. we're talking about lisa, right?"
5467,Bart,"fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man."
3143,Bart,he sure did.
10456,Bart,"milhouse! what do i have to do, besides changing in any way, to get you to forgive me?"
6427,Bart,"hey, you should see how much trouble dad's having shaving with a straight razor."
7347,Bart,the running back for the san antonio cow skulls?!
1448,Bart,i didn't do it.
10064,Bart,"my lame-o sister, lisa."
5001,Bart,"nope, looks normal... wait a minute."
523,Bart,i can make her. just give me five minutes alone with her.
2415,Bart,mr. simpson... blah blah... misrepresentation over telephone... yadda yadda... sincerely... some australian jerk.
3030,Bart,no need. i'm going to get krusty's autograph the easy way.
2633,Bart,"aw. it's no use, milhouse. if we're gonna find that lemon tree, i've got to go undercover. what i need is a new face."
1471,Bart,who's gonna change maggie?
6786,Bart,"aww. so, why are you back in town?"
6511,Bart,the cowgirls versus the she-gles. no love lost there.
2306,Bart,"did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?"
291,Bart,"well, okay, which one do you want?"
5402,Bart,"dad, look out!"
11305,Bart,"no. no valentine for you, nelson."
2127,Bart,dad?
2115,Bart,"yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
10036,Bart,can we close the door?
11056,Bart,"five seconds to slip-off. and four, three--"
1545,Bart,college? barber or clown?
2789,Bart,who?
1847,Bart,"dad, you can't do this. stampy is my friend."
599,Bart,"you're a machine, homer."
1290,Bart,chicken?
3736,Bart,lisa! dad! c'mere quick! there is something that you won't believe!
9943,Bart,"it's agreed -- no biting, no throwing rocks, no face farts, flying face farts, backdoor haircuts, 'nad noogies, moist michaels, and absolutely no ""brazilian hardwood."""
12819,Bart,"oop, i guess i'll just go and watch some cartoons."
8466,Bart,trick-or-treat! lick my feet! your head smells like pig-butt meat!
4531,Bart,"hi, little eggs. i'm not sure how to tell you this, but... y-your mom was involved in an incident. mistakes were made. by me. but don't worry, i'll take care of you."
4033,Bart,"work was hard, so we quit."
7767,Bart,why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
7615,Bart,can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?
11513,Bart,"hey, this is all your fault."
11578,Bart,well no... but he's not a rabbi. more of a flabbi.
1699,Bart,what is this place?
11786,Bart,"whoa. thinking back, i'm kinda surprised mom and dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom."
1382,Bart,beer! beer is the cheese. but how to use it...
12817,Bart,"oh, oh, baby!"
12776,Bart,oof!
3639,Bart,"i'm outta here. skinny, krabby, catch ya later."
197,Bart,allergies.
3344,Bart,he's tough but fair. i'll start sorting these bras.
12565,Bart,"who am i kidding? i really am a failure. oh, now i know how george washington felt when he surrendered fort necessity to the french in 1754..."
5850,Bart,and it sounds like he has big news!
3897,Bart,"and the next marksman is... william tell, jr.!"
9096,Bart,so you and mom aren't married? does that mean i'm a bastard?
4767,Bart,don't you have work?
1615,Bart,dad. dad! you really want to get rid of this trampoline?
8376,Bart,"i've got a man down! well, not a man. a very special boy."
5984,Bart,"if it happens, it happens."
1168,Bart,what happened?
9713,Bart,we need a third maid. maybe someone will step in and help.
12395,Bart,"comedy, thy name is krusty."
3331,Bart,"dad, i think i need some fresh air. can i go to the park?"
5412,Bart,"i'm in tantrum position. t-minus five... four... three... remembering dead cat for real tears, and..."
12238,Bart,so... watch me hit him right between the eyes.
10288,Bart,"oh my god. milhouse, did you take your nap?"
4915,Bart,"pound him, dad!"
10279,Bart,taking over the school. with all the kids inside!
12964,Bart,we never had a family meeting before.
9418,Bart,put the rope in your teeth!
7874,Bart,what's a macgyver and why does it have a convention?
3966,Bart,not in my damn house.
5217,Bart,"he's the bad boy of racing. he's got attitude and bad-itude, so show him some latitude and you'll win his gratitude. only in america!"
136,Bart,say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. how about a couple on the house?
4076,Bart,"c'mon, dad! the team's arriving!"
5152,Bart,"tonight we're gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at club med, and scare the normals."
1969,Bart,"mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but i know he's innocent?"
9403,Bart,don't worry. me and charlie have one thing you'll never have.
2402,Bart,"we understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not."
6773,Bart,what we need is a scapegoat.
7072,Bart,that's my doll!
2680,Bart,who wants chocolate ice cream?
3381,Bart,"uh, i wouldn't take it down if i were you. it's a load-bearing poster."
12408,Bart,"he's innocent, i tell you. krusty would never do something like that. ah come on dad, you gotta listen to me."
363,Bart,"i was lookin' for those. thanks, doll."
9404,Bart,"point and shoot, bro. point and shoot."
12537,Bart,perhaps another demonstration.
2450,Bart,"i don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
5965,Bart,i'm a latchkey kid.
2692,Bart,"thank you, thank you, thank you. it's all in the delivery. ...now is the winter of our discontent..."
8933,Bart,oh yeah? well what's up with your brother and sister?
2192,Bart,there is just no pleasing a girl like that. all that unnecessary behaving... i'm all tensed through the chestal area. i need relief.
194,Bart,we worked so hard and now it's all gone... we ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
8948,Bart,uh... this trail is for experienced skiers.
9531,Bart,focused...
1215,Bart,"hey, homer. this house sucks."
3374,Bart,"um, i don't think you want to look in there, sir."
4013,Bart,head her off at the stairs!
9963,Bart,hey.
7978,Bart,uh-oh.
11862,Bart,i'll pay! how much?
1444,Bart,what's in it?
5008,Bart,it's xena! she's been kidnapped! come on!
2211,Bart,why?
12562,Bart,"oh no, i can't believe it."
7940,Bart,gotta go.
10251,Bart,"i'd act like i'm interested, but inside i'd be bored."
7808,Bart,"c'mon, dad, we got a long way to go. you can't stay mad at me the whole time."
2477,Bart,"hi, mom. aw, that's great news about lisa. well listen, i'd better get to get back to work."
10727,Bart,huh. didn't know they still ran those trains.
1265,Bart,"yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
12051,Bart,"look, everybody. i would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. i'm not saying i'm not a hero. i'm just saying that i fear for my safety."
265,Bart,"hey, looney tunes, this is what michael jackson looks like. you look like a big fat mental patient."
7926,Bart,i can't believe you remembered me through milhouse. he's not even my best friend.
1107,Bart,"i'm not licked yet. i can entertain myself. no matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
702,Bart,i didn't do it.
1818,Bart,"amen, ernie."
8007,Bart,"lis, you poured your heart into rescuing society's most vulnerable critters: animals. so i want all the money we've raised tonight to go to building... the lisa simpson home for abandoned animals!"
513,Bart,"grampa, if you wanna go right..."
6570,Bart,that's better.
647,Bart,my name is timmy o'toole. i just turned ten years old.
9394,Bart,"sorry dude, i didn't see you."
672,Bart,"fine, get it. lets go."
3841,Bart,b-i- -o
10297,Bart,yeah!
2277,Bart,"if you get hit, it's your own fault."
11449,Bart,i saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of mount springfield.
6798,Bart,"lis, skinner is using you. like a pawn on his unholy chess set."
1710,Bart,dad! we've been robbed!
5115,Bart,cloning is a troubling issue.
12613,Bart,you know what would have been scarier than nothing?
6296,Bart,i think this soup's a little hot.
11823,Bart,"one ""mother"", please."
9185,Bart,"que pasa, ladies?"
13129,Bart,"hey, that rundown old house looks familiar! that's where doc frink used to live!"
892,Bart,what's on?
5857,Bart,you take my sister's bike.
12108,Bart,sound off!
2569,Bart,"look, my stomach really hurts."
3727,Bart,"come on, boy, let's go home and have some fun. that cat's been strutting around like she owns the place..."
12267,Bart,'cause i wanted some really bad kids to like me. somehow i got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world.
4450,Bart,"when you want grease, go to the source: good old krusty burger."
12808,Bart,"but, dad, you'll never make it."
7538,Bart,i think i puked up all of my meanness.
12206,Bart,"no, dad. this whole thing was my fault. you run along."
4861,Bart,"okay, she's gone. let's break out of here and have some fun!"
1877,Bart,"hey, wait! how can you be here when your show's on live?"
6623,Bart,every car's been harvested!
9771,Bart,also wrong.
12751,Bart,"touchdown, simpson! the boy nobody wanted just won the superbowl!!!"
3488,Bart,anything slim!
10477,Bart,"he's still inside-in, folks! and just to prove it:"
435,Bart,"yeah, just relax and be yourself."
9675,Bart,medical waste!
8547,Bart,hot! hot! hot!
8516,Bart,"all right, i get it."
407,Bart,i had a fight with milhouse.
8010,Bart,what's going on here? am i destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? what does this button do? now my ship is pooping more triangles!
6139,Bart,keep him away from me.
12487,Bart,"yes, ma'am."
8107,Bart,"whoa, bart simpson is nobody's sidekick."
9041,Bart,what are you doing?
7721,Bart,"sorry, milhouse, i've got plans."
6016,Bart,still lookin' for a new faith?
10898,Bart,"wow, a man's stomach can be flat?"
4008,Bart,i accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. i'm really sorry.
3625,Bart,but... but i wasn't...
10053,Bart,what did they think?
10076,Bart,trying to get out of here before grampa wakes up.
10439,Bart,hop on!
3253,Bart,it's the principle. she's gotta learn!
4428,Bart,"so you see, there's treasure everywhere."
6742,Bart,you thieving hussy!
3212,Bart,"hey, whatcha doin -- studyin'?"
7023,Bart,"welcome to ""the others."""
7543,Bart,"hell, i'll even go shoe shopping."
9857,Bart,"this is too weird, man."
645,Bart,sucker.
13133,Bart,nooooo!!!!!
6248,Bart,"maybe angry dad needs a sidekick -- ""know-it-all sister""."
11065,Bart,"there, there, you'll be fine. i'll take care of everything you need."
6489,Bart,there is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.
6838,Bart,"oh look, jaclyn smith has her own line of axe heads!"
2721,Bart,"but milhouse! they haven't cured anything. heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. every last one of them. want results? you have to go to the schwarzeneggers, the stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the van dammes."
9533,Bart,i tried really hard to stop you from finding out. does that help?
13007,Bart,"thanks, dad."
4085,Bart,does anyone here like food?
10789,Bart,did you give the money back to the people who lost it?
2420,Bart,i'm sorry.
4235,Bart,"hmmm. wow! dad's been in jail six times. aw, and mom's only been in twice."
4843,Bart,"the fireworks, candy and puppy dog store?!"
518,Bart,busted!
2030,Bart,i swear i don't know where the bombs are! only the miners know that! maybe this will loosen your tongue! no! blah!!
5711,Bart,that's just his shopping list.
8759,Bart,"goodbye, lou. i'll never forget you."
10796,Bart,but i will not be sharing my mini-fridge with homer.
3002,Bart,"hey, where's your candy?"
11895,Bart,"oh, no. ties."
1171,Bart,how can i get her to notice me?
3251,Bart,"they're my friends, rightfully. she only got them by copying me!"
8569,Bart,fine. we'll divide the car into your side and my side. my leg is the barrier.
1429,Bart,do we have a deal?
11814,Bart,"yeah, we are grown up."
12278,Bart,hep! hep! lisa! my ungue is stuck in the eater. hep-hep!
3472,Bart,"all right, everybody got their ticket? then get ready for today's super-barto jackpot drawing!"
11802,Bart,i refuse to accept it!
12348,Bart,what have we here?
2684,Bart,"the similarities are subtle, but many. for example, radioactive man has his famous catchphrase ""up and atom"" - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun..."
7276,Bart,i'm using your unfinished novel!
11550,Bart,i suck?! you suck!
1852,Bart,he's gone forever.
8579,Bart,oh fine.
2011,Bart,"homer, my hat goes off to you."

4125,Bart,"hey, look at his tusk!"
10777,Bart,"lisa's going somewhere after school two days a week. and all we have are boxing wizards. if we're gonna find out what lisa's up to, i'll need the help of all her old boyfriends."
5981,Bart,what's stopping you?
12378,Bart,sorry.
2505,Bart,"yeah, they ate all my socks! i have to wear lisa's to school today!"
11497,Bart,"i admit, i did make a voodoo doll of mrs. trunch. but i just asked for a stomach ache, not a baby!"
7406,Bart,"no, cash."
7742,Bart,you know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. some of the little kids are bringing their parents. do you wanna go?
6683,Bart,"poor santa's little helper, he's overworked."
571,Bart,ow! what was that for?
8214,Bart,"no, boy! up, up, up!"
10555,Bart,"man, homer, you've always been a loser."

10519,Bart,"thanks, milhouse. we make a great team."
689,Bart,"i'm scared, lisa."
6775,Bart,jealous much?
3955,Bart,but we didn't enter any police raffle.

2975,Bart,i'll say god.
1708,Bart,"pipe down, sister. i've gotta book a new act for tonight. turns out that liza minelli impersonator was really liza minelli."

10122,Bart,i don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you! not unless george lucas needs another death star!
2919,Bart,"hmmm. maybe if i stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
3128,Bart,this play has everything!
12387,Bart,mon sauveteur! vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur!
5444,Bart,"hey, it'll be easy. you've still got most of the stuff from apu's wedding back there."
1417,Bart,"eh, too predictable. the way i see it, instead of shampoo itchy covers scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
12627,Bart,uh oh.
6443,Bart,sorry.
7389,Bart,"people, please. the only way lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove i was at that rap show. and i know just where she can find that someone. let's go cover our asses!"
3792,Bart,"i dunno. i was just looking at my shoelaces. look, the point is, you're going to make it, lis. and i'm going to stick by you."

4231,Bart,"maybe later. come on, ralph -- your dad's a cop. there must be some cool stuff around here. bullets, dead body photos, what have you."

938,Bart,"oh, come on, i've seen you cry a million times. you cry when you scrape your knee. you cry when they're out of chocolate milk. you cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
12233,Bart,"three jumbo cherry squishees and one double jumbo original flavor, sir."
5969,Bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
3484,Bart,"gonna what, homer?"

10525,Bart,"well, if it's in a gallery, how is it street art?"
2418,Bart,yes'm.
15,Bart,"man, you are full of surprises."
10651,Bart,stupid nelson! i hate that guy.
3982,Bart,how sweet it is!
3715,Bart,i can't promise i'll try. but i'll try to try.
4655,Bart,crap rock?
9562,Bart,"aww, you guys are the meanest parents ever. thank you."
5050,Bart,i'll say. i learned the true meaning of columbus day.
10136,Bart,"dammit, a pop quiz!"
10717,Bart,but don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?
6350,Bart,"wait a minute, i saw this one."
7033,Bart,"yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed."
6256,Bart,so what do you want to do with it?
11512,Bart,"look, fat tony. i don't know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people. horses? that's crazy talk!"
5104,Bart,it's always a party with funzo!
10692,Bart,geek leak!
3917,Bart,"but, coach?"
10217,Bart,you shouldn't suffer for my bad deed. it should just go unpunished forever.
4758,Bart,huh?
1655,Bart,"boy, a man on a squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things."
12639,Bart,what a lame-o!
2553,Bart,why isn't my mom stopping this?
7821,Bart,i guess.
583,Bart,what are we going to spend it on?
2852,Bart,and i think it's ironic that for once dad's butt prevented the release of toxic ga--
9231,Bart,"hey... ""just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
5789,Bart,i saw you last night at the spelling bee...
10700,Bart,is that the only reason?
2128,Bart,"yeah. there's just no way to resist it, is there?"
9252,Bart,"listen... i was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
10981,Bart,mine's full of hand mirrors.
6269,Bart,"yeah, but at least now that my show's cancelled, i don't need material, so there's no need to lure my dad into the trap i set up for him. the trap!"
8217,Bart,"no lunch for me...unless i ""scare"" one up."
3898,Bart,i certainly am.
1955,Bart,"ah, that's gotta hoit!"
5420,Bart,i've got a better place.
3082,Bart,"show some respect, man! that ""no talent"" created itchy and scratchy."
8169,Bart,"no, to drive."
8420,Bart,every place has such a long line.
3340,Bart,"oh, i can't believe i gotta spend all my free time dustin' doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch..."
8818,Bart,slide in the eighteen sixty-three confederate half-dime... and every slot is full.
8271,Bart,who knew guys in brown shirts could cause so much trouble.
8157,Bart,holy hannah! i've got more muscles than a new england clambake. now all i need is a superhero name.
11495,Bart,"sorry, but i don't think we'll be seeing much of trunch today."
4323,Bart,"all right, i'll read one comic just to get me rollin'. ""archie."" ""hey, jughead, didja hear, the supreme court reversed..."""
1753,Bart,show business sucks. i'm outta here.
6373,Bart,"ha-ha, they left without you."
516,Bart,"grampa, you're the spaceship, not the..."
9720,Bart,"aww, the little guy can't get out of the pumpkin. there must be something here!"
12266,Bart,"mom, dad."
12580,Bart,"i love you, dad."
908,Bart,"milhouse, what a pleasant surprise."
872,Bart,"mom, i want to be a rock star."
4946,Bart,yeah.
2920,Bart,that must be the happiest kid in the world.
1821,Bart,kbbl is gonna give me something stupid!
6257,Bart,"okay, let's hear it."
170,Bart,your house? that's crazy talk!
2706,Bart,there's the real milhouse.
6354,Bart,what? i've gotta be in the same class as her?
395,Bart,twins. open your present.
6697,Bart,saunter!
11144,Bart,"hey, if they get on an airbus, they know they're taking their chances."
226,Bart,"well, enjoy it while you can. everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
8385,Bart,"hey, i'm fine -- they haven't made a french horn yet that can hurt me. now, i'm sending you a picture of the bomb."
2283,Bart,"hey, mom! look at me, mom!"
10443,Bart,a thousand kids?! if you could get each of them to send you a dollar you'd be a millionaire!
10020,Bart,"aw, and they gave me my own vanity plate."
2489,Bart,hey!
11779,Bart,thanks for the real working light saber!
11435,Bart,where are you going?
3412,Bart,wooo! we're number one! we're number one!
1257,Bart,"wow, dad. you really know your monorails."
6947,Bart,"dad, you've been driving in circles for twenty minutes."
3589,Bart,"beep beep! comin' through! hey, notre dame, move it or lose it! ah-oo-ga! will the owner of the great big butt please move it out of my face?"
7531,Bart,i learned my lesson -- mr. spangler showed me the true cost of my junk food addiction.
9435,Bart,much better.
5005,Bart,i must only use this power to annoy.
8533,Bart,stop feeling sorry for him! he's a homicidal maniac! he deserves to fry!
5489,Bart,"hmm... oh, whoa! too hot!"
1942,Bart,my fantasy's come true.
6446,Bart,"okay, gotta focus, gotta focus, gotta look at that bird, gotta focus."
3606,Bart,excuse me.
9369,Bart,"are you from the orphanage, or do i really not understand how babies are born?"
4998,Bart,are you a zombie?
10910,Bart,it's eight in the morning!
1924,Bart,"don't you see, milhouse? we've gone too far. we need skinner back."
4188,Bart,why is she saying all this? is she dying?
10219,Bart,check this out: a dead possum.
4585,Bart,not if i know cartoons!
5264,Bart,"oh, man. that would be so awesome!"
1993,Bart,can't you give me anything for it?
2494,Bart,"me and santa's little helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!"
10701,Bart,my ex-girlfriends.
2741,Bart,"there was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though."
9916,Bart,okay. you got me. but i'm gettin' my dirt bike -- and you can't stop me.
10648,Bart,it was the best week of all of our lives... and i wanted it to last forever.
13048,Bart,don't talk to me when i'm vibrating.
4457,Bart,where's the hose?
249,Bart,"hey mom, dad's in a mental institution."
453,Bart,"hello, my name's dimitri. i'm a first time caller, long time listener."
3791,Bart,"but if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
1496,Bart,fascinating.
3869,Bart,ohh. uhl. you can be lisa's.
4671,Bart,you wanna hold it for a while?
4981,Bart,i told you they were monitoring my activities.
11256,Bart,dad?
2628,Bart,"if you get lost remember, you can always find east by staring directly at the sun."
4941,Bart,really?
6064,Bart,"pedals, people."
3409,Bart,uh-huh.
11840,Bart,i'm bart simpson. who the hell are you?
3461,Bart,i'm not a girl! are you blind?
907,Bart,"hey, wait otto-man, you can't leave. milhouse isn't here yet."
5563,Bart,i was trying to breed the hamster with the lizard to create an unholy super-creature... when i saw an even worse crime against nature.
234,Bart,lisa it's your birthday /
857,Bart,"dad, when aunt selma lights up her cigarette at the end of macgyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!"
10874,Bart,i won't. i'm gonna ignore everything else on my schedule.
5681,Bart,"oh, can i have some?"
4445,Bart,it's the first day of school.
4683,Bart,now we come to mr. homer simpson...
3828,Bart,"hey, armin."
10226,Bart,i can't believe a middle-aged woman is scared of a three-story drop.
8419,Bart,"no, things rich people buy, like campbell's soup and pepsodent."
4193,Bart,me. i smell a museum.
3146,Bart,martin.
10823,Bart,"that's okay, he is pretty lame. hey... wanna watch tv?"
9840,Bart,a kid at school's gonna beat me up.
12512,Bart,"both arms, ma'am."
1936,Bart,sure.
12913,Bart,fine. now just get inside already.
1426,Bart,"dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect."
3532,Bart,"yeah... i guess this means you can't ever try to kill me again, huh?"
6803,Bart,but a tango takes two!
12096,Bart,"what's the matter with you, soldier?"
5027,Bart,"yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you."
5657,Bart,"oh, boo hoo. after all the times i've done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer."
10752,Bart,i don't exist?
11939,Bart,i had a little accident in chemistry today.
7829,Bart,kid power!
240,Bart,happy birthday lisa /
5218,Bart,get bent.
8867,Bart,"sure, i got my seatbelt on."
12438,Bart,"take him away, boys."
9227,Bart,"what's ""the answer?"""
6330,Bart,"quiet, youse!"
5948,Bart,"hurry up, dad!"
2571,Bart,"hello, i'm dr. cheeks. i'm doing my rounds and uh, i'm a little behind."
7177,Bart,i am!
6688,Bart,"oh, i missed you so much, boy."
10471,Bart,"that might be a good idea, but then again, you thought it up. eh, why not?"
8412,Bart,we knew you could do it!
76,Bart,what do you care about good comics? all you ever buy is casper the wimpy ghost.
1065,Bart,"please lis, they prefer to be called the living impaired."
6703,Bart,"knowing you, you'd mess it up somehow."
77,Bart,"well, you know what i think? i think casper's the ghost of richie rich."
7897,Bart,this rocks! no more stupid girl classes -- like ballroom dancing!
10723,Bart,wow. what are you doin' for money?
11400,Bart,stupid kid. do you really think that's the way we should communicate?
2147,Bart,cool! i call the flintstone phone!
5911,Bart,i studied! abraca-turn-into-a-prince-guy?
8930,Bart,ow! the ol' hot spoon. but why?
3322,Bart,"he's kidding, mom. but seriously, i'd love to have hair like yours -- i just can't get the zoning permits."
371,Bart,i guess that's okay.
8320,Bart,why do you think that?
5944,Bart,can that judge do this to us?
6037,Bart,but how are we supposed to get it?
1125,Bart,"look, grampa, i'm fine! i really don't need any more home remedies."
8055,Bart,re-lace them all!
1908,Bart,"boys and girls, mrs. krabappel, i come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- what has four legs and ticks?"
3742,Bart,"no, act like a lion!"
12980,Bart,"i'm sorry, boy. you can't help being dumb."
4054,Bart,does it matter?
5533,Bart,"finally, books for today's busy idiot. ""network programming for dummies""... ""christianity for dummies""... ""mo""-- ""moby dick?""... ""call me ishmael, dummy."""
1621,Bart,what an odd thing to say.
2688,Bart,"look behind you, radioactive man! the sun is exploding again!"
9019,Bart,"if she doesn't like coconut, you're screwed!"
8333,Bart,what'd you do with all the loot?
1705,Bart,"by the way, your martinis suck!"
9755,Bart,this won't even cover the vig on what i owe!
12028,Bart,"yo, otto-man."
9712,Bart,"and a one, and a two, and a..."
3536,Bart,why you wearing it now?
4793,Bart,"ohh, dad, you're sitting on my arm."
8661,Bart,by which i meant bring martin's butterfly project to completion.

6678,Bart,who the hell are you?
939,Bart,"listen, milhouse. i've got a confession to make. i'm the one who narked on your kissing."
10615,Bart,really?! but that's been in your family for generations...
4789,Bart,no! the bush set me up!
3509,Bart,"and god bless mom and dad and lisa and maggie, and please, god, kill sideshow bob --"
443,Bart,no!
1301,Bart,"hello, bigger brothers? my name is bart simpson and i don't have a father."
7219,Bart,there's an open house next door. they're giving out cookies and business cards!
5209,Bart,you can't do that to duncan. it's not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
8989,Bart,stupid angry mob... chasing me because i shine a harsh light on modern society. now i know how dane cook feels.
229,Bart,"okay, uh-huh. okay, okay,. okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! i'm doing it! birthday gift coming your way!"

6115,Bart,"greta, i miss you so much. please be my girlfriend again."
7804,Bart,"well homer, looks like i can't go to discipline camp. which is too bad, 'cause i think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out."
10621,Bart,double upgrade!
4446,Bart,"dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars."
12416,Bart,"come on, lisa. i think i can prove krusty's innocent, but i need your help."
5803,Bart,"aw, come on, guys, we've only got a few minutes..."
2889,Bart,yeow!
1001,Bart,doh-kay.
4493,Bart,"we're all proud of you, dad."
6813,Bart,let's see someone claim that money now.
4131,Bart,"hey, somebody screwed up bad! you've got all these big comics lined up for your show, but there's no krusty."
4336,Bart,"well, maybe they should have three. i'm bart simpson."
11845,Bart,"i'll say, dad. you must really love us to sink so low."
6204,Bart,we found you smoldering in the bushes.
5966,Bart,"no, it's terrible."
3264,Bart,look inside.
12489,Bart,"whoa, take that, granny! oh, hide in the closet. oh no, deadly mothballs."
1310,Bart,father-son picnic.
1975,Bart,"i guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
8111,Bart,we were just having fun. don't get upset.
9316,Bart,"dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on sunday?"
459,Bart,"i don't know, he's pretty sharp. he saw right through this disguise."
4469,Bart,they're all about smugglers.
6740,Bart,"good grief, this candy's terrible."
6035,Bart,"attention everyone, this is gabriel, my personal social worker. he has to be here. i'm just that nuts."
8591,Bart,here's a little hair of the dog for tomorrow.
10063,Bart,uh... nobody. wrong number.
1486,Bart,hmmm.
11832,Bart,ow! quit it. it used to be a real boss tattoo.
3777,Bart,freak-outs?
8085,Bart,"okay, just walk in, say happy birthday, and get out."
12486,Bart,"yes, ma'am."
828,Bart,it's over.
2387,Bart,i'm more striking than lovely.
11455,Bart,it's the first i've seen it.
4569,Bart,my school picture!!
10577,Bart,"uh, yeah, me. i use it all the time."
4364,Bart,dealing drugs?
11817,Bart,"oh, please. there's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't santa."
3309,Bart,"i was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but you guys asked for it..."
6217,Bart,i feel so european.
3014,Bart,let's go to the sharper image. they've got a tv shaped like a fifties diner!
3233,Bart,"it's the last day of school, milhouse. try to show some dignity."
11459,Bart,"oh, yawn. another freebie. better be a sixty-four gig."
2528,Bart,"but basically, krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want."
708,Bart,hmmm.
10948,Bart,oh yeah!
949,Bart,"unky herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
10899,Bart,um... why don't we discuss it over dinner?
5661,Bart,"quiet, principal spinner."
9703,Bart,yo. bart simpson. no doubt you read about me in your nuisance neighbor disclosure.
2743,Bart,...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
11118,Bart,ninja throwing soap!
9260,Bart,"thanks for bringing me here, dad. i'll remember this day on my deathbed."
3302,Bart,we want to go back to springfield.
9913,Bart,"bow, bow, bow, bow, bing, bang, boom!"
8861,Bart,"which one, the one that got canceled or the one that's gonna get canceled?"
3258,Bart,"hey, lis."
2586,Bart,"when i said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me."
6297,Bart,"my bubble, my rules."
10489,Bart,ay carumba!
8075,Bart,"milhouse, steady my duds!"
8285,Bart,"lis, you can't stay here if you're gonna keep talking."
11735,Bart,i don't see any breasts.
2024,Bart,but you're wearing your glasses.
1697,Bart,"hi, dad."
7443,Bart,lisa... you just poked my feelings. i'm sorry too.
9145,Bart,"are you nuts?! milhouse will spill everything. by which i mean juice, not secrets!"
3144,Bart,"cruise control, my good man. everybody all set back here? nelson, good to see you! martin, always a pleasure..."
12721,Bart,"hey boy, come here! you're a good dog! come on, we don't need them to get a thanksgiving dinner!"
6435,Bart,mm hm.

8773,Bart,i've never seen them before.
6110,Bart,i'm a ten year old boy in toronto. i should be the happiest kid in the world... but i can't stop thinking about greta.
182,Bart,one more step and you're a dead man.
10849,Bart,"guys who call themselves ""preacher"" or ""deacon"" are very bad. water is money unless gasoline is money. and even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves."
7243,Bart,party! party! party! party!
10431,Bart,that's not you. they just painted shrek yellow.
3065,Bart,"""i want to help you, george washington?"" even your dreams are square."
891,Bart,"you can do it, otto. you're the coolest adult i ever met."
11152,Bart,"yeah, it's like looking down a canadian tunnel."
8782,Bart,like what?
9255,Bart,"...so you see, it was my fault. i got mrs. krabappel drunk. and then i was gonna do the same thing to zack, but i decided it was better to just tell the truth."
1287,Bart,"hey man, if the line's this long, it's gotta be good."
11809,Bart,saluki strut!
9105,Bart,did you unscrew all the phillips heads?
11429,Bart,"man, krusty should get some of these letters."
10170,Bart,bart... i haven't been selling the truffles. i've been eating them.
2110,Bart,"don't worry, mom. we'll make you proud of us."
12039,Bart,"well, i'd have to say... your generous nature, your spirit of giving."
2878,Bart,daaadd! hellllp!
9077,Bart,i am so staying up past my bedtime.
5450,Bart,crashing down!
406,Bart,nah. i'm just depressed. milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
12207,Bart,"aw, dad."

3857,Bart,hm...
102,Bart,please dad.
5505,Bart,"c'mon, lis. there's gotta be a way to lure that badger out."
2253,Bart,you're gonna eat a blizzard of...
11837,Bart,"hey, milhouse. i dare you to sit on his lap."
5373,Bart,"dad, that's a sports bra."
4722,Bart,"i hope you're happy, nelson."
1004,Bart,are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
11295,Bart,would you take me to buy a comic book tuesday at midnight?
1267,Bart,"dad, you're a hero!"
5576,Bart,i'm just mad all the time.
9994,Bart,i gotta have that mini-bike!
8193,Bart,"look, darcy, maybe there's still a way we can get married."
1606,Bart,cool!
3953,Bart,wow! i wish i had an elephant.
5548,Bart,man i need a job.
9224,Bart,milhouse... we ruined edna's life. maybe we can get her job back.
35,Bart,"whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. i just can't believe it was her."
245,Bart,uh-huh. and is elvis with you?
2150,Bart,how the hell do you know?
7006,Bart,what's wrong?
8406,Bart,it won't come off!
8319,Bart,"i still can't believe it. they dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush, so we have to play the last inning over again."
11925,Bart,"whoa! yeah, strike three! you're outta there."
10839,Bart,"yeah, but at least it was short."
3627,Bart,"oh... i love you, edna krabappel."
7207,Bart,"sure thing, jerk."
10755,Bart,"now to return to a future where i'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. either way, better than now."
8651,Bart,lisa! you're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?
10354,Bart,choke on fossil poop!
4350,Bart,"way to go, officer!"
10652,Bart,nelson took my lunch money again!
8349,Bart,"i miss santa's little helper. i wanted him to be a police dog, but now he has no time for me. i even have to eat my own homework!"
3445,Bart,can i be a boozehound?
4928,Bart,help! help! fire!... ... helmets.
5853,Bart,"okay, okay."
619,Bart,wha th...?
2478,Bart,"heh, heh. they're finally paying me for this."
8317,Bart,see? i hate me too! now we can be friends again!
11501,Bart,"a minute of fun, a lifetime of work. i've never heard of a pregnancy like this."
720,Bart,"penny for your thoughts, mrs. k."
5643,Bart,this stinks. we'll miss the itchy and scratchy where they finally kiss.
10828,Bart,i don't see him anywhere. you jackass! you lost our dog!
9676,Bart,huh? / whoa.
8135,Bart,gil's gone.
12476,Bart,it's about these pirates. pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
10634,Bart,woo-hoo! vacation forever!!!!!
9180,Bart,"oh my god, look what they serve in the cafeteria!"
11825,Bart,"but, mom, i thought you'd like it."

6817,Bart,sweet! what am i gonna do with a thousand dollars?
5235,Bart,got 'im!
10340,Bart,goorsha!
855,Bart,"she happily watched her macgyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. all it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette..."
8621,Bart,you were like a brother to me! we were gonna take woodshop together and make nunchucks. and then take people to our lockers and show them our nunchucks!
11750,Bart,"oh, god, no."
5768,Bart,i was... i was...
9492,Bart,"exciting, exciting. i just have one question: is curling a real thing?"
10476,Bart,"according to the wisdom of our elders...if you go all the way around on the swing, your body will turn inside-out."
7877,Bart,i think he's in the house!
6358,Bart,"i know. that's how you remember the four original provinces of canada: quebec, new brunswick, ontario, nova scotia -- ""quiet nerds burp only near school."" and here's how you remember the principal exports: ""dogs eat barf solely on wednesday, mabel."""
11898,Bart,"what should i read, ma'am?"
8465,Bart,why give 'em the choice? that trick was sweeter than any treat we'll get tonight.
6440,Bart,"dad, i'm really glad you're still alive."

6658,Bart,"let it go, dad."
12807,Bart,what? why?
5675,Bart,and this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
3255,Bart,"hey, you guys! you wanna see how cool lisa simpson really is?"
715,Bart,"hey, lis, a moment of your time."
6381,Bart,"well, as far as nerdy little sisters go, you're the coolest."
7479,Bart,are you watching? are you watching?
4141,Bart,"no! no, i was talkin' to lisa back there, we both agreed you killed."
3215,Bart,"dad, please. you're embarrassing us."
8949,Bart,"i never thought i'd say this, but i missed you guys. even what's her name, lisa."
10549,Bart,what's goin' on? is this a joke?
12384,Bart,"come on, mister. can you help me?"
5684,Bart,dad!
6464,Bart,"i'd like to nominate my teacher, mrs. krabappel. she may not be glamorous or entertaining... she's just a real teacher who comes in every day no matter what. and she never gave up on me, bart simpson."
12200,Bart,arewethereyet arewethereyet arewethereyet?
2380,Bart,what's really amazing is that this is exactly what dad said would happen.
5709,Bart,looks like our lifetime ban just expired.
7292,Bart,"vroom vroom. vroom vroom... vroom, vroom."
2327,Bart,okay.
7872,Bart,"hell, yeah!"
12573,Bart,it is.
13101,Bart,"hi, mrs. k. this is sure weird, huh?"
4748,Bart,"okay, if you're gonna live in my room, you're gonna obey my rules. one: i am bart, thy god. if i am out, the krusty doll is thy god. if the doll's with me, you will worship the night light. should the night light be unable to fulfill its duties..."
12705,Bart,here?
7935,Bart,"sit on it, springfield! yeah!"
8487,Bart,"come on! look at me, i'm cool. i've got my backpack on frontwards, and i'm krumping!"

3939,Bart,this thing only takes dollars.
9113,Bart,"oh, right. um, i was thinking of other things that are hilarious. like... things that you think are funny."
3815,Bart,"speaking of shoes, i don't care about shoes. i'll meet you ladies back here in half an hour."
11894,Bart,"no rush, dad. take the scenic route."
12025,Bart,"teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser..."
1532,Bart,what do you want?
1898,Bart,"i'm sorry, dad... you're fired!"
2713,Bart,have you seen milhouse?
7579,Bart,"i'll show you, i'll move thirty-three inches away."
10965,Bart,nice. time for your final test.
7708,Bart,"this southern man don't need him 'round, anyhow! mom, who's neil young?"
3433,Bart,"ma, i need a glass of milk."
1976,Bart,shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
505,Bart,grave digger.
11577,Bart,"krusty, why don't you talk to your dad? he'll cheer you up. he's a rabbi. he must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading."
8565,Bart,we wanna hear a story!
10191,Bart,"once you get past the sister ick, they're fine."
9333,Bart,"all right, i'll watch a dvd."
12859,Bart,but i'm talkin' about shaft.
5915,Bart,i'd like that. i'd like that very much.
1148,Bart,i'll never wash this hand again.

2278,Bart,"mom, that is really annoying."
11647,Bart,"dad, it's not a private school. it's free."
6355,Bart,roosters don't lay eggs. they're boys.
2632,Bart,i assumed i could.
5821,Bart,"look at the new kid, hoggin' the teeter-totter. it's like she owns the place."
3377,Bart,milhouse likes you.
5366,Bart,"hey, this is expired!"
3974,Bart,it's crap-tacular.
3547,Bart,may i have some more lima beans?
6897,Bart,"oh man, i sure wish i had a ten-speed bike."
761,Bart,"oh, what's it for?"
2595,Bart,tv with a picture of the mayor on it?
11548,Bart,why am i having nightmares? i'm no coward.
10802,Bart,"dad, all the jury summons you buried in the back yard are coming back up!"
7592,Bart,"mom, that's blasphemy! i'll say a rosary for you."
2708,Bart,"hey, cool, milhouse! you get to be crushed by a truck!"
1237,Bart,what did you say?

12402,Bart,"thanks, krusty."

10395,Bart,if genn-i-oos--
7210,Bart,"lis, i've learned a valuable lesson here: the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop."
176,Bart,"fine. we're all going to stay here with the comic book. it'll be like a sleep-over. yeah, a sleep-over. that's what pals do, right? real friendly-like."
6342,Bart,"woo! yay, homer!"
7755,Bart,"here you go, dad. i hope you like it. i've forgotten what it is."
7710,Bart,batting cage?
10360,Bart,this better not turn out like kansas city.
845,Bart,"hey, they chose maggie, okay?"
11534,Bart,"no one likes veggie smoothies that much. or at all. something's fishy about that girl, and i'm gonna follow her till i find out what."
4926,Bart,"look, a fire!..."
2136,Bart,ow!
1577,Bart,"milhouse. milhouse, wake up. quick, look out the window."

11788,Bart,"whoa, that is the best deal any songwriter ever got. and that's true even if i don't get the brownies. i'm in."
9578,Bart,"no, they're all about chomping neck. and they don't put product in their hair like this loser."

6567,Bart,"dad, you don't understand. this was never about being cool. it was about you not caring how i felt."
3306,Bart,"this isn't a belt, it's a tactical pants-retaining system. check it out: compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon-slash-lie detector, sphygmomanometer... and it's even got turn signals!"
6956,Bart,"mom, everyone who ever lived is boring."

1812,Bart,"i don't get it, lis. you said everything would be back to normal, but homer and flanders are still friends."

7364,Bart,"dad, you completely sold me out!"

11363,Bart,"so, why can't i go there?"
2217,Bart,"actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, i just might be able to hold on."

3314,Bart,"you'll be okay, dad. just make sure he hits you an even number of times so you don't end up with amnesia."
8874,Bart,"viagra at five dollars a pill? whatever it is, it's goin' in skinner's coffee."

8442,Bart,"well, i know he seems to get dumber every year, but lately he's plateaued."
10625,Bart,"alright fun schedule, you're about to get did!"
2825,Bart,"help! lisa, help!"
12249,Bart,no.
8654,Bart,nothing!
10716,Bart,we're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
12851,Bart,"what? we could have bought tons of great stuff, mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if i'm wrong."
3695,Bart,no. he just wasn't the right dog for me. i'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
12926,Bart,is not.
12736,Bart,"a...listen, guys i was thinking, uh... unless you'd feel weird about taking money from a kid...i thought maybe..."
12703,Bart,"can't i help you, mom?"
4343,Bart,"""should i abandon hope or fight on bravely against impossible odds? oh, this is too perfect."
9975,Bart,i made you a coffee mug on mother's day! isn't that enough?
1430,Bart,"yo, grampa! time for the awards."
8307,Bart,whatever. i'm gonna go play outside.
8808,Bart,i can't believe you're working for krusty and i'm not. i know everything about that clown. favorite blintz -- blueberry. favorite horse in the 2004 belmont -- smarty jones. krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in norway. which i have a case of!
1062,Bart,"let's see what we've got... ""how to get your skeletons their whitest""... ""selling your soul in a buyer's market""... ah, here we are, ""how to raise the dead."""
475,Bart,we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster.
10453,Bart,um... well... this is usually the part where you say you're sorry.
8711,Bart,"...raise articulator, set hydraulic brakes and endorse farm subsidy check for crops i didn't grow."
4084,Bart,"well, can we at least keep the bikes?"
981,Bart,"don't look in my closet. in fact, stay out of my room all together."
3007,Bart,"i begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
1249,Bart,nothing you say can upset us. we're the mtv generation.
343,Bart,hey girls! look at me!
5128,Bart,"you're dead, squealer."
10249,Bart,"same garbage, different dumpster."
9793,Bart,milhouse! do we have enough points for a weapons upgrade?
562,Bart,"mom, i never won before. i may never win again. nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"
12202,Bart,nice grizzles.
6729,Bart,"well, that's it. they've beaten us."
2739,Bart,"wow, dad, you took a baptismal for me. how do you feel?"
6053,Bart,"i prefer to egg him on. hey dad, has the movie started yet?"
7236,Bart,canned and frozen juices are more popular than ever these days. but most bachelors we know would prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes.
303,Bart,cool! a ruckus!
1482,Bart,somebody ought to ruin gabbo's career the way he ruined krusty's.
6091,Bart,sey-mour...
292,Bart,"really, you want that one? it's all yours. whatever you say."
11187,Bart,"all right, i'll turn myself in. it'll give me a chance to work some more on the detention quilt."
7238,Bart,uh... toys?
10074,Bart,either the grave or somewhere much worse.
2194,Bart,no i'm not. i'm really...
6429,Bart,"they're gay, i get it."
10352,Bart,lisa has a big toy! no fair! that means i get two small toys!
4961,Bart,"i think it's the bright blue pants. i mean, you're not on a golf course."
3266,Bart,did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
4890,Bart,fine. i don't care what you're doin'.
10045,Bart,i'm bored.
9062,Bart,what about my birthday party?
10576,Bart,i stole this...
2017,Bart,you got it.
7825,Bart,time for the bombarded to become the bombardier.
868,Bart,what a gyp!
9221,Bart,sorry. sorry.
11514,Bart,"i wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! pub crawls, naked frisbee golf..."
11293,Bart,they killed off radioactive man?! i did not see that coming. die carumba.
8783,Bart,pass.
9546,Bart,"dad, i know you're gonna say no, but mom would say..."
1119,Bart,yeah.
5791,Bart,really? you saw our b.f.n.?
5742,Bart,"yeah, you know her."
6316,Bart,can't i at least incite further...
973,Bart,"no, sir."
7131,Bart,the man asked a question.
870,Bart,knock it off.
5989,Bart,just leave the bottle.
5621,Bart,"wow, he did."
12308,Bart,"uh oh, it's the fe-mail man."
11172,Bart,ay carumba!
638,Bart,talk is cheap. perhaps a test of thy faith. walk through the wall. i will remove it for you...later.
1221,Bart,crib! crib! i'm a baby!
11137,Bart,and we looked and we saw him...
2817,Bart,yes.
11354,Bart,listen... what happened in that tree?
4652,Bart,"hey, my milk! i traded my math book for that!"
8594,Bart,"bathroom passes, doctor's notes..."
9092,Bart,"k-i/s-s-m-y/a-s-s spells ""kiss my ass""!"
8946,Bart,heard what?
9683,Bart,not perfect?! you can say that again.
12220,Bart,"hey, dad. can i have five bucks?"
3553,Bart,"oh, i'm a baby, huh? well, then i'll act like a baby."
4260,Bart,wait for me!
4597,Bart,whooa!
8813,Bart,"how 'bout ""radioactive man versus restless leg syndrome""?"
4228,Bart,"hi, guys. hot enough for ya?"
11160,Bart,i'm afraid i am.
364,Bart,no.
2457,Bart,dang.
10062,Bart,i'm going to the os-cars! not as a seat fill-er! i'll get a gift bas-ket! but i won't de-clare it!
1693,Bart,"oh, i couldn't read it. the letters are all blurry."
7716,Bart,"wow, mom, i love tea!"
7371,Bart,"well, time to face my punishment like a man... or, lie my way out of it like a kid."
6371,Bart,"lisa, how could you? the governor is crying."
3654,Bart,order by phone. 1-800 -- our phone doesn't go up to eight hundred. unless...
12741,Bart,"lisa, i beg of you. please forgive me."
6804,Bart,"lis, you made this school even worse. and it wasn't exactly san diego state to begin with."
1649,Bart,"ok... we're young, rich and full of sugar. what do we do?"
10293,Bart,he opened his eyes! mommm!
2953,Bart,"hey, how come you're not playing bonestorm?"
11805,Bart,"how come there's never a ""take your son to work day?"""
861,Bart,"hey homer, let's book! i want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act."
5268,Bart,"nice suit, jeeves!"
12150,Bart,"put up your dukes, homer."
7955,Bart,you suck!
10449,Bart,milhouse!
3441,Bart,"oh, man."
10809,Bart,gotcha!

12677,Bart,you got it.
477,Bart,i can do that but i don't wanna.
11663,Bart,must be a secret government project.
10754,Bart,"ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape."
9144,Bart,sorry i'm late. i didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
2437,Bart,"so, uh, what's your hurry to get to school?"
7135,Bart,they might not be dead -- they could be in the basement!
796,Bart,"yeah, but even i had my limits. you're looking at expulsion for this."
11890,Bart,"aw, come on, mom."
5103,Bart,"and i want funzo's dream fortress, funzo's lower-back-pain chair, funzo's european voltage converter..."
335,Bart,and... looks like i got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
12355,Bart,"i'm outta here, man."
2966,Bart,"everybody thinks i'm the black sheep. well, i'll show them what a black sheep can do."
9995,Bart,those are girl overalls.
5539,Bart,"mush, homer, mush!"
4738,Bart,"oh, what a gyp. they're all just lying around. do something!"
3776,Bart,military school?! you lied to me!
5699,Bart,i'm picking the next thing.
10936,Bart,"aw, man! we just missed it."
675,Bart,"in here, mom. but don't open the--"
9885,Bart,nooooo!
4987,Bart,"well, that's great, dad, except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper."
7200,Bart,"dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?"
503,Bart,we both had nightmares.
9859,Bart,"look, i know you're cool now, but my dad hates you more than celery, and my mom said no new pets -- so i'm hiding you in my room."
688,Bart,in your bed?
9282,Bart,exactly. crisscross! do we have a deal?
499,Bart,"good night, dad. you know, these last few days have been really swell. i wish there was something i could do to repay you."
8284,Bart,dad! it's drederick tatum. try to get him to punch you.
7363,Bart,but you said i could go if i paid for the ticket!
3851,Bart,no.
11181,Bart,whatever.
4394,Bart,hm. i guess that we don't have to go to school.
3199,Bart,wo-o-o-ow!
1124,Bart,"i'm halfway through it, i swear!"
6072,Bart,those weren't bullies. that's a bully.
3224,Bart,dear bart and lisa...
12837,Bart,"i did go away, mom! i was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of hell. and you were there! and you! and you! and you! you i've never seen before."
11018,Bart,"this case is goin' great. although as usual, i look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing."
4069,Bart,check this out!
7204,Bart,you better -- i've already sold a bunch of subscriptions. how do you think i got these swell prizes!
6198,Bart,are you crazy? i can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
3626,Bart,i won't say it!
11005,Bart,but i'm so pretty.
13125,Bart,"cheer up, milhouse. you got your whole life ahead of you."
6241,Bart,"hm, all i need is one classic character..."
120,Bart,uh... nothing.
12428,Bart,"i don't think so, sir."
7608,Bart,"when they put santa in the ambulance, why did they pull the blanket all the way up over his head?"
8383,Bart,"but it looks so cool. listen, there's a mole inside ctu."
10199,Bart,"maybe this key will be the key to putting the ""key"" in anarchy."
1351,Bart,"unhand me, yankee."
7711,Bart,rock climbing wall?
2809,Bart,"you dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?"
3196,Bart,on a treasure hunt.
8935,Bart,fancy party! this is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
7643,Bart,"oh, mr. van houten, i love when you kiss me! yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. oh baby, kiss my mouth. kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel."
10080,Bart,"no, no. you're augustus gloop, the fat german boy!"
602,Bart,"i thought it was over. you had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. the feel-good story of the year."
5957,Bart,"come on, homer."
8034,Bart,"whoa, krusty's prop room!"
4504,Bart,won't you get in trouble if your mom sees you doing that?
4276,Bart,"that's it! ralph, you're a genius!"
5080,Bart,"uhh, little help?"
2126,Bart,can you believe i keep gettin' away with this... officer?
3286,Bart,"sure you were, rummy."
880,Bart,"rough day, apu. pump me a squishee and don't spare the syrup."
464,Bart,"but... but... but, but rabbi, does it not say in the babylonian talmud... and i quote, ""a child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
1788,Bart,just what i was gonna say.
4858,Bart,oh no! pirates!
4996,Bart,they'll never believe a simpson killed a flanders by accident. even i have my doubts.
2681,Bart,"d.n.a., positive i.d. -- those won't hold up in any court -- run, dad!"
3077,Bart,"it's valuable, huh?"
6078,Bart,yeah.

8450,Bart,whoa. is that a ray gun?
8198,Bart,"take my wife... please! hey, i finally get that joke!"
4138,Bart,sorry.
1451,Bart,"deformed? why didn't you say so? they should call this book ""johnny deformed!"""
11584,Bart,rabbi rudenstein. your father's favorite.
6225,Bart,what's a telegram?
8473,Bart,cool.
6687,Bart,uh oh! who will save that poor fat man?
2067,Bart,hurry up and finish eating!
11247,Bart,"i know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but i got screwed. is there anything you can do?"
6600,Bart,this is not about me. or how many times i voted.
2169,Bart,"good morning, father dear. hope you're well."
11719,Bart,i got a baseball glove!
6178,Bart,the lady knows funny.
9350,Bart,and one for mom.
12234,Bart,"don't worry, guys. it's on me. share the wealth, that's what i always say."
9554,Bart,it's weird -- i just made an entire town lose its lunch...
11782,Bart,fatty and smell-ya.
2347,Bart,yay! go weather balloon! hurrah for science! woo!
3662,Bart,"c'mon, boy, let's go for a walk!"
9555,Bart,...and i'm not feeling the rush.
5299,Bart,"what happened to you, man? you used to be cool."
4072,Bart,"oh, you'll never make it, dad!"
10270,Bart,my book is missing page thirty-two.
1583,Bart,"uh, sure. well, now that we're friends, uter, how 'bout loosening these straps, huh?"
3983,Bart,"oh, aunt selma. always good for a fin. whoa-ho-ho. here we go."
11679,Bart,this new teacher i got gave me a haircut.
5861,Bart,cool.
9265,Bart,"mom, don't do this! this sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you!"
5687,Bart,"okay, okay."
10094,Bart,"and homer, he is back with mom / you can watch this tomorrow at hulu.com."
2162,Bart,what's haggis?
2392,Bart,"i know i've seen it go the other way. ah, faithful toilet. you'll prove me right."
4969,Bart,they have it now.
9635,Bart,"mom, you don't play with lisa. you play despite her."
4520,Bart,no! not the face!
10434,Bart,i did it just to mess with your mind.
6713,Bart,who is he talking to?
7510,Bart,no thanks -- the vending machines at school feed me now.
5480,Bart,so you know it's great.
9810,Bart,that blank can be any letter we want!
10097,Bart,cut it out!
6532,Bart,i said i want a divorce from my parents.
5683,Bart,did you do those exercises he gave you?
1193,Bart,"shove it? ""shove it?"""
552,Bart,"dad, i love you, but you taught me to win."
7161,Bart,"now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade..."
4914,Bart,you betcha.
3160,Bart,we've got no car!
5273,Bart,"all right! time for some underage gambling. so long, sucker!"
8328,Bart,"no, play!"
11313,Bart,i rubbed it on milhouse.
1797,Bart,"oh no, not another boring space launch! change the channel! change the channel!"
9324,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, i am a big dummy with a stupid job. i write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. could the court reporter read that back?"
7435,Bart,why should i go inside? the world is my toilet now.
12275,Bart,"all the way from gay paree. four bucks, plus tax."
8292,Bart,mommm!
7589,Bart,"for preaching christianity to the romans, the emperor diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows."
8234,Bart,yes!
10570,Bart,"oh, that is cool. looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head."
694,Bart,"mom, i think i speak for everyone in this bed when i say you have nothing to worry about. now let's just try and get a little shut eye, okay?"
893,Bart,"what are you going to do, otto?"
11827,Bart,ay carumba!
537,Bart,"thanks, but i'm almost done. why don't you get back on the couch and watch tv?"
9154,Bart,"hit me again, 'pu."
96,Bart,"all right, homer. whoa, you really are a sport, dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger!"
12093,Bart,sound off!
7754,Bart,ay carumba.
325,Bart,i grow weary of this new channel. change it back.
5587,Bart,"wow, it's approved by the royal magic college of hyderabad."
3757,Bart,"just a minute, van houten. somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. how'd you like to be night watchman?"
11778,Bart,"musk rulez. with a ""z."""
7567,Bart,what'm i gonna be? black knight? court ninja? bart the impaler?
8405,Bart,etch... sketch... etch... sketch...
8279,Bart,oh my god!
5375,Bart,"ooo, italian."
415,Bart,"it's his mom. she says i'm a bad influence. c'mon maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
3737,Bart,maybe it's a box from the future!
6578,Bart,"hey, lisa said she was--"
3129,Bart,go to work with your parents day?
4043,Bart,hm... one of these must activate the flame thrower.
8680,Bart,"well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints..."
2151,Bart,but dad can't afford six dollars a night.
4436,Bart,"priceless like a mother's love, or the good kind of priceless?"
8016,Bart,"willie, you can tell me: who's the mystery wuss who can't eat peanuts?"
3150,Bart,i concur.
11049,Bart,"ah, much better."
11433,Bart,"i'm just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever. eh, why not?"
1197,Bart,homer.
13056,Bart,please kill me!
1108,Bart,how was it?
11177,Bart,milhouse!
3909,Bart,again.
8250,Bart,anything could happen. one of these days i might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
11998,Bart,me.
10973,Bart,"au contraire, starfish hair!"
8463,Bart,"hear me out. it seems to me we gave her a choice: trick or treat. she didn't give us a treat, so..."
6059,Bart,there she is!
8754,Bart,have you seen my sister?
5219,Bart,"don't listen to 'em, d. just remember, you've got a new persona. a new per-so-na."
1490,Bart,"krusty, are you making any money?"
2627,Bart,"okay, here's how it goes. i'm the leader. milhouse is my loyal sidekick. nelson is the tough guy, martin's the smart guy and todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. and now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. to step out of childhood and become men."
11481,Bart,"no it's not, because i hate art."
4782,Bart,"oh, yeah."
411,Bart,ah. i've won second prize in a beauty contest. collect ten bucks.
1891,Bart,it's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
7017,Bart,"didn't have to, i'm a dude."
4924,Bart,you need one.
484,Bart,"jeez, now we're slaves. this paw sucks."
979,Bart,"no, but..."
956,Bart,"much obliged, doll."
12814,Bart,"thanks, nelson."
2614,Bart,"oh, i know you are, but what am i?"
9206,Bart,"maybe mrs. k would be nicer if we ""irish"" up her coffee."
2963,Bart,why didn't you wait for me?
7260,Bart,"mom, the reason god invented deadbolts is to keep people like nelson out of your house."
11643,Bart,right here?
6100,Bart,"greta, is this how it is?"
12747,Bart,aha.
12989,Bart,'bye.
12502,Bart,say... who's up for a little cram session? i'll go first. what was the name of the pilgrim's boat?

12288,Bart,uh-oh. school bus.
6163,Bart,please put buck on. he's my hero.
12257,Bart,hi guys. what's up?
7039,Bart,amendments? regulatory agencies? what the fark-bot?
5620,Bart,you don't smoke a pipe.
10950,Bart,"that's the way people talk about ralph! ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter!"
3402,Bart,they'll buy anything!
2257,Bart,huh?!
12799,Bart,you can't.
8695,Bart,"all right, i get it, i get it."
7451,Bart,i'm on it.
1068,Bart,"dad, you killed the zombie flanders!"
3698,Bart,i don't want a new dog. i want santa's little helper.
11638,Bart,stick your finger in that desk.
9726,Bart,that is bob. guess i was wrong.
9998,Bart,are you kidding? you're the worst dad who ever lived! i'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
9485,Bart,can i get extra credit for a caveman break dance?
6777,Bart,mom made the oops patrol! hot damn!
6027,Bart,"that's it, baby. welcome to marvin gardens."
10534,Bart,"c'mon, dad. you made me mad so i got back at you. how was i to know parents had feelings?"
5260,Bart,"yeah, right, mom. then i'd like a rattle and a wowwipop. actually, i would like a wowwipop."
2734,Bart,but it's only 7 o'clock.
2325,Bart,i don't believe it! principal skinner!
2606,Bart,"wow, that does work."
8039,Bart,"now, there's something i've wanted to do for a long time."
12187,Bart,"don't have a cow, dad."
9730,Bart,"uh, you missed the turn-off, mr. warren."
7468,Bart,help us!
5985,Bart,"yeah, i'd like to speak to a mr. tabooger. first name, ollie."

2964,Bart,stupid family...
3216,Bart,"dad! no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! you have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!"
8932,Bart,you had a crush on my old sister.
6886,Bart,"lis, kids are the problem, maybe kids can be the solution."
1813,Bart,after breakfast me and milhouse are goin' down to the ravine. we got a tip from a six year old that there's a dead martian down there.
3884,Bart,lisa simpson!
489,Bart,good morning.
1441,Bart,"how about ""beans, beans, the musical fruit?"""
12327,Bart,cross your heart and hope to die?
9349,Bart,hope you saved room for passion fruit soufflé with crème anglais for two.
5090,Bart,"i know, but i'm still not gonna do it."
2756,Bart,i sold my soul to milhouse.
6459,Bart,"okay, there's a lot of low cards in that hand. but since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?"
4884,Bart,"ladles and jellyspoons, i will now take going low to new heights. i will swallow anything -- and i mean anything -- you people throw."
2426,Bart,yeah. do the toilets go backwards in here?
5968,Bart,'cuz i felt like it.

33550,Homer,were you listening at all?
16456,Homer,"i, as well. are you happy, jeeves?"
18861,Homer,they all have hilarious names and are delicious.
21971,Homer,uh...
18188,Homer,"oh, marge, don't blame yourself. i'm the terrible parent. the boy bugs the hell outta me, i can't help lisa with her homework. the only thing i'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
33759,Homer,"if marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! help me, mayonnaise!"
31935,Homer,oh my god! what have i done?!
40410,Homer,oh my god! he's enjoying it!
17427,Homer,"hello. i am homer simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""father goose."" you know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. nobody cares that i didn't do it. but i didn't. okay, look, i've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. so i figured, ""we'll see about that."" so i get this big chunk of cinderblock and i..."
36626,Homer,uh-oh. i don't think i rewound the video the last time i was here.
33162,Homer,"marge, i don't want to die with us mad at each other."
22973,Homer,"well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage."
34463,Homer,smithers. what a marshmallow.
39346,Homer,jeez. no beer... no opera dogs...
32040,Homer,"i know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth."
33780,Homer,what cologne are you wearing? none of your business! now we'd like our washington monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
17310,Homer,"what's my name?! what color is the sky?! what of donuts? what?! for the love of god, tell meeeee!!!"
30183,Homer,"oh, i was just driving around the mid-atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and i just... oh, who am i fooling with my awesome lies? i want you to come back to springfield."
22736,Homer,"thank you sir, may i have another?"
22087,Homer,homer simpson -- nerd buster. and i'm gettin' you out of here!
26002,Homer,don't you know who i am?
33562,Homer,huh?
26843,Homer,now let's not get into who smells like what.
34924,Homer,look at that picture!
19890,Homer,"oh, well... fun's over, but i still have my wonderful money."
32845,Homer,can i be smithers?
23621,Homer,"ow! ow, that hurts! owww! ohhh!"
25086,Homer,"see? now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
15681,Homer,"and if that doesn't work, six simple words: ""i'm not gay, but i'll learn."""
21875,Homer,but i can't ask mom. she's on the run from the law.
37885,Homer,"bye bye, money!"
30225,Homer,"wow! up here, that feels good!"
35292,Homer,now it feels like morning. what i am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
31469,Homer,"i just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?"
40882,Homer,he's not home.
17020,Homer,"hey, barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side."
35688,Homer,i guess fun dad is a foodie now!
23473,Homer,"i'm only one man, marge."
31058,Homer,why do you remember them and not me?
13697,Homer,i'll give you twenty bucks for it.
35438,Homer,when we see each other again you'll be an old man and i'll be a baby!
29027,Homer,"oh, i have a funny feeling we will. wherever people are mistreated, the pie man will strike!"
23979,Homer,thanks. this closes the saddest chapter in american history.
34966,Homer,"okay, i'm comin'."
40428,Homer,"speaking of heroes, here's mine... tom turkey!"
22402,Homer,that does it! there's only one thing i can do.
17381,Homer,"run, marge! save the booty!"
34860,Homer,"oh man, this is great. the most evil man in town is in our power. he will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. and anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
18607,Homer,you're off the team.
26799,Homer,"wait, wait. you forgot to eat a light bulb."
24782,Homer,no!
36082,Homer,"hey lenny, welcome aboard."
32053,Homer,"america west, please."
29482,Homer,"well... i'm worried about marge and moe. they've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. but it's not physical. so everything's great, right?"
14891,Homer,"marge, since the kids left, i lost five pounds!"
34335,Homer,"no freedom! i have no freedom around this house! after sex, i'm not talking to you!"
18807,Homer,"okay, i gotcha covered."
35992,Homer,let me just download the complete works of shakespeare.
19939,Homer,"hey, i know where there's lots of paper!"
29603,Homer,"hey, i gotta get in on this! these people have rights! the right to buy me a sixty-two inch tv!"
39375,Homer,i'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much.
24456,Homer,didn't you ever go to camp? the ol' vitamin barn...
27497,Homer,there it is.
32960,Homer,five hundred and one!
16466,Homer,"mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, i think we should avoid each other from now on."
22825,Homer,shaving my shoulders / i'm gettin' it all shaved off...
18576,Homer,"burns never gives money to anybody. just last week, i asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
14766,Homer,to the simpson mobile!
20327,Homer,"ooo, i like the sound of that."
27855,Homer,"""apartment finder: we put you in your place."" ""roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" thank you, news box... it's gone!"
27871,Homer,"well, i'd better go. but before i do, marge, there's something i want to ask you."
23640,Homer,"good girl, maggie. you knocked down all the pins. but you stepped over the line just a little bit, so i'll have to give you a five."
25262,Homer,and it's bad news for the gophers.
22202,Homer,i think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
13407,Homer,"uh, oh."
22808,Homer,"oh, yeah. that's a fine looking..."
24674,Homer,now these are the tunes i want you boys to play.
24792,Homer,"little help, please? i made a boom-boom..."
38483,Homer,we're not similar. i love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! love it!
31839,Homer,so... i thought it went real well. until i swallowed the whistle.
22912,Homer,"lucky stiff. i'm working my ass off here. good steak, honey."
35160,Homer,uh-oh.

28368,Homer,"mmm, moses."

37391,Homer,compliments of the deacon!
19050,Homer,"this baby's sure to kill something. okay, now everybody -- stand back while i celebrate freedom. bart, give me your matches."
26829,Homer,what the hell is that noise?
34719,Homer,his strike zone's the size / of a tuna fish can...
17289,Homer,look at that! i'm the first non- brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
23479,Homer,easy... careful... steady...
24405,Homer,"okay, i'll go quietly."
33363,Homer,so there's a chance i actually won! i've got to dig up that ballot box!
31737,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
24391,Homer,all for homer... all for homer...
32640,Homer,"why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?"
30517,Homer,"what's that, honey? i can't hear you very well!"
17793,Homer,lord save me.
32600,Homer,"and when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here."
29502,Homer,and you're my margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
31399,Homer,"make my daughter cry, will ya! eat syrup, jerk!"
39977,Homer,"i think you're right, dumplin'."
24918,Homer,"oh, they drugged the tea. they knew my one weakness."
20699,Homer,and not a moment too soon.
17700,Homer,no.
40062,Homer,"ah, dinner with three beautiful women. i must be in heaven."
30178,Homer,go! go! go!
34916,Homer,i'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
30104,Homer,"multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six..."
21072,Homer,y'ello.
33529,Homer,"don't worry, honey, i'll be your ""seeing-eye homer."" we're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... um, i'm gonna take my break now."
25811,Homer,"the perfect crime. marge, i have to be in court next tuesday."
16886,Homer,"plants, eh?"
37046,Homer,"we made it, boy!"
20765,Homer,"one game of ring toss. if i can throw this hula hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. if i miss, i'll sign the deed over to you."

20539,Homer,"i'd like a yellow boat, please. with extra motors."
17461,Homer,yeah... where are my pants?
29595,Homer,the lie is love.
13563,Homer,wowww.

38718,Homer,get... in... the tent!
31661,Homer,then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
27314,Homer,"well, duh."
36618,Homer,"uh, well, looking back, i guess it started sometime before bart was born."
28961,Homer,"and now, padre, if you would do the honors."
33408,Homer,"uh, yes. that must be it. this is the best of all possible worlds. blah, blah, blah."
29504,Homer,think of me babe whenever / some sweet talking guy in a thong / hands you a bong / don't take...

30185,Homer,"no, i wanna make you a respecting stock. i don't know if you've noticed, but i've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years..."
16594,Homer,"aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, kent. forty percent of all people know that."
32357,Homer,i'll kill her after dessert!

30489,Homer,"joy to the world, a father's born / let me receive great gifts!"
30355,Homer,uh... this is all i could find.
22056,Homer,"h-heyy, let me off this thing."

30677,Homer,"okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. oh, that sounds hard. just do it!"
16004,Homer,"there are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. now off to bed."
24647,Homer,good idea. we should call the guys they used.
23043,Homer,"i'm squeezing... i'm squee-zing it. hey, i squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
36371,Homer,"i'unno... lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely."

29193,Homer,"see, lisa? instead of one big shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks xeroxing their worthless opinions."
26968,Homer,"hm, no belly-button."

36586,Homer,i'm on it!
29016,Homer,nope. just lookin' for that golden ticket.
32166,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
33897,Homer,"to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. and all our yesterdays have lighted fools. the way to dusty death. out, out, brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. that struts and frets his hour upon the stage. and then is heard no more."
16831,Homer,"ha, ha. you know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
25711,Homer,ow!
30154,Homer,what a combination -- hot chicks and stupid flanders.

18638,Homer,"hey, what's the big deal? it's just some new guy moving in!"
38643,Homer,isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
26778,Homer,"...so anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
25014,Homer,you'd do that for us?
40845,Homer,they must think people will watch anything.
17720,Homer,yeah.
22117,Homer,"kids, i don't want you drinking any more milk. ever."
15441,Homer,"but i'm out of the woods now, right? i mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger."
20752,Homer,that's weird. the key doesn't fit.
29203,Homer,woo hoo!
32561,Homer,"oh, i miss those bygone days of earlier this week. but i'm needed in a darker place."
13768,Homer,"hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. you just have to read the manual and press the right button."
15544,Homer,all aboard!
16405,Homer,you'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
22885,Homer,"adios, ""casa de flanders."""

14940,Homer,"hey, you know. i'm a lot like that guy."
23364,Homer,"dear god, it's homer. if you really love me, you'll save my life now."
35006,Homer,fat tony?
33952,Homer,i'm not asking for a's. just incompletes.
35674,Homer,"all right, food nerds, reality check..."
14379,Homer,"my daughter, that's who!"
37838,Homer,"wait a minute... i knew you were a neat freak, skinner. but you beat your rug till it bleeds?"
19112,Homer,uh... to work for you?
18399,Homer,"and nobody's gonna take it away from me! you never had faith in me before. but let me tell you, the slim, lazy homer you knew is dead. now i'm a big fat dynamo. and where's that cake?"
39763,Homer,"okay. we've eaten, and eaten well. now, what else do we have to do? well, let's check the list your mom left us."
30386,Homer,"marge, what's happening to me?"
36732,Homer,on vacation he digs wells in darfur!
24251,Homer,all right! geez...

13169,Homer,i don't belong here!
22387,Homer,"don't confuse daddy, lisa."
22877,Homer,"no, no, andy, no!"
34908,Homer,you said nobody gets hurt. those were your exact words!
28540,Homer,ewww.
26210,Homer,"look, i married her, but that is as far as we went. we never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
36945,Homer,don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
38893,Homer,what about my family?
28387,Homer,"marge, please. i'm too upset to talk about it."
14808,Homer,now there's a machiavellian countenance.
31063,Homer,but what if we...
30262,Homer,me? but i'm the father.
23797,Homer,"we'll be fine, honey. the main thing is for you to get better."
26931,Homer,"flanders, i was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers."
24438,Homer,poor cyborganizer
14748,Homer,"now before we negotiate, i have to tell you i'm desperate to unload lurleen. and i'll take any offer."
14973,Homer,looks like we have a new champion.

41201,Homer,great. but don't tell her it was a favor to me. tell her she earned it.
21445,Homer,"hey, marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?"
27554,Homer,"well, i'm not opening the door."

40389,Homer,anybody can try! i want you to win!
30916,Homer,maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
19540,Homer,"no, i can't. this is my cause. i'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. what was his name? apollo creed?"
20076,Homer,i guess.

39321,Homer,"yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
19359,Homer,now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
38200,Homer,"what if i never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
27020,Homer,"you know, you're not helping."
38953,Homer,"get the ball, boy! c'mon!"
14957,Homer,"oooh, waffle run off."
31424,Homer,"what's the matter, son? don't you have enough money for ice cream?"
13445,Homer,"hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
38085,Homer,"no. i'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. but it's a church thing, so that's a given."
31164,Homer,"oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock."
34059,Homer,"if you fire me, i'll call president sarkozy and he'll be all over you like truffaut on hitchcock."
29421,Homer,"i could just wear gloves. nah, they're upstairs."
35288,Homer,"um, i uh, lied about having health insurance."

20650,Homer,"oh, marge, i don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish."
35431,Homer,"well, it might have been the time when..."
21944,Homer,"hang in there, son. i'm taking us out for our traditional sunday brunch."
37235,Homer,i wish grampa was my dad.
27342,Homer,"well, here's ours. we're going to disney world!"
36847,Homer,"i have a plan to deal with that. step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
39124,Homer,there's no guys! we haven't made any money.
36165,Homer,"i like to watch lamar odom play x-box while his giant wife yells at him. is that so nuts? huh? yeah, shut you up."
27182,Homer,"hey, gimme some of those blankets."
13392,Homer,i only did that a couple of times.
20769,Homer,"look at 'em standing out there. no place to go. heh, heh. poor guys. hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?"
35667,Homer,"okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a saturday surprise dad day."
27644,Homer,"hey, don't blame me, i voted for the green m&m."
39683,Homer,can i have some apple sauce?
38520,Homer,way heal away! / we'll heal away joe!
16239,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
31872,Homer,there must be another chair.
28618,Homer,uh...
14554,Homer,"kids, kids, kids. you can each get me a beer. but first let's see it again in super slow motion."
24442,Homer,"whee! touch the sky, maggie! whee! touch the sky!"
18702,Homer,yes.
37123,Homer,"listen to your sister, boy."
18382,Homer,i don't want to look like a weirdo. i'll just go with a muu-muu.
14035,Homer,"name your son's hobbies. building a soapbox racer... ""name your child's friends."" martin... martin! i'll curse that name 'til the day i die... huh? ""who is your son's heroe?""..."
20133,Homer,"oh no, it's getting dark. well, that's it. i'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!"
34216,Homer,oops -- the frisbee went into the bushes. why don't you go find it?
14835,Homer,i miss my couch.
20620,Homer,"""my name is luka, / i live on the second floor..."""
13906,Homer,"mr. burns, you do this personally?"
23213,Homer,just take one bite. if you're not one hundred per cent different...
39002,Homer,"not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!"
27082,Homer,"out of my way, nerdlinger."
13210,Homer,squeaky! squeaky!
14847,Homer,"well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
20552,Homer,i'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
32114,Homer,what's the point of putting my socks on? i just have to take them off again a week later.
23613,Homer,i can see i'm not needed here.
34072,Homer,stomp it! crush it! kill it!
39249,Homer,"nixon, comet, cupid... donna dixon."
30899,Homer,what's that delicious smell?
27036,Homer,"oh, yeah."
21089,Homer,"oh, will this horrible year never end?"
20737,Homer,"yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems."
40549,Homer,"w-well... it's a v-very generous offer, sir. but... his medical bills alone..."
26451,Homer,"mmmm, something smells delicious."
19716,Homer,"put a sock in it, roy."
23684,Homer,"okay, this is gettin' weird."
32168,Homer,leave her!
35767,Homer,"...so he says, ""bigamy is having one too many wives."" to which i replied, ""so's monogamy."""
25140,Homer,"comfy, isn't it?"
34001,Homer,to the panic room!
17265,Homer,moe! give me a beer!
40171,Homer,"'tis some visitor,"
20504,Homer,"hey, dad. i've come to spend some time with my favorite father."
36857,Homer,t-rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
34624,Homer,i got marge!
41516,Homer,geronimooo -- oh my god!
25126,Homer,"now, who's up for a trip to the library tomorrow? notice i no longer say ""liberry"" or ""tomorry""."
19631,Homer,i think they've stopped. .
22667,Homer,whoa! what's going on? ow! oh! this inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.
36658,Homer,that's one way to avoid drunk driving.
33123,Homer,i'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
15235,Homer,mmm... no.
22287,Homer,"hello, big maggie."
19025,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna die."
27999,Homer,everyone's against me.
25006,Homer,he's dead.
28696,Homer,open this door right now!
30961,Homer,"hmmm, let's see. you got the elephant man, johnny six-arms, papa smurf... these guys are pretty cool. maybe i am one of them. if only i had some kind of proof."
23829,Homer,"well, i think we're on the outs with him, but i know someone who's even holier than jesus."
38825,Homer,because jerk-ass homer has become ass-jerk homer.
18217,Homer,"hey, marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
29723,Homer,baaart!
14917,Homer,"marge, move it or lose it!"
30639,Homer,"mr. burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties."
18497,Homer,uh... maggie?
24876,Homer,i am not. or am i?
26329,Homer,i just poured myself a new glass of milk. the old one sat out for a little while. are you comin' to bed?
33871,Homer,"marge, i need some bribe money!"
18210,Homer,son of a bitch...
29491,Homer,i'm off!
23902,Homer,"this is my year, marge. everyone knows i'm what makes this city great."
13423,Homer,no.
29741,Homer,it's my money... i'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...
33639,Homer,"just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
18179,Homer,"what advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? which i could also afford."
19581,Homer,i'm here to see mr. ormand.
21653,Homer,"we're not rivals. we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. i can't destroy your work, my friend."
25846,Homer,huh?
23424,Homer,coming through... challenge... duel... hi lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...
28832,Homer,"oh, i'm so bored! maybe i'll clean out my wallet."
40598,Homer,fine. we'll go to mars.
29516,Homer,i'm happy!
27793,Homer,boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
34948,Homer,"oh, i get it. the government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
21995,Homer,"come on, come on, come on. start, damn you. start!"
37356,Homer,really? you wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
30592,Homer,i'm not!
34496,Homer,chief... me too.
16921,Homer,"son, you're okay! and you've led us to the precious ivory. and of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
38326,Homer,i'm back! comin' through!
30860,Homer,"lenny, this tv is amazing. if you're not careful, i might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
17908,Homer,"i was ashamed, marge. i failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, i was a b-plus dog. i'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
20127,Homer,"come on, boot guy!"
15448,Homer,hi.
17174,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
31489,Homer,"oh, of course. whatever you say, sweetie. nighty-night."
17670,Homer,"woo hoo! this is it! with this single glorious check, i'm finally completely out of debt."
38669,Homer,who is that?!
32394,Homer,the cornerstones of the brewish faith.
30491,Homer,is there a super bowl bunny?
32758,Homer,you're on your own.
21540,Homer,"this better work, boy. i don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
39333,Homer,"sorry, boy."
15722,Homer,"then, yes."
15666,Homer,woo hoo!
18948,Homer,they're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
25558,Homer,the simpsons are going to africa!
24878,Homer,"hey, moe, can you keep a secret?"
36606,Homer,"hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? then today will be nothing but beautiful memories."
30133,Homer,"but what are these wings? oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back."
15694,Homer,woo hoo!
34489,Homer,aw dang! i lost track of time! i'm gonna be late for work.
26898,Homer,no.
22283,Homer,touchdown!
31449,Homer,i'll never make it! unless...
24147,Homer,me homer. me hiding from pbs.
30653,Homer,did anyone order a hero?
40385,Homer,oh man. fine.
28840,Homer,"marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? i mean, who am i gonna complain about while i'm drinking?"
36614,Homer,"what's that, baby?"
20028,Homer,"see. and my son, bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
26675,Homer,"start inhalin', waylon."
29316,Homer,"yes, but he came here to die."
31222,Homer,"uh, no. sorry if it sounded like i did."
29531,Homer,"lenny, can i move you from wednesday at noon to sunday at six?"
25446,Homer,"man, he really hates wayne rogers."
13384,Homer,i see. i also understand bowling expressions.
23313,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""shake"" and ""bake."""
14205,Homer,don't worry. this castle is impregnable!
38046,Homer,do you have my money?
40492,Homer,bart!
40739,Homer,what?
16804,Homer,it was him!
33433,Homer,wait a minute...
25351,Homer,"so, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
38773,Homer,"well it's not enough anymore. when something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. look it up, it's called physics."
21972,Homer,okay...
15897,Homer,"maybe so, lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
40297,Homer,the duff brewery!
20547,Homer,lemme through! i got here late!
37075,Homer,"kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family."
19726,Homer,that is so true.
18015,Homer,oh my god! he's got the precious cable tv cable!
27042,Homer,"oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya..."
13300,Homer,"hey, just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't understand."
35720,Homer,it's not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head!
13354,Homer,so i said: i must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
15667,Homer,"uh, kind of. nobody makes a big deal out of valentine's day."
33269,Homer,"so... now that we're alone, um... death to america, right?"
33393,Homer,"marge, unlike c.p.r., this is something i must know."
13485,Homer,where's the letter?
19097,Homer,"oh yeah, that's right. let's watch this."
25971,Homer,"ooh, ooh, pick me!"
22756,Homer,"well, hel-lo!"
34566,Homer,"i'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! lisa, where were we?"
31454,Homer,marge? marge?
30467,Homer,forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
19928,Homer,can do.
41128,Homer,you'll be a bonehead. come on.
25105,Homer,"okay people, let's keep this short. we all want to get home to our families."
37688,Homer,"look at me, i'm afraid of dying!"
34145,Homer,"hmm... i'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""
19829,Homer,"take it like a man, boy. and do everything your little sister says."
18965,Homer,i'm just trying to party with you guys.
17775,Homer,i am holding still. i am squirming.
37241,Homer,"hello, police? i'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress."
17664,Homer,"the information super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""star trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
39759,Homer,what? but you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
22628,Homer,"ooh, anything spicy?"
30406,Homer,gladly.
15125,Homer,woo hoo! u.s.a! u.s.a! u.s.a!
32528,Homer,where's marge?
23136,Homer,it symbolizes that she's my property and i own her.
16863,Homer,all done.
17331,Homer,done and done.
17942,Homer,"no, my ears are really burning. i wanted to see inside, so i lit a q-tip."
28023,Homer,"thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, marge."
19679,Homer,"ooh, i can't get enough of this blood pudding."
23535,Homer,snooze... need more snooze.
19214,Homer,twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
22239,Homer,"i don't know, flanders, having two wives could have its advantages."
19171,Homer,the thing is -- oof! -- bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
33896,Homer,it's my moment.
21789,Homer,"yeah, tell you the truth, i'm not even sure."
24195,Homer,"oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. now i know how bob stupak feels."
21051,Homer,i want peas.
24432,Homer,"champagne, madame?"
13702,Homer,"i changed my mind. it was a passing fancy. although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
18321,Homer,"hey, shut up!"
16556,Homer,let me check my reason list.
33367,Homer,lenny! wake up!
23477,Homer,"oh, you're right. i'm a coward. i've made such a mess of things. if only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
36161,Homer,i wet the bed! the one embarrassing thing i've never done!
15616,Homer,hit me.
39692,Homer,oh no.
28100,Homer,"the noble chiefs outsmarted the treacherous cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. i shall bet no more forever."
31785,Homer,"oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!"
24540,Homer,... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! lenny?
35214,Homer,how 'bout don johnson?
41318,Homer,"kiss her already. what, are you chicken? bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok!"
28827,Homer,"oh my god! maggie, you're talking!"
34856,Homer,i thought he was an old clump of rags.
30347,Homer,"tragically, yes."
26736,Homer,this looks suspicious... but delicious!
40311,Homer,but they didn't care.
31765,Homer,used to?!
37322,Homer,i can't please any woman.
32694,Homer,twister! get down!
17049,Homer,"yeah, yeah. that'll eat up some time. uh, how 'bout you, otto."
41167,Homer,what a family.
25485,Homer,you...you really scared us.
14282,Homer,"oh, college boy, eh?"
35597,Homer,come on! god does crazy things! check your old testament.
26467,Homer,"aw, dad... we've got what people never get, a second chance."
25875,Homer,"come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
17898,Homer,you're really pushing it.
28767,Homer,that still sounds like the smart kid.
21621,Homer,"but it does break easily. now this next one's for the ladies. how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?"
24288,Homer,hey flanders? can your god do that?
19549,Homer,i kill me.
19446,Homer,"oh. you want me to climb that, huh? no problemo."
13447,Homer,"son, i'm proud of you. i was twice your age before i figured that out."
32953,Homer,we missed one!
31129,Homer,bart! hand me that sack of batteries!
25042,Homer,but what about the guy who took my car?
28773,Homer,"oh no, the giant is waking up!"
17635,Homer,woo hoo!
38413,Homer,"uh, nice night for a walk."
16286,Homer,you got real purdy hair.
29885,Homer,oh ray! you came at the agreed-upon time.
18882,Homer,"and have it sent to the springfield nuclear power plant, care of homer j.--"
33911,Homer,"i don't know if i can. i'm a yo-yo dieter: ""yo, hot dog man!"" ""yo, peanuts!"" why aren't you laughing? don't you know what ""yo"" means?"
32323,Homer,point one five.
35294,Homer,"oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
16065,Homer,woo hoo! a flyer for a hardware store!
39350,Homer,"is that one fat enough for you, son?"
25222,Homer,"son, i know it hurts. i still remember my first lifetime banning..."
24875,Homer,no!
19570,Homer,ow! oh! call work and tell 'em i won't be in tomorrow.
31790,Homer,i wanted to remember my place in the book i was reading.
13321,Homer,holy-moly... talk about parenting!
19656,Homer,"didn't he lisa? didn't he? hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
35914,Homer,goodnight and good gravy.
17548,Homer,all right. how much do you charge?
33809,Homer,"yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing i can do as a parent is simply check out."
21307,Homer,uhh... don't you have anything healthy here?
18608,Homer,thanks.
14898,Homer,sounds interesting.
22529,Homer,"not so fast, apu!"
14588,Homer,we always have one good kid and one lousy kid. why can't both our kids be good?
36711,Homer,doodie.
15465,Homer,can i have a free calendar?
15972,Homer,"well... if i explain it to marge that way, i'm sure she'll understand."
40828,Homer,"hey, flanders. who put that bug up your butt?"
29002,Homer,quick -- we can hide in here!
24926,Homer,i'm sorry. what?
27724,Homer,"it's the sound of a go-getter at work, marge. look, i installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are."
38011,Homer,maggie?!
21518,Homer,woo hoo!
26242,Homer,"fine, i'll just play the banjo with this cobra."
20976,Homer,"oh. but... you run it, right?"
27974,Homer,hmm... needs beer.
14258,Homer,wowww.
28983,Homer,"and look at me, i'm reading ""the economist."" did you know indonesia is at a crossroads?"
25651,Homer,my thumb!
27235,Homer,"why, it says here that president cleveland has..."
37784,Homer,"goodbye, homer junior. i guess you're the man of the house now. and never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
39176,Homer,one am lovin' and two am steak? night marriage rules! i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
18373,Homer,i need a miracle.
38009,Homer,"solitaire, top hats on ebay, angry birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...lenny doing carl's clown makeup."
13297,Homer,"bart didn't get one vote?! oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. what are you so mopey about?"
18430,Homer,pressure too high?
28627,Homer,affirmative.
41076,Homer,"no, my cookie!"
16260,Homer,"marge, i got sprayed by this skunk! oh look, it's doing it again!"
24103,Homer,"marge, we're trying to help ned."
13717,Homer,"oh, it's all my fault."
22717,Homer,ten hours?! we gotta roll!
23482,Homer,of course not. but you know something? sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
31805,Homer,"ten and two, einstein!"
38703,Homer,"hello? hello? this is homer simpson! 742 evergreen terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! and my pretty, pretty wife!"
32858,Homer,"we can't wait to see it, sweetie."
39513,Homer,"surely, lisa. you see how it works, bart? a cupcake here, a good grade there."
23887,Homer,"oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, marge?"
21617,Homer,probably needs to be more powerful.
29644,Homer,"dad, where's your base?!"
30224,Homer,"marge, relax. i've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
39142,Homer,"oh, uh, i will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. shut your eyes."
26403,Homer,you will too!
14413,Homer,"oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. i gotta get outta here."
40254,Homer,"oh, no. marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
19461,Homer,"hey, wait! come back!..."
13290,Homer,why you little...
38091,Homer,i call all music mozart!
26880,Homer,let's just say i'm planning a little surprise for the execution. this cannon is going to be full when i go off. ka-boom!
29593,Homer,not her! she'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
13154,Homer,an eye patch? but i've got a date tonight!
22350,Homer,my friends...
31029,Homer,"seventy-four? oh sorry, there's been a mistake."
14455,Homer,mmm. strained peas.
31040,Homer,when will marge remember us?
38029,Homer,"that's ""fake name."""
21288,Homer,"if god didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin."
16057,Homer,"katharine hepburn's ""me""?"
25914,Homer,why you little...
14823,Homer,"oh, goodbye, old girl. we've had a lot of great memories."
35393,Homer,not a good time.
17399,Homer,"do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
40382,Homer,"how about this henny penny? if bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn."
32259,Homer,"aw, please, give me a break. i've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids."
30171,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i've taken every precaution."
26075,Homer,"well, this is my house. ah--"
37025,Homer,and it still works!
38975,Homer,okay.
40133,Homer,so we got a good deal for once. quit fighting it.
20632,Homer,"oh, santa's got a little trick up his sleeve."
37582,Homer,you're so beautiful when i cut you off in the middle of a question.
20925,Homer,"""stealing, stealing / stealing a car for moe / dada dada dada dada / insurance fraud today..."""
39494,Homer,"whoops. sorry, i wasn't paying attention."
15467,Homer,i can't afford it. maybe i should buy one of those machines.
21688,Homer,"ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? and would it kill you to make some coffee?"
31755,Homer,where is he? i know he's in here.
14792,Homer,"i don't care. this is not ""happy days"" and he is not the fonz."
28683,Homer,"apu, do you sell crazy straws? i've got a guy with a broken back and i'm tryin' to cheer him up."
22112,Homer,milking room? i hope you cows are decent.
24807,Homer,"you see, that's what i'm saying."
32642,Homer,no. but you're close.
24975,Homer,i could ask you the very same question.
13204,Homer,"it hurts! it hurts so bad! please, just put one in my brain!"
38473,Homer,"now come on, give daddy a hug."
27487,Homer,it's not fair. i always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
33913,Homer,"hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones."
21321,Homer,"well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?"
34430,Homer,"i'm more than okay! i am the messiah, come to save the world! look upon me and shudder!"
31525,Homer,"marge, i have no idea what you were just thinking about. why would you think i did?"
23990,Homer,anybody care what this guy thinks?
25429,Homer,albuquerque isotopes? what is all this stuff?
13213,Homer,i lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat. but i found a kitten.
19758,Homer,"all right, boy! come on! today we're gonna--"
19777,Homer,has the whole world gone insane?
18037,Homer,"marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
13987,Homer,hank... jones.
23953,Homer,what have you done with my party guests?
13875,Homer,no.
13292,Homer,i do!
16009,Homer,yeah.
17845,Homer,"really? look, boy! now i'm in australia! now i'm in america!"
40790,Homer,fenetre.
22129,Homer,"oh, don't worry about that, boy. he's already out on bail. well, i'm off to work."
27875,Homer,tennessee williams?! but how did he survive in the world of theater?
26837,Homer,"oh no, i crushed that horrible bug. what should i do?"
34745,Homer,can you tell me when this is gonna be on? i'm thinking of having a party.
35419,Homer,and these keys are from all my jobs.
31683,Homer,hm... what's changed for me since the last time i saw you? only... everything!
17550,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. first, what are your qualifications?"
29175,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to dance on his grave."
19310,Homer,"g'night... thanks for coming... we'll see you... ba-bye... well, i think that went pretty well."
20008,Homer,"i wish i had a nickel for every time i've heard that. take me out to the ball game / take me out to the ball! so what's new, grimy?"
14305,Homer,"listen, boy, this is a great invention! watch."
21383,Homer,lisa!
30545,Homer,"today marks a new dawn for springfield. this salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" and those eggs are ready to hatch!"
31341,Homer,i wonder what makes us so special.
15805,Homer,marge!
29101,Homer,"hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
40525,Homer,take that you dumb squirrel.
19961,Homer,"in that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. lousy god."
39062,Homer,"okay, okay. standing o or die!"
20993,Homer,"""hi, this is jerry maguire. show me the message. show me the message."""
33446,Homer,oh yeah.
26712,Homer,i hate them so much!
22683,Homer,"oooh, i'll have that one. and to drink... ... meatballs."
35951,Homer,"lisa, you were right! i'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!"
13783,Homer,"but i really can't tell them anything, sir."
26982,Homer,"i mean, four!"
21557,Homer,marge! i've wasted half my life.
20398,Homer,"i'm sorry i lied to you, marge. but this gun had a hold on me. i felt this incredible surge of power, like god must feel when he's holding a gun. so please, get rid of it, because i know i'll just lie to you again and again!"
20033,Homer,would you like to see my grammy award?
27721,Homer,learn to talk!
33964,Homer,ask him.
17449,Homer,faucet's jammed into my back... i'm stuck.
25311,Homer,"it's obvious what's happening. i'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me."
25411,Homer,"oh, how clumsy of me? and..."
22490,Homer,"i'm picking it up. ""sala"" seems to mean jerk. and i think ""manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
14918,Homer,salt me.
27698,Homer,everyone but me.
22428,Homer,"and it doesn't stop in the bedroom. oh no, i'm taking charge. kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the max power way."
24776,Homer,that's the sneeze guard. you have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
16051,Homer,bart!
14537,Homer,softball?
29035,Homer,"oh, i think you'd find his filling extremely hot."
36962,Homer,what the hell was that?
23005,Homer,don't look! don't look! don't look!
19509,Homer,skoal! wait a minute -- this is duff!
28145,Homer,get out!
27441,Homer,"emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body."
40478,Homer,"i can and do. go to your room, bart! there, i've done it. i'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all."
20510,Homer,"oh, the hell with her. hester. emil. prudence. lemuel. increase. dad."
40721,Homer,"shut up, boy. cheap chinese tvs... why did i every buy... is that better?"
19124,Homer,"tom landry's hat! and it's autographed! ""to berman's dry cleaning, best wishes, tom landry."""
13985,Homer,"uh, let's see, bart's friends... well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
16793,Homer,"hey everybody, here comes fun!"
15657,Homer,this is even more painful than it looks.
39392,Homer,"boy, this intersection is dangerous! someone ought to put a stop sign here."
35016,Homer,fit tony took his cousin's place running the springfield mob.
25480,Homer,"this coffee's good, huh?"
38418,Homer,mmmm--
38289,Homer,feels weird.
18103,Homer,"whuh! marge, not here. hey, you're not really arresting me...?"
25066,Homer,"wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles."
15411,Homer,i like those odds.
28111,Homer,well i'm not finished. where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
16759,Homer,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
25242,Homer,what funny names.
20421,Homer,you never use it.
17448,Homer,n -- -- yes. but please don't you say that word.
35608,Homer,this is where we get our coffee. just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. the burning smell will let them know.
40746,Homer,nothing.
18410,Homer,the mail! the mail is here!
14640,Homer,"oh, you mean tonight."
40083,Homer,hello?
28593,Homer,what the hell is this?
40978,Homer,"oh, sorry."
41088,Homer,"uh, you can pick him up tomorrow."
25763,Homer,"'cause the thing is, there are no bad kids..."
29971,Homer,"that freeloading fatso! marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
30796,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait..."
24853,Homer,hmmmmm.
17077,Homer,huh?
14032,Homer,sorry.
24129,Homer,mm-mm.
18038,Homer,lousy teachers. trying to palm off our kids on us.
15788,Homer,woo hoo!
19010,Homer,"thank you! and remember: don't trust anyone over thirty. and now, peter frampton!"
15706,Homer,no.
41564,Homer,"razorblade of apathy / shave me with your irony / shave me, shave me..."
31144,Homer,"wow, i think we've really hit on something here. unfortunately, we're out of time. how does that make you feel?"
25715,Homer,"oh, yeah. now i remember it like it was yesterday..."
30838,Homer,sad? you're crazy. i feel like i'm at the oscars for the animals i forgot existed.
26178,Homer,they told me it would be like this on the outside.
39931,Homer,"well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed..."
15066,Homer,yeah! clean up this stink hole!
36220,Homer,woo hoo! thank god it's t.g.i.f!
25762,Homer,don't film this.
26916,Homer,do you sell hats?
30275,Homer,uh-oh. that might have broken the phone. i'd better call moe.
34791,Homer,the pie you baked us killed that shark!
13152,Homer,"ooh, a switchblade. i see the switch, but where's the blade?"
30482,Homer,sweet home alabama...
36964,Homer,"i guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show."
19061,Homer,"see, marge? who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
19233,Homer,"hiding out? marge, you've been reading too many hideout books."
25572,Homer,help! kitenge!
31985,Homer,i'm lost and i'm starving!
36443,Homer,"ooh, nice and roomy. our lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool."
21267,Homer,who can take your trash out? / stomp it down for you? / shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy too? / the garbage man...
35912,Homer,"zoomy, zoomy, zoomy dateline, nebraska."
31932,Homer,mm-hm.
27371,Homer,drunk cop? is that you?
27827,Homer,i can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
29826,Homer,"listen to me! this whole building is unsafe. they cut corners everywhere. people, it's a death trap!"
19800,Homer,"son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- gaahhh!!"
39476,Homer,"why, you... here's five you haven't met."
33830,Homer,"heads. i mean, tails. i mean, on its side."
27335,Homer,i wouldn't have it any other way.
13628,Homer,free food?!
24801,Homer,am i glad to see you guys. you gotta call...
32756,Homer,"i thought this might happen, so i brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
16645,Homer,"aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about urkel... that little snot. boy i'd like to smack that kid."
39358,Homer,"well, i bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. come on, son."
34875,Homer,the hangman's here!
27100,Homer,what the hell are you doing here?
30450,Homer,"well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
35316,Homer,"pretty sweet, eh boy?"
29228,Homer,"and to make sure we get there super fast, i'm hitting all the buttons with my palm."
34310,Homer,so that's why i love drinking so much.
28644,Homer,i gotta get a job before marge finds out i was fired.
32595,Homer,this is great! i must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
20393,Homer,"it's gone for good, marge. i finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
29211,Homer,it sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
28485,Homer,"may the spirit of retsin be with you all year long. god bless god, amen."
16965,Homer,"give it a try. it's like kissing a peanut. heh, heh, heh."
27665,Homer,make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.
26974,Homer,i'm gonna need help with this.
22836,Homer,"woo hoo! look, marge, my first sale! in your face, jasper johns!"
40927,Homer,sorry.
14009,Homer,but you can use me. i'm good. i've built a lot of things around the house... the spice rack... the birdfeeder... the gymboree.
29481,Homer,you do?
36436,Homer,"maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories..."
32255,Homer,"yeah, it's paint."
25350,Homer,"y'ello!... hey, moe. we're watching you on tv."
32262,Homer,"wow, i'd really like to meet this guy."
41394,Homer,goodbye!
39316,Homer,get outta here.
32652,Homer,your mother and i were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.
13664,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders! i'm wishing as fast as i can!"
35548,Homer,hey! wha?! wha?! wha?!
29370,Homer,"okay! you be the girl, and i'll be the car."
37364,Homer,"probably one of bart's dirty friends! boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
21927,Homer,that's it! somehow!
23957,Homer,"oh, that would be just... you're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?"
21193,Homer,hey wait! stop! i have garbage!
19412,Homer,"what's wrong with you? what are you trying to hide from m-- what's that smell? onions... chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck... it's chili! oh my god, i'm missing the chili cook-off!"
25438,Homer,...thank you for coming. the proof that the isotopes are moving to albuquerque is right behind this door.
29345,Homer,"chief, my daughter's up there. you're a father too."
29798,Homer,"really? you mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?"
40122,Homer,"are you kidding? i'm stuck in that dead-end job again. the kids are gonna hate me cause i can't buy them all that stuff i promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause i'm ugly and bald."
26560,Homer,no way. i still haven't lost the weight i put on from the last one.
22139,Homer,"all right, fat tony. if it's trouble with quimby you're after--"
31182,Homer,"sorry, marge, can't hear ya!"
33657,Homer,i love to see this!
33045,Homer,"eh, he won't get far. not on the crappy breakfast i made for him."
16669,Homer,you're selling what now?
40659,Homer,"yeah, that's more like it! ""oh, i want to be in that rumba / when the saints go over there.... over there... over there."""
29948,Homer,on the radio?
32461,Homer,a smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
33918,Homer,a montage of me turning a ragtag little league team into state runners-up?
20202,Homer,nah.
35298,Homer,can't hurt the boy. can't hurt the boy.
25319,Homer,that's the guy! that's the guy from my dream!
25275,Homer,i've got it! it's in the bag!
34274,Homer,pack your winter coat! we're going to canada's warmest city!
18996,Homer,i'm fine.
24023,Homer,and what if i refuse to lose?
23755,Homer,where are the refreshments?
40964,Homer,"i know, he could be anywhere! that's why i want you to narrow it down! please..."
25336,Homer,booo! you rot!
16022,Homer,i got ya.
24565,Homer,really?
36507,Homer,"boy, if anyone needs me i'll be taking a popcorn bath. it's a thing i read about in a men's health magazine in a dream."
15380,Homer,"dad, i don't need advice, i need $15,000 to buy a home."
16002,Homer,and i did.
36974,Homer,"honey, everything's fine. there's nothing to worry about."
38885,Homer,i'd like rabbit. lots of rabbit.
32711,Homer,i'll bet no man would touch you.
30169,Homer,what's this? goodbye springfield...
22596,Homer,"well, marge?"
21202,Homer,"so long, chicken bone."
31517,Homer,he sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
39418,Homer,"i can't do it, mr. burns."
37227,Homer,no i don't. if you pray to superman.
26624,Homer,"but isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"
36602,Homer,just appreciating how lucky i am to be with you.
31306,Homer,"marge, to keep you in my life, i'd do anything. there must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community."
19968,Homer,"c'mon, christmas tree."
39071,Homer,what the?
26591,Homer,gimme a drink with all your sweetest brazilian fruits mixed together.
15889,Homer,not me!
34687,Homer,yeah. now what am i supposed to do?
28246,Homer,how do you figure?
39241,Homer,"thanks, moe."
31908,Homer,woo hoo!
38023,Homer,"marmaduke was horrible today! also, marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
28438,Homer,sweet.
22748,Homer,"this is red barclay's shipment. on time, as always."
17018,Homer,woo hoo!
13291,Homer,me concur.
38701,Homer,skunk canyon?
30111,Homer,woo hoo! i was right!
40003,Homer,"oh, these things are heavy."
25283,Homer,"how embarrassing. you take over, bart."
26803,Homer,"aww, she must have dreamt about hitler again."
21644,Homer,"aw, to hell with him!"
14654,Homer,easy... easy... how'm i doing on the right?
22655,Homer,and a ooga-booga to you too.
38032,Homer,no need. everything's fine.
16442,Homer,arr - see ya tomorrow.
21427,Homer,"but marge, the gilded truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
33545,Homer,can't someone help me with this puzzle?
29939,Homer,what are you talking about?
17934,Homer,call off the debt?
33488,Homer,"yeah, you'd treat her right."
31273,Homer,the truth is that i'm perfect and everything i touch is perfect!
17158,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i've learned my lesson. a mountain of sugar is too much for one man. it's clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii."
17105,Homer,"marge, look at me! we've been separated for a day, and i'm as dirty as a frenchman. in another few hours, i'll be dead. i can't afford to lose your trust again."
30579,Homer,psst. psst!
22870,Homer,with ham!
13343,Homer,go to bed.
30198,Homer,the smoke will wake us up.
28376,Homer,this is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. dig in!
35923,Homer,"death to america! i mean, over here."
27319,Homer,frank grimes...
19056,Homer,"attic? oh, that's silly. seriously, though, don't ever go up there."
41119,Homer,"miss, i'm looking for abe simpson."
35721,Homer,i demand to speak to my paleontologist!
24930,Homer,"huh, that was easy."
13562,Homer,okay. five times nine.
27257,Homer,"wow. marge, i think i figured out their primitive language!"
22746,Homer,woo hoo!
15644,Homer,he's my little brother. that's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
26470,Homer,tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
30230,Homer,"face it, marge -- catholics rule. we've got boston, south america, the good part of ireland, and we're making serious inroads in mozambique, baby!"
28531,Homer,"marge, do you want this last pork chop?"
40370,Homer,"now, this is a picture of your enemy, todd flanders. every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him."
24581,Homer,anything to get out of work.
28391,Homer,hello? anyone home?
20640,Homer,"well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: god hates us."
39895,Homer,"hey, lenny. does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?"
36099,Homer,friends are the only people you can betray! and you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
34070,Homer,i can't take it anymore!
34263,Homer,dude...
39419,Homer,"hmm. when you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. but that's the lug you're looking at. and i vow to continue spending every free minute i have crusading for safety. of course, i'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
27513,Homer,"ooh, you coughed up some dry wall."
28442,Homer,the door? now i'll never get to pee.
22872,Homer,i'm just gonna rest for a minute.
40696,Homer,"guys, keep it down. i got some last words. i never told you this before, but sometimes when i'm at work, i think of you and smile. so often i think that ... oh, words won't do it. i love you, moe."
28092,Homer,"look at me, i'm brian epstein!"
22986,Homer,"look, i got runner-up prize."
38887,Homer,yes! this mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. so long you stupid slobbering... what the?
20284,Homer,it was your mother.
17237,Homer,"yoo hoo, mr. robot..."
31617,Homer,ew! silver!
21581,Homer,go school!
36297,Homer,"oh, this is the life."
40388,Homer,"look, son, all i'm asking is that you try."
30415,Homer,"i'm a-comin', boy!"
26091,Homer,"hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! well i can fantasize too."
32793,Homer,"so i say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money."
35782,Homer,"ah, mr. mayor! more peanut nore?"
32341,Homer,"moe the tavern, not moe the person."
37169,Homer,"highlights... ""for..."""
14042,Homer,"do it for your old man, boy!"
22642,Homer,yes it is.
37701,Homer,"what happened to us, eduardo? we had so many things we were going to do."
15227,Homer,he left his briefcase. hey! it's full of shredded newspapers.
31946,Homer,woo hoo!
13863,Homer,"you know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
18048,Homer,really? wow.
25597,Homer,help! bad monkey!
35173,Homer,and there's something else it might be good for.
29537,Homer,"this is either about me, or steroids."
40081,Homer,"gotta run, marge. can't be late."
19083,Homer,"oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
39219,Homer,"what do you think, kids?"
21296,Homer,time out... t... time out...
33214,Homer,uh... the sun did that.
30940,Homer,oh no! i took a job on the other side of the world!
21562,Homer,"oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that."
20729,Homer,oh. bart?
24632,Homer,read my lips: yes.
35722,Homer,a million bucks?
14872,Homer,"wake up, boy."
21909,Homer,ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. i brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
17177,Homer,"well, this is my floor."
14716,Homer,no!
19092,Homer,of course not. i wouldn't do that. why not?
38617,Homer,"laundry. homework. pranks. poop, poop and poop."
22790,Homer,"hey, look! oh, they're out of hot dogs! and the cole slaw has pineapple in it! german potato salad!"
13818,Homer,"forget it, you two. as the pants- wearer of this house, i get the first wish."
18746,Homer,lisa?
37550,Homer,hall and oates? what's going on here?!
37938,Homer,"oh that's hollywood fantasy. we live in the real world, where i have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."

28601,Homer,wait a minute. what is it my dad always said to me?
23709,Homer,"this gang's for rebels, flanders, not conformos."
39839,Homer,"okay. your wish is my command, my little..."
14004,Homer,i've never been afraid of a little hard work.
37974,Homer,really? don't you ever look up at the sky?
38384,Homer,beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
25526,Homer,"well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home."

35919,Homer,"great question. i know you children have never seen your father cry before... marge, do we have any more gravy?"
16380,Homer,stupid poetic justice...!
31795,Homer,"see marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
13226,Homer,yes indeedy.
27180,Homer,did you label the meals so i can tell which is which?
37619,Homer,both sold to me by apu this morning.
15267,Homer,"but marge, i think he should learn about it the same way i did."

39975,Homer,"out, boy, out."
27877,Homer,did you ever get the parody songs i sent you?

29487,Homer,"well, i can go all night, baby. i could listen to you two, maybe three, times."
35633,Homer,"since i got demoted i have to show my i.d., but the picture was taken so long ago i put on a lot of weight, so i have to stretch out my face and say ""i used to look like this..."""

23584,Homer,did somebody say a perfect game?
19473,Homer,okay.
20527,Homer,c'mon. you shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
33680,Homer,"i can too! ""there once was this guy from an island off the coast of massachusetts... uh, nantucket, i think it was. anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
23308,Homer,always.
15581,Homer,yes.
14121,Homer,well... how are you?
15884,Homer,false.
16212,Homer,hey boy!
15670,Homer,perhaps this might be appropriate.
13155,Homer,"all right, how should i get there?"
31031,Homer,"son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, entertainment weekly. now, for once, i'm getting' rich-person mail. you wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?"
36934,Homer,he still has my sweatshirt.
40709,Homer,"goodbye, bart -- i like your sheets."

34193,Homer,"c'mon, line, move! maybe it'll speed up if i make ""can you believe this"" noises. oh for goodness sake--"
36574,Homer,"hey, marge."
16280,Homer,sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
23928,Homer,"marge, you're right. we do have to have a party."
37951,Homer,i will help you. as long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
15999,Homer,we all went our separate ways.
14945,Homer,don' wanna go.
16738,Homer,"respect?! nooo! it was me! i made the crank call. i do it all the time. check with the fbi, i have a file. i have a fiiiiile."
19329,Homer,"""dear homer,"" aww. ""sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. i left you hot dogs for dinner. they're thawing in the sink."""
33592,Homer,"well, dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an irishman?"
38985,Homer,ooh! i've missed you too.
40604,Homer,no!
26370,Homer,"my life here is over. lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?"

14557,Homer,you play right field.
22289,Homer,"oh, my god! look what those rotten kids did to my car!"
25496,Homer,good times.
31736,Homer,how could my dad go out with selma? don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?
40546,Homer,uh-oh...
16432,Homer,"hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze."
40843,Homer,hear me roar -- the network for women.
19935,Homer,rats. i almost had him eating dog food.
37644,Homer,you're gonna be sorry you said that.
32902,Homer,she said i didn't suck?
32648,Homer,i thought global warming would take care of it. al gore can't do anything right.
39114,Homer,at last.
40568,Homer,i'll tell you what i think. i think he thinks i'm an idiot. the only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
17768,Homer,i can't get the... i can't get the door closed. somebody's going to have to get out.
34345,Homer,whatever. knock yourself out.
28746,Homer,why you little...!
26407,Homer,"wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
35670,Homer,"marge, the kids are acting ethnic!"

23182,Homer,"i'm tired of running away. did ""braveheart"" run away? did ""payback"" run away? it's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
28364,Homer,twenty on the trifecta?
23952,Homer,pirates! are you friendly pirates?
36603,Homer,"and let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
29242,Homer,"a walk-in microwave! hey marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
13339,Homer,bart! come over here.
33252,Homer,"up-bup-bup! don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
29862,Homer,i wouldn't ruin a surprise for lenny.
39535,Homer,"awright, you kids, keep it down! am i making myself... ?"
31708,Homer,he's lying!
19372,Homer,i would make it my business to be a third wheel.
32058,Homer,the happiness swept me away!
21102,Homer,well...
40641,Homer,"ah, watch the sunrise."
31635,Homer,"no, sweetie. the lesson is: never put down your weapon."
35948,Homer,congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes... no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other staaaate...
27850,Homer,"kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
21079,Homer,es mi dia primero. wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo quack quack quack.
30503,Homer,i still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. it's my day.

22762,Homer,"no, you're too kind. and wise, and righteous... i can't believe you don't have a girlfriend."
32359,Homer,how could you not tell me?
17424,Homer,"i like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. i know - ""evening at the improv."" they never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
32829,Homer,"ooh, laughter house! with the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy."
14274,Homer,the hospital?
40653,Homer,ah! ooh! arg! son of a -- ! ah! and that's how we shave.

27385,Homer,on the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
26696,Homer,"while i wait for my family, i'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss."
15505,Homer,"i know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man."
39896,Homer,sector twelve?
20814,Homer,of course not! except that we're all moving to the movementarian agricultural compound to be near the leader and serve him.
24536,Homer,the simpsons are going to delaware!
33718,Homer,"ooh, fire-kebab!"
36695,Homer,dad!

36812,Homer,"beat it, ducks! i'm not old enough to have food for you! i'm sexy! young and sexy!"
36186,Homer,"marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside."
22024,Homer,nothing's too good for me.
14049,Homer,"what is it, boy?"
30226,Homer,transubstantiation!
32393,Homer,there are so many choices. bolo? clip on? piano keys? ten commandments of beer?
19820,Homer,"marge, i'm going to look for the kids!"
17798,Homer,"i'm beat, and after work i've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the ace awards."
32320,Homer,why you little...
33338,Homer,"oh, that. we were actually just going out for brunch and i got lost. but don't worry, officer. we'll definitely have a talk with the boy."
14818,Homer,"oh, the usual. stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
28702,Homer,uh-huh.
37682,Homer,why does everyone know?!
29821,Homer,"hold on a minute. governor, i've been using my powers of snitching for evil. but now i want to tattle for good. this prison is a hellhole. they feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!"
30336,Homer,"lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as i have, consistency is something, something that, something i love you, bart."
33297,Homer,"worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!"
32123,Homer,is this going somewhere?
16179,Homer,"maggie, i know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!"
38270,Homer,but i did learn something from all this. the sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
32786,Homer,"now practice preening to the crowd, el guapo."
33621,Homer,"marge, this time i'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. let's get out of here!"
17055,Homer,"no, that's not what i meant. marge and i always talk things over in bed. like the other night we were fighting about money."
30142,Homer,"come on flanders, doesn't that ""bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? why won't you love me?"
38221,Homer,"what do you think, sweetie?"
21773,Homer,"heads up. comin' through. look out! hey, volley ball. can i play later? hi, apu."

29045,Homer,"so it would seem. anyhoo, i'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? mild-mannered homer simpson..."
35958,Homer,really? that made sense? then i'm definitely doing it.
14624,Homer,"oh. well, thanks for your time."
26978,Homer,"wow, four of me. i think this could be a magic hammock. and it just might be the answer to my problems."
18558,Homer,"i've figured out the boy's punishment. first: he's grounded. no leaving the house, not even for school. second: no eggnog. in fact, no nog period. and third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
13898,Homer,"now lady, i'm buying this pony for my little girl, and i don't care what it costs."
39485,Homer,that's it? that's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
16147,Homer,i mean... you know... mr. burns... is so... old...
38454,Homer,"no, you're a-wrong!"
30609,Homer,"shock and awe, losers! shock and awe!"
32503,Homer,"mr. doobner, i have a complaint: i work hard, and when i go out with my family, i expect a certain level of basic--"
38646,Homer,"we'll have to set a trap, bait. i mean, bart."
22824,Homer,uh-oh.

36883,Homer,i did it! i did it! i man-hugged!
34897,Homer,"oh, that's pretty sure. subscription rate, right?"
33969,Homer,"ultimate punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. studies have shown your mother is right."
17344,Homer,with her.
27237,Homer,perfect.
21546,Homer,"well, here goes..."
15332,Homer,"oh, you want the mister plow who plows driveways. this is tony plow. you know... from ""leave it to beaver""? yeah, they were gay."

20842,Homer,"internet, eh?"
14068,Homer,try lighting it on fire.
28551,Homer,"let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. but we're probably right. amen."
34245,Homer,"boy, this has gone too far -- i quit! as soon as i finish these oats."
18460,Homer,some people say i look like dan aykroyd. i can't believe you're here. dad always told me you died while i was at the movies.
14908,Homer,"match point, homer."
14304,Homer,bart! i would love to get a present like that.
32501,Homer,"next time a commercial comes on, i'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as i can."
32060,Homer,"marge, the couch is lumpy!"
32586,Homer,a life well-lived. until last night. i guess i'll have to watch that now.
19797,Homer,"bart, i'm gonna turn my back -- and when i turn around, i wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
16730,Homer,"no, the batteries!"
24469,Homer,"why? it's just a cute little weasel. hello there, mister weasel."
19707,Homer,"i'll field this one. let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""genius at work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
14527,Homer,"oh, marge. i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted to hear."
20576,Homer,"ahh, i love these real saturdays. they're so relaxing. not like that fake saturday that almost got me fired."
19369,Homer,"what is it, boy? fire? earthquake? hippies?"
21121,Homer,"why do you keep picking on me? marge's name was on that tax return, too."
28308,Homer,"marge, i'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. now let's see, which rifle should i bring?"
18871,Homer,"moe thinks he knows a lot more than moe knows! well, just give me another chance, and i'll prove i can keep your secrets."
31494,Homer,angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
19371,Homer,"oh, i'm sure i'd be a third wheel."
38827,Homer,i made everyone happy but me. some christmas. feliz navidad.
13308,Homer,"no, no, no. i just wish i knew what to say."
31385,Homer,"there once was a rapping tomato / that's right, i said rapping tomato / he rapped all day / from april to may / and also, guess what, it was me."
19453,Homer,"if it's about laying off the insanity peppers, i'm way ahead of you."
37499,Homer,yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
32839,Homer,what could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
19213,Homer,"yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
18918,Homer,hey... how come my pay is so low?
15907,Homer,"well, marge,"
38772,Homer,they're not juicy. my licks are dry. dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
18624,Homer,"marge, that's the rhinestone nights fashion gun. i need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
25095,Homer,absolutely.
34065,Homer,"marge, i believe we have a little unfinished business. come with me!"
34859,Homer,or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
24355,Homer,"""yes."" ""are you a good lover?"" ""yes."" oh, i'm doin' great!"
19881,Homer,"hey, banner, how's it hangin'?"

21913,Homer,"what's in your brand new bag, mama?"
19649,Homer,"marge, i was just watching women's volleyball on espn..."
41572,Homer,of course. the thing that stood between us -- the nineties -- is almost over.
34285,Homer,"i'll do it myself. when we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
15029,Homer,c'mon.
38323,Homer,i'm number two!
34610,Homer,"god created the devil? finally, he did something cool."
16038,Homer,nope.
40270,Homer,"i should have slept on it. or at least stared blankly for a while. perhaps if i'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."
25793,Homer,"man, buffalo are easy to kill."
21962,Homer,"eat, eat! you're nothing but skin and bones."
28789,Homer,"okay kids, forget the movie. we'll just go to the furniture store and sit down."
37084,Homer,"okay, take whatever time you need. i just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians."
27039,Homer,"well, moe..."
39484,Homer,"oh, come on, marge. why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
30837,Homer,i am gonna get them so wet.
30035,Homer,"his name isn't cameron anymore. he's now ""johnny rainbow."""
20685,Homer,"they're singing! they're singing, marge! why aren't they killing each other?"
30514,Homer,"okay, lisa. time for daddy's big surprise!"
26233,Homer,"she said ""tavern"". i'm going to moe's!"
26167,Homer,i did it. i found our dog. now our christmas is complete.
39846,Homer,"i also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. i want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
27991,Homer,"now let me think. how did that beautiful young naked lady in ""jaws"" make it out alive?"
33701,Homer,"you know, i think milhouse is ""el barto."" hmmmm."
38608,Homer,some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. but what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
13574,Homer,were you out of gas?
19113,Homer,um... someday i'd like to own the dallas cowboys.
35618,Homer,why would a homer humiliator do this to me?
38463,Homer,out of my reach? must... make... effort...
40803,Homer,i'm her date.
15128,Homer,"eight o'clock... happy days. the fonz, henry winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."

39733,Homer,"good going, son. but remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice."
16496,Homer,"hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day."
23840,Homer,i figured it out after i ate one of my chest sores.
26670,Homer,"unregardless, i will no longer be a slave to this."
38717,Homer,this place is great. just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
27009,Homer,"you mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?"
22658,Homer,oh no. no freezing.
35501,Homer,"some may say / i don't deserve any pay, but hey / i came up with ""sixties day"""
30203,Homer,"no meat?! what do they eat, light bulbs?"
21165,Homer,mind if i take him for a ride?
40357,Homer,never mind!
38496,Homer,"c'mon, lick it!"
15365,Homer,he'll tire himself out soon.
36222,Homer,well... i didn't really feel like going to moe's today... thought i might hang out here for as long as i can take it.
38748,Homer,"r ""o"" ""k"" ""c""."
27126,Homer,"oh. okay. so i'll, uh... okay."
20996,Homer,"you're the man, ralph!"
32034,Homer,here we go... here we go.
28973,Homer,"so, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?"
20587,Homer,can you believe it? it's already been a year.
23282,Homer,"how about ""screw flanders""?"
31354,Homer,"not that army, the one from ""stripes!"""
26487,Homer,"no, he's gotta learn, marge. the way my dad made me learn."
31266,Homer,maybe i can sneak home without them seeing me.
19567,Homer,"thanks, marge."
29326,Homer,i'm here! i'm here! quit buggin' me!
27945,Homer,a lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
39463,Homer,"i'm sorry, marge, but sometimes i think we're the worst family in town."
20985,Homer,"yes, son. a spectacular failure."
35811,Homer,"now relax, dottie. leave everything to me."
36536,Homer,go where?
15643,Homer,i gave it to pepi.
19782,Homer,but what would turn bart into a man fast? you have to think for me!
40203,Homer,"ooooh, cushy."
13545,Homer,"so, did i pass?"
16455,Homer,"ooh, i would live in a big mansion?"
34627,Homer,aw dammit!
34711,Homer,they fight and bite? i never go to europe without learning something.
27200,Homer,"i came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'cause i already showered once today."
13721,Homer,"flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
15597,Homer,"you take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this..."
38583,Homer,"well, hello."
34129,Homer,how come grampa never shares those stories with us?
35478,Homer,"ned, i have a confession to make: i may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. but now, from the bottom of my heart, i wish you and edna the best."
39707,Homer,it's good! it's good! it's good!
32707,Homer,just gimme a minute. but feel free to go nuts on me.
19459,Homer,soul mate?
27609,Homer,one ribwich please.
23623,Homer,"you're a tough cookie, maggie, but i'm gonna win you over. just like i did with lisa."
14928,Homer,"because i don't care, okay? i can't fake an interest in this, and i'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
28561,Homer,maybe she was you and you're not! how many kids do we have?
32303,Homer,"ask no questions. and do not call the police, or i will kill me."
40591,Homer,we have meatloaf!
37173,Homer,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
40800,Homer,ow.
40768,Homer,you ignoramus.
32569,Homer,right.
35410,Homer,there's only one way out -- i'm committing barbicide!
18392,Homer,"yes, honey?"
26671,Homer,"as a reminder, marge."
17621,Homer,"huh? oh. yeah. thanks, lenny."
39900,Homer,cheese!
20553,Homer,"pfft. that's what they said about this billy beer, smartypants."
15621,Homer,so that's it!
31763,Homer,"yeah, but uh-- one of those i dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but i was too embarrassed to admit it, so i set the house on fire. it feels good to tell the truth. no, i'm lying again, it feels bad."
15055,Homer,"i sent in an application for you. i couldn't find a big enough photo, so i sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
26616,Homer,that is not a worm.
13581,Homer,you are? why?
37087,Homer,you never know when you might wanna mail something.
35049,Homer,huh?
23019,Homer,did you have fun with your robot buddy?
40015,Homer,"mmmm. marge, could you get me another beer, please?"
19135,Homer,right...
17401,Homer,"they're ruining my whole life. marge, please, this is where i need you the most. i'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. okay-- go."
32801,Homer,"wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a dad too lazy to run away!"
29736,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge -- i just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. they should get here soon. i paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
19442,Homer,hey buddy! get back there with the other rocks!
24295,Homer,"barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?"
15489,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
33517,Homer,"honey, don't cry. it could be worse -- at least it's not raining!"
39524,Homer,"the code of the school yard, marge! the rules that teach a boy to be a man. let's see... don't tattle... always make fun of those different from you... never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... hmmm, what else... ?"
41103,Homer,"yeah, right."
34350,Homer,"don't know, don't care."
36902,Homer,"oh, right."
30448,Homer,what was that for?
28616,Homer,"there are many people i'd like to thank for this award. my wife, anjelica huston -- this is for you, angie! we did it!"
26197,Homer,what?
22513,Homer,"and ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?"
31402,Homer,"rich maple color, good swirl..."
21414,Homer,could you open the window? the cops have daddy's prints on file.
23628,Homer,what are you pointing at? the ocean?
33910,Homer,do you want the golden globe?
38234,Homer,red card!
17756,Homer,all right!
13484,Homer,"oh, marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. y'know, i finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
36051,Homer,"oh, let's face it. i'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. and there's only one way out: i've gotta man up. okay, manning up... manning up. mannning-- girling down! girling down!"
24941,Homer,bad dog.
16988,Homer,"oh, i miss you too, marge. but the law needs me. i'll be home as soon as i can."
34537,Homer,"oh, that's just great. i discover electricity and they want to take it from me!"
22640,Homer,awful entertaining.
19231,Homer,"larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. and that... is a phony kidnapping."
13164,Homer,"hey, you're right. give it back! no, i still want you to have it. but every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
17972,Homer,hm. barney's movie has heart. but football in the groin had a football in the groin.
31520,Homer,has the boom been lowered?
37549,Homer,you think we'll last twenty-five years?
31330,Homer,i have to marge. who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
17663,Homer,listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show. it was a tumultuous time for our nation. the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
30024,Homer,"hey, gimme a break. living through lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me."
32552,Homer,how 'bout the deja viewmaster?
13521,Homer,"save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock."
20429,Homer,"quit runnin', son. i just want to give ya a big hug!"
21474,Homer,they didn't hear us in the sewing room.
41085,Homer,"no, we have to commit ourselves. now take this down. ""free to loving home. world's most brilliant dog. says 'i love you' on command."""
40290,Homer,"oh, knock it off, flanders! don't start blubbering on me. i'm gonna miss you too... not."
33232,Homer,"marge, i installed all the low energy bulbs!"
37419,Homer,is it that obvious?
32546,Homer,"what happened in this room? if only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. and i could use that money to-- hey, a memory!"
18514,Homer,i think she's trying to tell us something.
37346,Homer,i don't know. it's just that you always say we should try new things. but i thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
37941,Homer,homer in the movie wears ask body spray and so should you. don't ask! do smell!
19994,Homer,can i have this one?
32192,Homer,"but if i'd ever leave you, / it couldn't be in autumn. / how i'd leave in autumn i never will know..."
31902,Homer,"look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
31673,Homer,"why would i go to utah? i love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
16865,Homer,"""gomer upsets sergeant carter."" ooooh, i'll never forget that episode!"
35793,Homer,and kiss.
20241,Homer,lisa! enough saxomophone already!
27829,Homer,"""dear homer, i can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""
35858,Homer,"no, don't worry, i have my invisibility cloak. now where did i put it?"
24266,Homer,she knows what time dinner is.
34700,Homer,"ah, those guys are all crooks. they charge you for parts and labor? pick one, buddy! i can do this just fine by myself."
31847,Homer,she has not! your daughter's a dirty player!
25593,Homer,"i mean i knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez."
34581,Homer,"ooh, a baby whale. my diet is working."
19788,Homer,"hang onto it, toy-boy! you might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
37290,Homer,"keep it under your hat, guys, but i've got a date with a married woman."
27123,Homer,my official tour jacket!
34546,Homer,you used to be nicer!
19343,Homer,"i'd like to file, for divorce."
24424,Homer,...knock you out...
34710,Homer,can my son come too? he knows what to do when i swallow my tongue.
29923,Homer,sorry. give me one that doesn't taste so good.
22432,Homer,mr. power.
27739,Homer,wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... lisa's college fund?!
37158,Homer,"gotcha! candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see..."
30053,Homer,"kids, wanna go to the mall?! they're baking fresh cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
18650,Homer,"well, you can always depend on that."
24175,Homer,"like this, from the book of p-salms: ""god will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. that you may bathe your feet in blood."" as true today as it was when it was written."
28920,Homer,"gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of christmas."
37597,Homer,"hey, i'm the one in bed with two beautiful women."
19280,Homer,"uh, this isn't gonna be about jesus, is it?"
25255,Homer,"and if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all..."
31629,Homer,"but marge, i did it all for you!"
28445,Homer,"on our way to the clinic, i decided to give him a night his wang would never forget."
37540,Homer,"oh, uh, i'd better take this. y'see, moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
29141,Homer,do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
17887,Homer,what a wonderful dinner. what a beautiful family. someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
35505,Homer,"larry, my man!"
20698,Homer,"all right marge, you've convinced me, there are more terrible things / than musical comedies where everyone sings."
26041,Homer,son of a...
13902,Homer,"uh, sure... let me write you a check."
40401,Homer,woo-hoo-hoo!
36276,Homer,such a peaceful end.
21899,Homer,right on.
19402,Homer,see? you like everything.
28588,Homer,here we go. now it starts with the fees.
30968,Homer,"well, i'm just glad i'm not a god anymore. i wanna go home. how's chief wiggum?"
13337,Homer,it was me! you fell for it!
13458,Homer,"yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
18429,Homer,"wait, i know! ""vent gas."""
39545,Homer,rumpus room. great idea!
37059,Homer,he was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.
23527,Homer,"so, mindy? how did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
21254,Homer,"not if we hire more men. and my men will do all your messy jobs. they'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."
35506,Homer,"hey, you're not larry. how come you're not larry?"
24973,Homer,they have any father-and-son grifts?
30332,Homer,there's a little plastic man in your hair and i'm trying to rescue him.
39104,Homer,"but marge, i don't want you to ever stop caring about me."
37018,Homer,"out of our way, corn! the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
25448,Homer,hey kid and man!
20302,Homer,they're in my hair! they're in my hair!
19177,Homer,yes!
16490,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
21463,Homer,"no, no, honey. maybe this will help."
19375,Homer,"all clear, everyone."
29511,Homer,"dammit! i never win anything! ooh, here's something i'm good at."
35687,Homer,kids! guess what? mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
16685,Homer,"hey, what's that sound?"
27424,Homer,yeah. but what's gonna happen to the animals?
27389,Homer,"uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
35599,Homer,and i sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
32365,Homer,"hey, who wants ice cream in bed?"
17979,Homer,i've eaten eight different meats. i'm a true renaissance man.
16882,Homer,maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
16072,Homer,nerd!
18202,Homer,"todd smells. aw, i already knew that."
23558,Homer,lenny...
30507,Homer,her first words! play along. it's fifty cents less for babies!
24596,Homer,"what am i, a tailor?"
23742,Homer,i guess i'll never find her.
19064,Homer,we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
37293,Homer,date with my wife.
17502,Homer,i'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
26423,Homer,"listen to me, son. no one loves a quitter. so you go over there and you win her back."
39311,Homer,hmmmm. how could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
37258,Homer,"hey, i don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
21592,Homer,"well, i quit my job just like you said to."
37165,Homer,grownups have their reasons!
27917,Homer,me too -- i've come to hate my own creation. now i know how god feels.
37681,Homer,today i'm glad that i sold that stock.
25484,Homer,"okay, now. put..."
41105,Homer,"well, let 'em sleep on their own time!"
21571,Homer,"stupid movies. who invented these dumb things anyway? was it you, bart?"
33409,Homer,i wanna live in the sauce!
32613,Homer,we're free!
36700,Homer,i'm payin' for 'em.
21586,Homer,that's boring. you're boring everybody. quit boring everyone!
36225,Homer,why did i do that? / it sounds so dull and boring. / what was i thinking?
20854,Homer,it's patty.
15094,Homer,"marge, marge, look!"
19106,Homer,wow! my boss!
17312,Homer,eh. close enough.

15025,Homer,"no, don't tell me, i'll get it... oh, i know! the lord is vengeful! o spiteful one! show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
31195,Homer,but this is the only life i know!
32978,Homer,"hey, ned."
28405,Homer,"rub a dub dub, i'm washin' the blub."
38047,Homer,do you have my money?
20455,Homer,"oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
17752,Homer,there's that word again.
20956,Homer,"well, why would i want to look at a pen with a... oh no, her clothes are coming off! heh, heh. hey, you know who would love this? men."
30228,Homer,"marge, what are you doing here?"
28110,Homer,wait a minute. how could those stupid jar-heads win?
31174,Homer,great. but enough of the baseball analogies. they sicken me.
22593,Homer,that's no way to address sir drinks-a-lot.
25684,Homer,she's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? can they do that?
15521,Homer,maybe.
29973,Homer,"even better, i'll ask him for my job back."
32737,Homer,"stop saying things, bart! that's the tv's job!"
28465,Homer,"you hit him high, i'll hit him low!"
20923,Homer,i'm gonna be the best car thief ever.
23599,Homer,"i can't believe it, moe. the greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
25634,Homer,"well, i really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... although i do like the occasional beer..."
22801,Homer,a man in an apron!
22038,Homer,that's my girl.
26447,Homer,yes!
15309,Homer,"hello, i'm mr. plow. are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?"
14279,Homer,"starting tomorrow, i'm a nuclear technician!"
35177,Homer,"come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! i wanna take grampa to have his bellybutton pierced."
14370,Homer,you bet.
15297,Homer,no.
40258,Homer,"ohhh. well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe i'm all turned around on the subject. wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?"
24087,Homer,a man who's not afraid to cry.
30368,Homer,"praise the lord, i can walk again! what, my foot fell asleep."
14895,Homer,"ah, kids' letters from camp."
33966,Homer,"pay the man, boy."
20949,Homer,"oh-ho, i'll help you. help you die!"
30303,Homer,"well, that's very reasonable."
14260,Homer,you want fries with that?
25168,Homer,whuzzit... my juice box!

25830,Homer,"wake up, ya lousy drunk!"
30652,Homer,"look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky eucharist. i wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
16670,Homer,you can't sell that. karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
19204,Homer,"all right, i think we've heard just about enough from mr. newspaper today."
22232,Homer,what did you call me?

28740,Homer,wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
28613,Homer,"i don't think so, son. but on the other hand, i may be closer than you think."
38951,Homer,oops.

17388,Homer,precious venus...
35986,Homer,"less blathering, more slathering."
18381,Homer,"well, i use a computer!"
31205,Homer,i know -- i'll use that white-noise machine i got you when your father died.
24763,Homer,blue spanish eyes / teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes...
39272,Homer,"come on, son. let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- thirteen bucks? hey, wait a minute!"

28723,Homer,"you don't have to tell me, i was number three. listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?"
30852,Homer,"marge, toot-toot and her son escaped!"
37133,Homer,"you're saying it like it happens all the time. and by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. you call this a platinum club experience?"
23399,Homer,"ooh, there's ross perot, dr. laura, spike lee..."
40373,Homer,"but, marge, this is our big chance to show up the flanderses."
35703,Homer,hipsters... too cool for school...
31382,Homer,"seriously moe, i think you have a gift."
31539,Homer,"now remember, marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. but if i scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five."
27854,Homer,"stupid flanders with his misleading silhouette. well, i guess i have no choice but to go back home and... hey, i never noticed that newspaper box."
16715,Homer,"dad, i love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
40210,Homer,"well, he's got my vote."
21189,Homer,nuh-uh. it isn't filled until it's spilled.
28866,Homer,what the?
30665,Homer,"oh my god, i forgot to get marge a present!"
24333,Homer,the call is from heroism. will you accept the charges?
16770,Homer,"see because of me, now they have a warning."
15632,Homer,"oh, he is."
22431,Homer,you remembered my name!
33273,Homer,i'm in!
33423,Homer,god no!
31898,Homer,"yeah... something has changed, but i can't figure out what. our mattress! i traded it to the lovejoys!"
35237,Homer,"don't look back, marge. don't look back."
21006,Homer,i've joined the naval reserve.
27284,Homer,gotcha.
25371,Homer,here comes the jealousy bug. gonna git ya! gonna git ya!
33040,Homer,did he take the bait?
28223,Homer,"hey, the bathroom's a block away."
34993,Homer,don't ask questions! just go!
18398,Homer,"marge, this is everything i've ever dreamed of, right here."
20708,Homer,heart condition? get outta here.
24004,Homer,"hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
16083,Homer,"uh, excuse me ""professor brainiac,"" but i worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, i think i know how a proton accelerator works."
20626,Homer,...punk!
34942,Homer,huh? what'd i do?
32745,Homer,some of that is cow blood.
18733,Homer,"you su-diddily-uck, flanders! gimme that!"
31021,Homer,"well, i won't be lonely. i can always cuddle with the dog."
20219,Homer,"up up up up up up up. if ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"
13200,Homer,int. lakeside mansion - kitchen - present
30222,Homer,"look, marge, i know i was supposed to yell at that priest, but he's so cool. he plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
29183,Homer,wait a minute. are you trying to get dirt on lisa?
24757,Homer,"no, really."
36867,Homer,fine. keep 'em. but you have to give back... lisa?!
15637,Homer,"well, i'd better get you home."
14797,Homer,this sucks. where is that channel changer?
25287,Homer,"so barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and i'm like ""not even."""
13769,Homer,magic johnson! y'ello.
22096,Homer,wha?
39548,Homer,"come on, come on. let's go."
27292,Homer,"ooh, someone's coming!"
39328,Homer,nine hundred and twelve?
33572,Homer,"guys, what's it like?"
29100,Homer,kids love trains.
39053,Homer,i met a guy. a wonderful guy.
35382,Homer,and stay out!
41555,Homer,now why would i be angry and bitter? because i'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?
17727,Homer,of course!
38921,Homer,what?! when were you gonna tell me?
31962,Homer,"look at me, guys!"
30876,Homer,all expenses paid?
30318,Homer,woo hoo!
23602,Homer,"well, world, this is it. you know, i always thought you'd die before me. but now as i prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking..."
25022,Homer,"lies got us into this mess, son. from now on it's honesty all the way."
18490,Homer,don't forget me.
40163,Homer,marge and i played that old game before we were married.
18612,Homer,"marge, i'm bored."
13208,Homer,no problem.
29328,Homer,i swallowed a chicken bone.
29296,Homer,all right.
36157,Homer,"hey, it's called ""karma."""
34003,Homer,another politician who can't keep his promises.
22915,Homer,"yeah, but i should have no problem selling a thousand springs."
40189,Homer,"oh no, marge. come on, please."
33482,Homer,next problem.
33154,Homer,"marge, when i'm with you, i get that feeling like when i got that smart kid's report card by mistake. for a minute, i thought i had all a's. and that my name was howard simberg."
25207,Homer,"hmm. i don't know what that is, so i'm gonna say yes. now, go limp."
20470,Homer,"okay. half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, nelson, you just spin around in a circle."
27402,Homer,let me just put on my glasses.
38492,Homer,i can get another job! who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? i could be a prison warden or a southern anything.
18183,Homer,"c'mon, honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. if anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
30297,Homer,these are for you.
32260,Homer,okay. let me just grab my registration.
41411,Homer,why you little!
13420,Homer,"well, t.s."
35432,Homer,no.
39501,Homer,arrrgh!
33715,Homer,"oh, this is great, honey. thanks for telling me about it. i hope you don't mind i invited lenny."
19096,Homer,"ah, let's watch something else."
40060,Homer,gimme the usual.
21793,Homer,"please, homer. c'mon, if you let me hang around a while, i can do all kinds of stuff for ya."
29410,Homer,"wow, a wooden plane. it's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks."
30693,Homer,"wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
32998,Homer,"marge, i brought you some flowers! a full dozen this time! no tricks!"
27333,Homer,"oh, god!"
36059,Homer,private plane crashes.
31180,Homer,why can't you do anything?
22119,Homer,you... monster! how could you do that to the children?!
27183,Homer,"what's this? it's enormous! oh my god, there's another one!"
35366,Homer,"aw, can't we stay one more day? the occurrence and i are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
36435,Homer,i already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
28642,Homer,oh no! i hit the grief counselor!
34329,Homer,no line... near the men's room... i see no reason to question your choice.
37699,Homer,i'm homer simpson!
26722,Homer,"uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""angry dad: the motion picture""."
28109,Homer,it's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
40988,Homer,holy moly! the bastard's rich!
21190,Homer,"ooh, but i can rebuild!"
40896,Homer,"ugh, ah, hello, mr. burns. would you like to watch the fight?"
17947,Homer,it was a gummy bear.
25001,Homer,"so what's the pitch, old man?"
14264,Homer,"no, marge, i just can't. i mean, look at me. i'm a trainee... they won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. but i can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
39978,Homer,"bart, get the door!"
19082,Homer,you heard me -- they're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
17963,Homer,pull my finger.
38265,Homer,"once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
41405,Homer,those squeaks sound like couch springs. groovin' to the beat of love!
21320,Homer,"no, here. try my foot. no, not that foot. just feel my biceps."
27306,Homer,"america loves its kings, from george the third to larry."
15148,Homer,"run along, ya little scamp."
19705,Homer,"you mean ""meep meep""?"
19311,Homer,"marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
34504,Homer,"don't die on me, clancy. you said our friendship was special. well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of..."
17054,Homer,i told marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
40809,Homer,"hey, i paid for this car. i paid for this tuxedo and i paid for the two dinners. we're going to the prom."
26364,Homer,that's enough running.
16929,Homer,"oh, i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life. and, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
21949,Homer,"nooo, nothing made of dead guys. what's in the back?"
40415,Homer,underdog! don't you know anything?
23483,Homer,"well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope."
19128,Homer,"tired, eh? what you guys need... is hammocks."
41445,Homer,fourteen... fifteen... sixteen! woo-hoo!
17647,Homer,"hey, fellas. can i join?"
33975,Homer,"listen: of all the crazy things i've ever done, this is the craziest. and you're doing it."
23720,Homer,you're the hell's satans? what a fun coincidence. my gang's name is also the...
34225,Homer,"son, if i was interested in fun, i would've run away the day you were born."
32265,Homer,sometimes you want to work?
34853,Homer,"up, a father has his secrets."
21584,Homer,"... and he was a firm believer in fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was alva. and he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. and..."
34011,Homer,woo hoo! an unattended tap! like takin' beer from a baby!
27889,Homer,sorry i'm late -- the velvet mafia made me a margarita i couldn't refuse.
36117,Homer,"son, do you have a minute?"
29139,Homer,what'd you say?
23033,Homer,"ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, i'll get us the money. even if i have to get a second job."
30556,Homer,that's weird. he started off as an egg.
19798,Homer,"attaway, son! you made your old man proud!"
20210,Homer,you do that.
33245,Homer,i made us a little cake.
25317,Homer,badbye.
27989,Homer,help! help! i'm drowning!
40494,Homer,because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
18059,Homer,"what i'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
18229,Homer,run for your life!... ... boy!
25827,Homer,"good idea, mr. ed. wanna come along, noodle neck?"
39777,Homer,i gave you advice? get outta here.
14919,Homer,wha th... why are you talking like that?
39602,Homer,"but how can you afford something like this, ned? i get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than i do."
31691,Homer,"uh, this is eduardo, my pool boy. he thinks he's an angry rich man."
33335,Homer,what a racket.
25850,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna enjoy this."
36429,Homer,no one likes you!
32315,Homer,thanks to her!
27570,Homer,that's right! crawling on your knees!
29313,Homer,woo hoo! the circus!
14636,Homer,and dance by the light of the moonnnnnnnn!
33199,Homer,"hey, what's going on?"
29689,Homer,"don't mention it, miss october. but don't look at her passport, it's different."
37080,Homer,"ooh, thanks, dad."
40629,Homer,no way! because i'm not dying.
32515,Homer,no.
31283,Homer,where do you think you're going?
33209,Homer,i wanna change my bet... i'm going against my daughter.
30456,Homer,hmmm. i suppose i could use a little toning.
30249,Homer,"thanks, moe!"
23455,Homer,"all right, let's see what the old girl can do."
33916,Homer,"oh, that song's a little on the nose. can we do it to david bowie's ""heroes?"""
24962,Homer,i told you! i find them boring.
15886,Homer,marge! i passed!
35280,Homer,i guess it's just how i was raised.
14154,Homer,"oh, what am i gonna... hey, you! top being so unsafe! smitty -- safen-up!"
31292,Homer,"uh, no. just gas."
31025,Homer,"fine! i'll finish it myself. and don't think i'm gonna screw it up, because i won't!"
41092,Homer,"marge, what do we do?"
17880,Homer,rye am romer rimpson...
17815,Homer,"hey, what are these holes?"
29186,Homer,"well, she's into buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what i say..."
41472,Homer,shut up and go to the prom with me!
39481,Homer,"boxing, lisa, boxing. there's a world of difference."
35225,Homer,better shut up / cheech is really mad / i wish that i had gone with cho-ong...
39911,Homer,aw!
22506,Homer,"we sold it, didn't we?"
24693,Homer,there.
39794,Homer,"hey, what is this? the spanish exposition?"
32205,Homer,"oh, good. this makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance."
16735,Homer,shut up. and another thing - how come i can't get no tang 'round here? and also... hold on a second.
27575,Homer,"did you see that, boy? your mom thinks you're still here!"
33165,Homer,now we wait for the river to freeze. if my theory of global cooling is correct.
20788,Homer,"outta my way, jerk ass!"
17949,Homer,"but, i'm still hungry."
17472,Homer,"your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
36058,Homer,springfield talk!
26860,Homer,the missus prefers you call me simpson.
21825,Homer,so you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
30176,Homer,lookin' good... feel the burn...
38182,Homer,i guess i can't help but feel fully responsible.
13812,Homer,oh yeah? how much?
40529,Homer,i was watching that.
24777,Homer,mr. burns... i was wondering if i could get a raise.
31288,Homer,"must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping."
25495,Homer,those cats were fast as lightning...
20638,Homer,"what the-- where's christmas? lisa, where's christmas?"
35148,Homer,it would be an honor!
25578,Homer,don't worry. being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender.
37863,Homer,fine. i'll drink alone.
23582,Homer,"eww, thanks for sharing!"
21429,Homer,"hey marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? wee little parties?"
26746,Homer,stop it now.
25789,Homer,"well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. waive it..."
35048,Homer,a dinosaur!
21061,Homer,i am?
41454,Homer,"half-day, eh?"
41541,Homer,"here's what i say to that: no soup for you! because i am ""master of my domain."" newman."
26156,Homer,"quiet, lisa. everyone in the store is looking at you!"
26147,Homer,"dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good."
28273,Homer,i'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
17092,Homer,"ohmygodohmygodohmygod. all right, let's get our stories straight. she tripped, right?"
27535,Homer,"oh look, god's giving us a little shower."
13989,Homer,next.
21054,Homer,and you're like the father i never visit.
35570,Homer,"bart, i wanna ask you about something i read in a magazine. are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
29037,Homer,this is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
41144,Homer,"marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
17447,Homer,"oooh. ""mr. and mrs. erotic american."""
39805,Homer,"what are you on, pal?"
17216,Homer,"now, to absorb some local color through the magic of am radio."
38642,Homer,the eyes in that picture are following me.
34148,Homer,what? pulitzer prize application form?
23031,Homer,see? even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.
29198,Homer,"hey flanders, have you seen my frisbee?"
13580,Homer,"thanks a lot, michael. you really helped me get through this. if you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
26134,Homer,seems kinda pointless now.
41363,Homer,grampa?!
40564,Homer,"mr. burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
32356,Homer,"seconds, please."
19936,Homer,the bad dog or the good dog?
27621,Homer,that was awesome!
36559,Homer,we've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
18900,Homer,"oh, can i come?"
33341,Homer,is it some place i have to put on a tie?
31110,Homer,"sorry, flanders. but when you get in, you can use my audio tour. narrated by melanie griffith."
36476,Homer,and what he says is true because it's in all caps. are you gonna argue with caps?
24768,Homer,"get him, sheeba!"
26762,Homer,apu?
40088,Homer,"enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! enjoy! give me your plates. don't crowd. plenty for everybody."
38931,Homer,"oh! finally! the business call i've been waiting for! hello, this is--"
36077,Homer,yeah. non-jerks!
30387,Homer,i don't know. i kept away from maggie all day.
16325,Homer,i'm thirsty.
21752,Homer,"no, that would make me a great father."
30603,Homer,can i take my family?!
20772,Homer,"all right, better put on a pot of coffee, marge. this could take a while."
17728,Homer,bowling! bowling here! come bowl now! get yer bowling! who's ready?! bowling!
18480,Homer,hey!
15895,Homer,what's your problem?
37475,Homer,how do you know about carl's family?
31138,Homer,sure. that means she wants to talk in private. it's probably about you.
33677,Homer,hello maggie... hello maggie.
35158,Homer,hey! don't you know it's awards season? who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
22328,Homer,sorry.
14185,Homer,"yeah, but i have to hear about it."
26143,Homer,"okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
31487,Homer,"lisa, wake up! they're taking angelica to mount purgatorium."
34876,Homer,"ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!"
27338,Homer,who will take home the rampy?
32957,Homer,"son, coin collecting's a lot like life. it stopped being fun a long time ago. but unlike life, i have a solution for this."
26838,Homer,"uh, he's sleeping."
25720,Homer,"but ""dr. screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. well, you don't have to worry about the bill. we've never welshed on a... look, a bear!"
19449,Homer,"marge? marge? oh, now what? if you're still mad at me, i'm gonna be really mad."
16686,Homer,"hey, he's not happy at all. he lied to us through song. i hate when people do that."
41041,Homer,"thanks, boy. i was waiting for someone to say that."
13917,Homer,"that's for the courts to decide. marge, she loves me."
41467,Homer,"it was love at first sight, and you ruined it!"
31596,Homer,then what's america doing in iraq?
18604,Homer,marge! someone broke the toilet!
32703,Homer,"well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. and then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her."
40695,Homer,"oh, it was busy. moe, another last beer, please."
33355,Homer,angry nut coming through.
39209,Homer,marge!
15231,Homer,"ooh, me too."
28282,Homer,"oh, what a delicious quiche! i drive a pink miata."
26362,Homer,"wait, you really think marge is gonna fall for this guy? even after i bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
25548,Homer,mmmm... turbulent.
31242,Homer,"oh, uh, that was me. you know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""
16920,Homer,"elephant, honey. it's an elephant. and i'm sure he'll make a grand piano."
13240,Homer,see? you don't have to spend a lot of money to have a first-class wedding reception.
15810,Homer,i'm going to make it! i'm going to make it! this is the greatest thrill of my life! i'm king of the world! woo hoo! woo hoo!! i--
13612,Homer,"marge, you have a nice body. and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
26753,Homer,"okay, okay, don't go mary todd on us."
17797,Homer,that's the spirit. never give up.
37383,Homer,why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only god can do that...
22419,Homer,i'm begging you. i'm a human being. let me have my dignity back.
30061,Homer,marge... what if the rapture is coming and i haven't led a good enough life? i could be... left below!
31149,Homer,just sign your name above president lincoln's.
39708,Homer,it's good to see you all in church.
14626,Homer,but marge! it looks so easy! just like carving a turkey.
16166,Homer,i knew you'd come crawling back.
28747,Homer,"joke's on me, is it...?"
24743,Homer,"this is your fault, with your non-threatening bobby sherman-style good looks. no girl could resist your charms."
33163,Homer,"i know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, american history..."
37860,Homer,but christmas is a special time. and i like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.
25004,Homer,which one of you youngsters is abe simpson?
24880,Homer,what if i just whisper it?
36527,Homer,you do that.
27018,Homer,"uh, i really don't wanna do that, ned."
22843,Homer,"moe, this is astrid, my ""dealer."" and these are my fans, gunter, kyoto, and cecil hampstead-on-cecil-cecil."
14278,Homer,"no, you listen! this is my wife and this is my kid, and i'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
15779,Homer,nope. nope. nope.
16263,Homer,where you going?
18759,Homer,what do we win if the tongue is there?
16690,Homer,are we in india yet?
29086,Homer,"she was the prettiest girl i'd ever seen. uh... until i met your mother, who made that girl look like a godzilla made of garbage."
25381,Homer,"maggie, no!"
22501,Homer,"outlook. ""vista."" no. ""spotlight."" ""mosaic."" nah."
25430,Homer,what a crazy room. there's no albuquerque isotopes. it's the springfield... ohhhh.
23400,Homer,"okay, but there's... dan quayle and courtney love... tanya harding... al sharpton...?"
27492,Homer,"so that's all it takes, a little prayer."
34006,Homer,who's an unproductive worker now?
14620,Homer,all right. all right. we'll find a way. lousy manipulative dog.
22067,Homer,"i'm sorry, dad. the way i behaved was shameful. i guess fear made me run away. but love made me come back."
36184,Homer,what?
25560,Homer,that's okay. i got 'em.
14604,Homer,"look closer, lenny!"
30167,Homer,you're right. but you know who the real victim is here? ned.
33986,Homer,"marge, i tried my best to talk you out of this. but since you're going through with it, i beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt."
36216,Homer,all right.

22132,Homer,"all right, fine. i'll take a cab."
32941,Homer,now i'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
32269,Homer,"wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. just like god."
29625,Homer,"marge, i'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister patty."
15676,Homer,i'd sell my first-born son.
24010,Homer,"well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. we're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. all those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
40405,Homer,i got it right here in writing.
25067,Homer,marvelous! marvelous! enough! i grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
16430,Homer,barney. that is so insightful. how did you come up with that?
30073,Homer,"he writes ""3150518"" on the board."
27858,Homer,"what's the deal with this place? it's so manly, yet scented."
27071,Homer,you what?
22769,Homer,and you keep saying we need to do things together...
36667,Homer,"oh, it's hopeless! this room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. by which i mean every museum."
25844,Homer,"mm, unexplained bacon."
21000,Homer,"gentlemen, there's only one solution. we place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
23624,Homer,"hi, honey!"
36608,Homer,"eh, nothing we can do."
17155,Homer,deal!
19062,Homer,"oh my god, marge, it's escaped!"
32861,Homer,why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!
40819,Homer,shut up. i'm over as far as i can go!
24458,Homer,you're daddy's precious dancing queen!
27253,Homer,i can't remember the last time i cried like this.
39324,Homer,oh.
37451,Homer,i'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from garbage wings!
23636,Homer,"oh, you do love me!"
23826,Homer,"help us, virtual doc! look at me! i'm on my knees!"
18008,Homer,i ate seven pounds of fudge!
29762,Homer,that's a lot of places.
18303,Homer,lousy smarch weather.
24964,Homer,"stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."
36415,Homer,but i'm a married man.
16620,Homer,"well, i guess i'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
18875,Homer,"uh, you don't have to tell me, but i thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. i mean, i haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
33626,Homer,how'd you check?!
15963,Homer,the be sharps.
23067,Homer,let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
24443,Homer,who said that?
20413,Homer,flaaaan-ders...
19883,Homer,"ka-boom! blam! oh, excuse me again, dear."
18872,Homer,i have no idea who that is.
14600,Homer,i've never been so sure of anything in my life. i am going to win this lottery.
29215,Homer,you're not the boss of me.
26375,Homer,"just run the camera, you little..."
23286,Homer,whatever. i'll be at moe's.
22158,Homer,"eat my dust, dust!"
30591,Homer,"marge, i wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! game over, man! game over! so, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?"
35996,Homer,i still wanna see it.
18471,Homer,woo hoo! i'm so glad to have my mom back! i never realized how much i missed her.
30272,Homer,moe! what are you calling me for?
26355,Homer,uh huh.
38883,Homer,"that kid's got talent, but c'mon!"
14673,Homer,"ooh, a redneck bar."
39905,Homer,"honey, i'm home."
38312,Homer,"i'm sorry, that's all very nice. but i can't forget what you said."
29802,Homer,"well, i would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. i've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. okay, you've found your snitch."
25631,Homer,we need more ice! my thumb is fading fast.
21082,Homer,"well, i couldn't have done it without bart."
22449,Homer,nah. just park it.
34523,Homer,look at this electric bill! i'm not made of money! i'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
37546,Homer,"it's working. she's gone! all right, everyone, magically appear!"
19424,Homer,"uh, wiggy...? my chili's gettin' cold."
24655,Homer,guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
15381,Homer,you didn't build this house. you won
37210,Homer,"yeah. gay rights are human rights, baby."
22646,Homer,"it's true. i'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em."
36973,Homer,impending doom...
32050,Homer,"oh my god, this is amazing! wait, i'm gonna be driving. i'll go for the cup."
28397,Homer,"no, go ahead."
37928,Homer,all i ever had was you looking out for me. i've got nothin' now.
31544,Homer,i was talking to the cat!
40208,Homer,"where are we going, sir?"
15393,Homer,"hi, flanders."
28144,Homer,get out!
37750,Homer,"no, i didn't!"
23170,Homer,"oh, crap! here they come!"
26866,Homer,"oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. from our point of view. financially."
15224,Homer,are you kidding? i work like a japanese beaver.
39017,Homer,so do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?
20837,Homer,quiet. god looks like he has something important to say.
20898,Homer,so her career got in the way.
41087,Homer,"oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. hear what? oh, sure. c'mere, boy! put that prowler down. come here! come on boy! say it, boy! say ""i love you"" for the nice man! i lub you. good dog! good doggie! isn't that amazing? see you soon. woooo! wooo!"
26512,Homer,"gentlemen, i must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me."
13998,Homer,i'm homer simpson. i just took your test. i got a zero.
16709,Homer,"one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock. five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock!.."
24645,Homer,woo hoo! flood from water!
39888,Homer,"look, adil. you can call me dad."
15603,Homer,pigabar? what the hell is pigabar?
41356,Homer,"calm down, homer. calm down."
25975,Homer,"man, when's the last time moe cleaned this?"
27810,Homer,what? are you sure?
23642,Homer,"looks like daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
20815,Homer,and it didn't cost us a dime.
40216,Homer,"ah... great toast, marge. hmmm. oh, by the way, the night before the election mr. burns is coming over for dinner."
28711,Homer,"to old man burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
32178,Homer,"dude! you don't think you know me, but you do!"
18797,Homer,"i'm really sorry i hit you, mr. burns. here, let me put some salt on that eye."
19729,Homer,"okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
30109,Homer,three... two... one...
23237,Homer,"hey, i had lenny's name on that!"
40346,Homer,wait! wait! there's more...
20850,Homer,"what am i gonna call my internet company? all the good names are taken. oh, wait, i've got it! flancrest enterprises."
26307,Homer,my mouth. my beautiful mouth.
29716,Homer,something's wrong with bart. he's acting weird.
21210,Homer,apologize for that remark.
24065,Homer,you want anything else? water? chili fries? how about some white noise?
36950,Homer,"what the--? ooh, it's hopeless."
19978,Homer,"hokkaido, eh?"
27581,Homer,do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
25996,Homer,"it's not fair. just when i was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away."
26069,Homer,"but mr. burns, you're exhausted."
22127,Homer,"relax, you're in good hands. now come on, i'll pull you up."
31220,Homer,no mas! no mas!
17057,Homer,oh yeah. she's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
38021,Homer,pale ales. please.
15289,Homer,wow! just think what i could do with that plow.
36803,Homer,hope is all around me!
22478,Homer,chesty larue.
18097,Homer,"that's okay. i'm supposed to be workin', too."
14101,Homer,"moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe..."
31883,Homer,"marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago."
28756,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you're getting into that school!"
25269,Homer,wow. how do you come up with such witty remarks?
27613,Homer,that sounds like a magical family moment. i'm sorry i won't be there.
27340,Homer,michael jackson just told me to shut up!
24278,Homer,"ah, trash night. in france, they call it ""la nuit des poubelles."" in germany, it's ""crappenfest."""
20495,Homer,it's you.
30879,Homer,"so, what's the prize on this wife swap show?"
23796,Homer,perfect.
31863,Homer,but to get that dvd i had to become a pbs subscriber! now i'm paying for crap like american masters!
31072,Homer,"no, it was the happiest night of my life! the warm spring air, the swings i took in the batting cage afterwards... don't you remember, darling?"
38914,Homer,for the first time i actually had to do my job.
33485,Homer,"he what?! flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! you lounge around in your egg macmansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!"
18718,Homer,"they have beer and gum, right?"
20805,Homer,"na na na na na na na na leader / na na na na na na na na leader / lea-der, lea-der, lea-der!"
14376,Homer,you got it.
27080,Homer,i am so excited i couldn't fall asleep! i even took some pills i found on the floor and still nothing!
39414,Homer,umm... what the hey. i'll take the job.
15698,Homer,"roll in at nine, punch out at five. that's the plan."
29247,Homer,"man, that hurt. and now to do the exact same thing again."
38421,Homer,woo-hoo!
16591,Homer,"lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
41285,Homer,i'm not thinking. you think.
31050,Homer,"yeah, but he's cool with it. right?"
29976,Homer,fifty dollars? what about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
18517,Homer,"quick, down to the fallout shelter! the bombs are dropping!"
20749,Homer,"cooder, spud. get off that hog. you're coming to stay at our house."
34701,Homer,"don't worry, i got it!"
20904,Homer,"hey, don't give up, moe. the girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
26952,Homer,"what, and let them come after you and the kids?"
21092,Homer,"no, because... you see i went ahead and... year-wise, i was counting forward from the last previous..."
15032,Homer,"ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
15498,Homer,"barney, i'm not getting a sex change!"
16468,Homer,oh no! i'm sweating like roger ebert.
15742,Homer,don't think about beer... don't think about beer... don't think about beer...
39964,Homer,"i love you, marjorie."
31464,Homer,marge?
23915,Homer,now i'm ready to hit the town.
23457,Homer,and... there.
38022,Homer,not marmaduke! never marmaduke!
35980,Homer,"you try it, maggie!"
27489,Homer,the grass is actually greener on flanders' side.
23572,Homer,you've got a father. he's just a dud.
38719,Homer,just like i planned.
32122,Homer,"as i said, i've lost all hope."
26016,Homer,it's not about spite. it's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor moe. now help me nail up this urinal.
36628,Homer,"i'll tell you what i want, marge. i want to make another simpson. the table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. and anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect."
23431,Homer,"he's out there, isn't he?"
33705,Homer,"look, man, i don't want any trouble. c'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. leave me alone, okay?"
16321,Homer,there we go.
35584,Homer,"squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. a real spider would get so mad if i did this! i wonder if this thing has batteries."
27090,Homer,sorry mick!
37823,Homer,why you little--
17314,Homer,"i can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. sunrise, sunset / sunrise, sunset / cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon / yes, we have no bananas!"
30712,Homer,"now, why don't you stay for dinner."
17023,Homer,"i mean, woo hoo!"
41205,Homer,"been a little slow these past few months. not much to steal in the desert, you know."
26973,Homer,"eh, he had a good run."
40968,Homer,fine. thank you.
35737,Homer,"okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
21188,Homer,crap -- py -- stuff.
41439,Homer,bart! can the chatter and fetch me a baloney sandwich!
36762,Homer,i submit! i submit!
35775,Homer,"uh-oh, a meeting with the mayor. how do i prepare for that?"
25121,Homer,"hmmm. increase my killing power, eh? let's do it."
16240,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. it was worth it."
37816,Homer,"ooh, spaghetti."
23559,Homer,practice ball! practice ball!
15768,Homer,"well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, mr. burns or me."
14981,Homer,"marge, come to bed."
33371,Homer,what will this box reveal? and what will i use this box for afterwards? mismatched nuts and bolts? recipes? i may never know.
39542,Homer,"where the hell are my keys? who stole my keys? come on, i'm late for work."
35485,Homer,"i've got some bad news for you, marge. i'm actually not."
18007,Homer,"lisa, lisa! where were you!? you missed the most incredible thing!"
20456,Homer,"i didn't raise him to be a quitter, marge. it must have been you. you've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
39304,Homer,"i didn't get my christmas bonus. i tried not to let it ruin christmas for everybody, but no matter what i did, i just couldn't --"
24493,Homer,but we never saw people like us on tv.
31576,Homer,shiiiii... pwreck!
15567,Homer,please.
41062,Homer,here's your magazines. how many of these guys are named corey?
37446,Homer,"you did it, baby. you promised no fun and you delivered."
14783,Homer,"yes, but doesn't the bible also say, ""thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
34177,Homer,and you like potato...
19493,Homer,really? you were? but how did you find me?
37264,Homer,"because if i hit you back, we'll be even. but if i don't hit you, that makes me the better man. and i'm liking the way that feels."
35969,Homer,leave her alone! that's my only talking daughter!
14505,Homer,people are talking... lots of people.
24994,Homer,"hello, is the lady of the house in?"
29393,Homer,"sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. if i turn this dial..."
23406,Homer,not fast enough!
13480,Homer,"forget it, marge!"
17171,Homer,gotta go.
18512,Homer,do i smell cookies? where's the cookies?
31161,Homer,oh yeah...
32876,Homer,it didn't have to go down like this!
27267,Homer,"so, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
39629,Homer,pfft. maps.
20530,Homer,"nah, just your screwy country."
29212,Homer,everything's comin' up homer.
20254,Homer,oh my god. everyone's gone! little bart...
15061,Homer,"no, she won't. when it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, more! more! and if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
16576,Homer,sorry.
24922,Homer,but why?
40225,Homer,"but you do get to express yourself. in the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
30842,Homer,"oh, you haven't seen bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume i let something terrible happen."
31257,Homer,"...i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, infinity. i never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
15320,Homer,cutting my nails? brushing my teeth?
27764,Homer,i need a vacation.
38428,Homer,lots of pizza.
34671,Homer,mexico! andalé! andalé! arriba!
18982,Homer,"you're not going to school today. today, your classroom will be the capitol city amphitheater. your teacher? four dozen rock bands. so get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. woo hoo!"
15627,Homer,ugly... wiener... crater face... soo-ee! soo-ee!...
26922,Homer,aw...
17040,Homer,"incorrect, marge. two perfectly good jackets."
38868,Homer,can i turn my phone on?
25949,Homer,"the bridge column. oh, that south. you never know what he'll do next. hm... aw. look at that dad in ""drabble."" he's like an unfunny version of me."
14451,Homer,hello maggie.
18629,Homer,i think this is the best neighborhood in town. anybody agree with me?
36729,Homer,i never thought homer simpson would be a part of the day of the locust.
30163,Homer,"okay. flanders, you see..."
32133,Homer,"one small coffee, please. and a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it."
27486,Homer,"well, i guess flanders doesn't have all the luck."
19147,Homer,aargh!
15312,Homer,"absolutely! my prices are so low, you'll think i've suffered brain damage."
27076,Homer,omigod! omigod! omigod! it's mick jagger and keith richards...
37065,Homer,"now i know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes."
25225,Homer,tom savini?
30329,Homer,"okay, just let me clear some space."
23688,Homer,stupid mongoose! get the snake! the snake! do i look like a snake? ow! ow! he bit me show's over! show's over! next show is eight o'clock and ten!
18611,Homer,saturday afternoon tv is so boring.
24291,Homer,"you wish. that's the stage we call ""professor barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. here's drunk."
34907,Homer,"all right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
16529,Homer,"lisa, your mom still loves you. it's just that she has a career, now. she's a slot jockey."
13216,Homer,"long have we awaited the coming of the white man, and carl."
39742,Homer,"ummm, nah..."
32017,Homer,here! it's yours!
36864,Homer,what? no one judges my wife's thunderbags! well maybe i was wrong about these people. who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
23038,Homer,"well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
20415,Homer,"i know, sweetie, and i got him right in the... uh-oh."
36662,Homer,"okay, remember the plan. apologize to grampa. then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot."
15547,Homer,i did it!
28808,Homer,no way! he's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
23453,Homer,absolutely. this is our big chance. the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
37150,Homer,and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year.
13832,Homer,"he gets it from your side of the family, you know. no monsters on my side."
37932,Homer,"but when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what i believe in."
28316,Homer,touch that mini bar and you're dead!
40310,Homer,"i was graceful. i was witty. brother, i was somethin'."
20163,Homer,"can i see your copy of ""swank"", armin?"
20841,Homer,you liar. you don't have a home business. why would you make up a lie like that?
27862,Homer,"you are? hm, which will win out? my old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that i've already mixed my laundry with yours. i'll have to sleep on it."
16611,Homer,"oh, this doesn't work any more."
19049,Homer,all right.
37468,Homer,it's too small to read.
29318,Homer,"marge! i figured out a way we can get in on this quimby lawsuit! bart, go ahead."
32024,Homer,what'd you say?
16869,Homer,"shove it, buddy."
24384,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
37340,Homer,the minister's wife? what are you here for?
35347,Homer,lousy saint louis cardinals. can't win the nineteen eighty-five world series on classic sports.
32686,Homer,"hey boy, check out my new car!"
37771,Homer,"oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
18966,Homer,"hi there! been a while since i set foot in good vibrations music. where can i find the latest releases by ""bread?"""
41424,Homer,it was that golden weekend between summer school and regular school...
26000,Homer,"wow, it looks like an alien headquarters. couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? couldn't ya? hey, wait up."
24560,Homer,oh no!
23261,Homer,i'd sure hate to be him.
32054,Homer,that's me!
25585,Homer,it's a flower.
39018,Homer,"""ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" it's as old as the bible."
35097,Homer,um... i'll see myself out.
25166,Homer,"huh? oh, you want a hug. well that, i know how to do."
36193,Homer,um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
30597,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
41097,Homer,"no, bart. no!"
16969,Homer,"look! ree, ree. ree, ree. aye, aye. all right, all right, i won't take the dog. c'mere."

26218,Homer,"ah, the sweet couple of seconds before i remember why i'm sleeping on the lawn."
24883,Homer,"and who's selling the uranium to the terrorists? montgomery burns. now, we wait."
33033,Homer,phew. now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
37991,Homer,"glasses, take me two minutes back in time."
34364,Homer,meters?
26400,Homer,"hey marge, watch me burn flanders. ned flanders bids fifty dollars."
25692,Homer,stupid grill!

26418,Homer,"all right, son. we'll all go -- first class!"
33518,Homer,"see, i told you, it's not raining. so we're just homeless."
17929,Homer,yes. i am in flavor country.
26459,Homer,aren't you forgettin' someone?
25293,Homer,"well, i'm ready for the big tournament."
40306,Homer,"well, i get up, i dance, i spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of baby elephant walk."
35975,Homer,"no, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
34456,Homer,there's always a catch.
39363,Homer,you can't stay in there forever!
30119,Homer,"wait! before you go, there's one thing i gotta know. what happened to my family?"
30806,Homer,"hey moe! thanks to you, i've been sober a week!"
37810,Homer,oh.
39663,Homer,shhhh! just watch.
25638,Homer,"oh, why isn't this working?"
15438,Homer,fall on your knees / oh hear the angels' voices /
29882,Homer,"you're right, marge -- i guess i should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats."
24183,Homer,"now, if ""the flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
21097,Homer,"okay, marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, lisa's a clergyman, maggie is seven people and bart was wounded in vietnam..."
36796,Homer,"huh. ""hope."" is this one of those coincidences like jesus on a tortilla or george washington on a dollar bill?"
20940,Homer,"moe, you gotta get me outta here. tell the cops i didn't steal the car. say you lent it to me."
30886,Homer,"yeah, well i have full tenure."
39066,Homer,dammit!
15304,Homer,almost time for our commercial.
24067,Homer,"what the... oh, you want a rock fight, eh?"
23908,Homer,"what's that, sonny?"
22554,Homer,"aw, crap! it's a girl's car. i can't drive this."
37539,Homer,because it's in the public domain?
17222,Homer,"all right, we're here. let us never speak of the shortcut again."
18921,Homer,"well, anyway, i'm still outraged."
23326,Homer,a bat! now that's a new one.
18540,Homer,"bart, you're coming home."
33052,Homer,"stupid shopping list, turning food into work. bart!"
24529,Homer,"so, uh, how's everybody doing?"
25346,Homer,"you know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff."
40102,Homer,"bart, what are you doing?"
38203,Homer,i'll pay you in strupo...
35054,Homer,but you do like comic books.
33902,Homer,great! do you want to see me naked?
40084,Homer,"i love you, karl -- marge."
30957,Homer,"well, a little book once told me..."
35338,Homer,and we've got front row seats!
33557,Homer,"come on, lady, have a heart. i screwed up! i'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!"
26930,Homer,you'll do as i say or i'll have your badges. once i make and give you your badges.
20874,Homer,"yes! yes! oh, god yes!"
23245,Homer,"we should have paid more attention to these side-effects. it's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
19955,Homer,"good one, mom! / you're so bad, honey."
28787,Homer,"ooh, well, i am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. and the wager only sweetens the deal."
13199,Homer,"si, los cales."
23570,Homer,any questions?
29383,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"
29955,Homer,cbs.
13656,Homer,uh... sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
33978,Homer,"we've gotta get marge some professional training. carl, do you know heavyweight champ drederick tatum?"
40844,Homer,"oooo. pro wrestling from mexico. you know, down there it's a real sport."
25783,Homer,"well, i learned my lesson. from now on you two are the only kids i'll care about. oh, and maggie."
30421,Homer,i guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
34601,Homer,my little einstein.
31862,Homer,"sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
27412,Homer,"cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. ooh, a trash can. we'll find breakfast in here."
16045,Homer,the bee bit my bottom. now my bottom's big! oh!
23699,Homer,promise you won't laugh?
38655,Homer,you're the only guy i know with less hair than me.
28334,Homer,"lady, please. get back in your overturned car. let the guys handle this."
20165,Homer,"all right, all right. so, he's a fraud. i don't care! his mom doesn't care! do any of you care?"
38632,Homer,"marge likes sushi, i like gum that squirts in your mouth. she's into romantic comedies, i like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. yep, marge and i see the world in totally different ways."
35809,Homer,oh no you don't.
41211,Homer,oh my god! a naked celebrity. be cool. don't stare at his famous wang.
18160,Homer,"i swear, i've never seen that gun before."
35845,Homer,"are we done yet? ""it's a wonderful life"" is about to start. i wonder what my life would've been like if i'd never seen that movie..."
39232,Homer,"marge, well, let me be honest with you."
17976,Homer,"marge, look. this has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's beer nuts. mmm... beer nuts."
33778,Homer,"i see. well, maybe you're not ready for this book. it is more of a big girl thing."
20154,Homer,"or ""crapweeds""."
37337,Homer,"moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
31132,Homer,really? you'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
33130,Homer,do you have a pineapple pizza?!
35517,Homer,"i love you so much! potatoes and gravy on the side, please."
21101,Homer,woo hoo!
38780,Homer,"i'm sorry, apu. i thought you were living your dream life, so naturally i wanted to ruin it. but now i know things stink, so i'm okay with it."
27816,Homer,it's how the pros do it.
21796,Homer,i can't read.
28090,Homer,i never knew you were such a beatles fan.
25264,Homer,"keep walkin', flanders."
23754,Homer,"oh, thank god."
17780,Homer,"well, i got everything i was supposed to get. i'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. that advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
17552,Homer,"you see?! you see?! ""i"" just left ""my"" first session and ""i"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
19277,Homer,working... so... late... that...
32409,Homer,"good idea. i'll drown my sorrows in anchor steam beer! oh, i'm sorry!"
17991,Homer,"i said, pull my finger."
14138,Homer,did you buy this car with your stock money?
26285,Homer,remember what i told you about running away from your troubles?
34276,Homer,how can i ever thank you?
14239,Homer,well... it takes me a long time to learn anything... i'm kind of a goof-off...
21117,Homer,"uhhhh, like those. but involving you."
17941,Homer,my ears are burning.
23884,Homer,"okay, who needs another lamb rack?"
15068,Homer,hmmm.
13253,Homer,"no, she's mine!"
31311,Homer,"yeah, get him a woman. that'll end his misery!"
27029,Homer,wait'll moe sees how wasted i got without him. he's gonna plotz.
39441,Homer,bart! lisa! maggie!
38122,Homer,no. no. i can't be old yet. i won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till i'm fifty-two!
15531,Homer,"""what if?"" what if i'm taking a shower and i slip on a bar of soap? oh, my god, i'd be killed!"
25435,Homer,i was? but i love the swing.
37755,Homer,"yeah, that guy didn't even look over once."
18455,Homer,here lies... walt whitman?!!
25165,Homer,i'unno. must be sumpin' i wrote before moe fixed me.
33187,Homer,you'll always have a special place in his heart!

34447,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
16819,Homer,can't talk... see flanders... later sex.
13986,Homer,okay. hank.
27839,Homer,"no, the voters will decide that in november. i was talking about this."
36690,Homer,"oh my god. i never knew the sacrifices my father made. move over, fonzie. i've got a new hero."
28560,Homer,then why did you appear in it?
40093,Homer,yea... eh... how about a pony?
22842,Homer,"good work, honey. keep it comin'."
25271,Homer,i've had it with that school!
29597,Homer,"yeah, be cool. like us."
30822,Homer,protect the duck! protect the duck! produck the tect!
40986,Homer,hello in there.
35563,Homer,they always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
29034,Homer,comic book guy! don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
16132,Homer,lobo! lobo! bring back sheriff lobo! lobo! lobo!
20711,Homer,"yes, sir!"
27657,Homer,tissues please!
39492,Homer,bart!
13700,Homer,twenty dollars?
36313,Homer,no.
37818,Homer,"may i ask what this is regarding? oooh, a budding new friendship? oooh! boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
38973,Homer,wanna see me make a muscle?
24726,Homer,ow! that bullet went in.
23515,Homer,they'll be back. we control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
39792,Homer,"no, no, marge. it's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
21394,Homer,this is no good. i've got to get up higher.
38138,Homer,sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. or...
33292,Homer,what?!
23355,Homer,"when i think about ned, i can't help but remember the look on his face when marge drove over..."
32549,Homer,i'm afraid i did something to make marge and the kids leave me.
33667,Homer,he is pretty good with her.
26539,Homer,"boy, did you make a prank call to brazil?"
33056,Homer,you just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
18467,Homer,you remembered.
18790,Homer,"i'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir."
37520,Homer,but somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
24044,Homer,"better do what he says, marge."
24562,Homer,who's up for a merry jig?
16974,Homer,"how do you do, sir?"
32908,Homer,a donut from the future!
16300,Homer,"solid waste, i could kiss you."
13922,Homer,"well you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
38922,Homer,when?!
17206,Homer,"hey, look marge! they're still not fightin' back! i can be a jerk and no one can stop me! hee hee hee hee!"
40507,Homer,wowww....
25011,Homer,so we're under arrest for fraud?
26626,Homer,smoke on the water / doo doo doo doo / doo doo doo doo / doo doo doo / doo doo
15419,Homer,"no, sweetie. ""daddy."""
34439,Homer,"well, if i made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in."
27557,Homer,see you in court.
14165,Homer,"oh, oh, oh. i'm sorry. we were talking about chocolate?"
22421,Homer,then i'd like to legally change my name.
38559,Homer,mmm. sandwich.
23725,Homer,"caps and frisbees, sir."
38933,Homer,"eh, they'll grow back."
16108,Homer,"guys, believe me, i didn't mean to get you expelled..."
33012,Homer,there's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
23021,Homer,wow. i can't believe someone i never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
38266,Homer,hey! look at me! i'm going up a slide!
13434,Homer,are you?
28422,Homer,"oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!"
29169,Homer,"bart, you're grounded for a year."
35241,Homer,tell him how you feel.
35892,Homer,and don't wake me up to land!
22946,Homer,i do.
14712,Homer,"marge, look at me."
37110,Homer,"sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?"
27712,Homer,yes!
33254,Homer,dynamite?! they are terrorists! must leave quietly.
15156,Homer,i'unno.
16164,Homer,"sorry, burns. no deal."
37365,Homer,touché.
29557,Homer,but there was one righteous man: noah!
24764,Homer,i think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
16386,Homer,please not flanders. please not flanders. please not flanders.
36871,Homer,"even flanders agrees! this is our neighborhood. we were here first, so you should leave."
13869,Homer,"okay, okay. but i want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. well i don't have one."
40839,Homer,that's right. sixty-eight channels. mtv for the kids. vh-1 for us. sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!
40872,Homer,"there is something wrong with that kid. she's so moral. why can't she be more like... well, not like bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
33412,Homer,are you kidding? we couldn't even convince you that bruce wayne is batman.
38611,Homer,useless left-handed crap.
23713,Homer,"you can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the cobras."
31467,Homer,the world's not that interested!
30123,Homer,"buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
39765,Homer,"ooh. clean up. now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in."
34441,Homer,how 'bout a greg norman executive putter from the sky mall?
34574,Homer,nature is a toothless dying hag! we are gonna save those whale babies!
25832,Homer,yep. everything worked out for the best.
29277,Homer,blood for creme! blood for creme!
34823,Homer,i'll take... that one.
18405,Homer,"y... y... y... let's see, so many letters to choose from. i'll pick y."
23573,Homer,next question.
33253,Homer,i am sorry i suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. i hope we can move past this and...
28581,Homer,a ten-speed bike?! what did your mother say?
28323,Homer,what? what play?
19042,Homer,hello.
39693,Homer,no!
39811,Homer,your photo?
39738,Homer,"huh... a very thoughtful gift. but it's a surprise. you know, it's such a beautiful morning, i think i'll take a little stroll around the block."
25803,Homer,i'll meet you in wilmington.
25766,Homer,"yes, through the magic of caring."
25458,Homer,what's going on? what am i doin' here?
29641,Homer,"patty, i admire your decision. it takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. so i'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
25854,Homer,"won't you marry me, bi-ill? / i got the wedding gown bi-ill / 'cause weddings are ni-ice..."
16875,Homer,"heh, heh. stick it to the man. no, wait!"
17665,Homer,i was at my work station when suddenly...
28817,Homer,investor confidence? perhaps this affects me -- i own two hundred and thirty million shares of ziffcorp stock.
26863,Homer,o-kay.
37372,Homer,"oh, now we're talkin'. but why me?"
37855,Homer,i don't have to pick up the dog poops!
32252,Homer,does it work?
38603,Homer,lisa! motorcade!
13968,Homer,"okay, okay, calm down."
37246,Homer,but the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
33615,Homer,suckers!
34467,Homer,"well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation."
16891,Homer,"hey, what's with them?"
35636,Homer,can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
13532,Homer,you don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
20799,Homer,wait - i'm confused about the movie. so the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
36546,Homer,maybe.
29642,Homer,"oh, i just love it here. so many things, and so many things of each thing!"
40360,Homer,"come on, boy."
18214,Homer,"oh, there's my sweet little maggie."
38817,Homer,i guess i'll take the concentration camp one.
26472,Homer,you? no way. it's too dangerous.
35211,Homer,i'll give dave your message.
28052,Homer,"the guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""fargo""?"
14649,Homer,let me pet him again!
34733,Homer,"yeah, the luck lasts longer! thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!"
13752,Homer,huh? noise. bad noise!
23254,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. daddy's got it covered."
32638,Homer,"you too, fred thompson."
14944,Homer,i'm all naked and wet!
22474,Homer,"so, trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
33530,Homer,wolves are taking all our women.
41479,Homer,i've traveled through space and time to make marge settle for me because she doesn't know better.
27971,Homer,"all my life, kent. i prefer ""catsup"" to ""ketchup."" and to me, ""yusuf islam"" will always be ""cat stevens."""
22254,Homer,"all right, let's get our stories straight for marge and maude. we were out buying them fabulous gifts..."
26103,Homer,"how about benihana, where dinner is the show?"
32834,Homer,"just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human."
27502,Homer,vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god. i could do this all day. and i just might. vengeful god / loving god. vengeful god / loving god.
27449,Homer,"look, i'm the first to admit it. i don't write good parts for women."
21948,Homer,"cherry garcia... honey bono... desmond tutti fruitti... lisa, help daddy find some normal flavors."
15366,Homer,"heh, heh. got your nose."
13609,Homer,"oh, you're right."
39884,Homer,"did you see that? you know, marge, this is the way i've always wanted it to be. we've become a fully functioning family unit. we've always blamed ourselves, but i guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
24821,Homer,"i don't need to rehearse. ho, ho, ho, merry... line!"
31276,Homer,thank you honey!
19587,Homer,"hey, fat tony! you still with the mafia?"
21545,Homer,"oh, yeah."
36998,Homer,"marge, this is it! teotwawki!"
40957,Homer,twen... forty-eight. this is it.
21746,Homer,"well, we can't compete with that, but--"
36766,Homer,"sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache."
28573,Homer,"for more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. we're not affiliated. we're just piggybacking on their message board."
40336,Homer,"get this. he said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!"
21804,Homer,"nothing, nothing. i'm just broadening my horizons. uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a humvee?"
30903,Homer,"so it would appear. however, cousin it, there, was born a woman."
25017,Homer,"chief, i'd like to scare my son straight. could i show him a jail cell?"
25955,Homer,"so, i guess you wouldn't mind if i was to dig a hole of my own."
20399,Homer,now wait a second. you doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
38398,Homer,"ooh, doubles!"
34641,Homer,i'm doomed.
16621,Homer,lemme through! i gotta find a big t. there's millions of dollars buried under a big t!
19080,Homer,these candidates make me want to vomit in terror! i've got to stop them!
15075,Homer,time i wreck your life?
34807,Homer,have you seen these kids?
32462,Homer,do you like guys who are... attractive?
30479,Homer,i can relate. i've fought that foe and lost many times.
39454,Homer,"bart, please. five bucks for a kiss."
37445,Homer,"you like this now? what about ""planet jackson and the earth brigade?"""
39302,Homer,but he's a loser. he's pathetic. he's...
37663,Homer,get down / everybody's gonna leave their seat
33443,Homer,fine. back. and we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
23305,Homer,okay.
31189,Homer,"okay. take it, take it! just don't hurt me!"
24855,Homer,"ooh, a dancing jesus. de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. if there's a better use for the internet, i haven't found it."
16066,Homer,something i should have done a long time ago...
28967,Homer,"son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""
30945,Homer,"oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk..."
39188,Homer,do you know where she is?
29938,Homer,"not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
15688,Homer,"your conscience? lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
35622,Homer,i thought of it first.
27968,Homer,"but as for you, santa's little helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!"
14112,Homer,"ooh, that's a lot of money."
27619,Homer,"maybe i should hook up with you guys. after all, how long do any of us have to live?"
36218,Homer,"it's just dream hail! ow! oh! ow! dream hail! hey, there's a dream truck!"
19118,Homer,doh!
37562,Homer,a whole weekend away from my family. i can't believe i have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. send me a picture?
24448,Homer,much better.
26975,Homer,hm...
34556,Homer,"ooh, it's dinner time!"
15495,Homer,"oh well, i could use a good laugh."
29159,Homer,"well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in america."
19774,Homer,"bart, i want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
16675,Homer,outrageous.
26042,Homer,"i'm sorry i shot you, moe."
16907,Homer,"i only have two questions. how much, and give it to me."
15580,Homer,"marge, i'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
29702,Homer,"ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture."
35743,Homer,woo-hoo!
28115,Homer,or did it?
27231,Homer,"oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, lisa."
16462,Homer,like what?
13780,Homer,"oooh, right next to the boss. eh, he'll never know who did it."
30936,Homer,a book?
31977,Homer,"fine, you want out? then go! i can make it on my own! before i met you i had friends and dreams!"
41112,Homer,i miss my daddy.
27215,Homer,perfect.
24290,Homer,i threw you a party at my house.
35712,Homer,ex-tinct!
35021,Homer,can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
33059,Homer,bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
19629,Homer,i think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
27446,Homer,"don't worry, i'll set fire to the hive."
21691,Homer,i see a horn!
23495,Homer,this better be good.
23112,Homer,ohhh.
40476,Homer,"you didn't mean that. bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises i don't expect you to keep. if you make this promise, you have to keep it."
14934,Homer,"kids, wait in the car. i want to talk to your mother about this play thing."
38860,Homer,that's good.
31358,Homer,i'm not gonna surrender. you've seen what the u.s. army does to prisoners. how would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
33862,Homer,i drove.
39685,Homer,"ooh, those stupid eggheads."
13817,Homer,okay.
21600,Homer,yes. thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
30571,Homer,we throw those out anyway.
41425,Homer,young me? what brings you to the present?
15136,Homer,chief justice of the supreme court. what great men he would join. john marshall... charles evans hughes... warren burger... mmm burger.
18484,Homer,you could live with grampa again.
37944,Homer,"and miss the back half of jimmy kimmel? that's when he experiments, boy."
35109,Homer,"well, it's not easy with you talking all the time."
37785,Homer,exactly. you always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
41195,Homer,"i see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... well, anything you say! good luck, lady! you're gonna need it!"
27216,Homer,"hey, get out, i'm in here! oh."
34659,Homer,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.
16826,Homer,"oh of course you'd say something like that, marge. you've hated ned for years. in fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
24377,Homer,i see...
14798,Homer,"oh, eh, i'll give it a chance."
26623,Homer,"for me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight."
40287,Homer,you mean -- ?
38176,Homer,don't worry. no one's gonna see this stupid show.
13595,Homer,i had a feeling it was too good to be true. every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
36560,Homer,"and if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero."
38310,Homer,"um. excuse me, lisa."
20652,Homer,"lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!"
15746,Homer,"but marge, the barflies are expecting me... moe, and barney and that guy who calls me bill..."
29671,Homer,"and it's something to be feared -- right, doctor?"
23950,Homer,"c'mon, bart. the coast guard is covering the doobs!"
32709,Homer,"wait, what's that smell? it's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water."
17848,Homer,"hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers i've heard so much about."
35889,Homer,"i'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. i..."
28844,Homer,"ahh, summer in tuscany."
24265,Homer,"well, i do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. oh, you can."
17073,Homer,"son, i know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
28542,Homer,i'll show flanders. i'm gonna get everyone a car. what's that one good american car?
21134,Homer,"uh, yeah, sure. that thing."
34767,Homer,"what is it? lenny, i'm on a second honeymoon. you'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. now, where were we?"
23766,Homer,"perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."
37523,Homer,"kids, i've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. sir, i need this train!"
18630,Homer,say. that ayatollah thinks he's better than america. is he right?
19796,Homer,"c'mon, bart. be a sport and kill blitzen, okay?"
15269,Homer,"son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. they're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! they smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! but you can't stop at one. you want to drink another woman!"
27788,Homer,"no, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
34232,Homer,"look at me! i'm flying, like superman's dog!"
24429,Homer,you'd better.
18542,Homer,"young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
19740,Homer,that john is the greatest guy in the world. we've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
14425,Homer,after i catch my breath... can we... go... home?
31379,Homer,this vibrating massage chair feels great!
16435,Homer,"foul temptress! i'll bet she thinks ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
22300,Homer,"well, at least they've already done me."
22148,Homer,gimme that knife!
37859,Homer,"what the-- ""the simpson bed and breakfast?"" i always wanted to stay in a place like this!"
14892,Homer,and look. new hair!
41545,Homer,"hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms!"
19537,Homer,"oh, marge, i've never felt so alone. no one believes me. uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""i believe you, homer."""
29617,Homer,wait a minute! are you two brother and sister?
23225,Homer,and look at this. a cheese grater!
34530,Homer,a churro you can eat in the shower?
16760,Homer,"hey guys, look what i smuggled aboard."
22097,Homer,nooo!
26965,Homer,you had me at comfort.
22949,Homer,"i see. well, i'll need some beer."
23156,Homer,piece o' cake. now where's that kid with my latte?
23176,Homer,"before ""lethal weapon 2"", i never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now i check every time."
17763,Homer,flanders! open up!
39714,Homer,marge. they're only space mutants.
34817,Homer,yes! i can fly! see you back at the house!
38830,Homer,"man, you are a nutcracker. but i've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on christmas? well, being without them is worse. can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
25115,Homer,food? i'm blind!
18283,Homer,"c'mon, i'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, i mean a veggie-back ride home."
20483,Homer,tell her the truth. you're not ready to get married.
19381,Homer,talk to me!!
40728,Homer,"ugh, gross. ecch."
26658,Homer,"oh man, they already voted. and we lost!"
19016,Homer,rules. i'm a rocker. i don't care for rules.
20297,Homer,i'm gonna chop you good!
39541,Homer,wha' th--
38459,Homer,"believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem."
22602,Homer,"we did a lisa thing last month. and i'm glad we did, but now i think we should do something normal people would like."
36362,Homer,why does every sand castle require my participation?
39753,Homer,"well, if you don't want it, i know someone who does."
15911,Homer,you mean there's a better way?
36685,Homer,"but we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. and fast!"
25477,Homer,"they said if i come in late again, i'm fired. i can't take that chance."
25333,Homer,"hey, that's great. listen, i need a new doubles partner. my little girl's a lead weight."
17846,Homer,australia! america! austr--
18518,Homer,"eighteen seconds, hmph. if this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. say, you're all shivering. are you cold or what?"
14598,Homer,"hey, down in front."
20593,Homer,"oh, yeah. you've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this...."
14421,Homer,"please, please, please..."
23669,Homer,mine tasted like strawberry.
29494,Homer,"you gotta get me closer, chief!"
23461,Homer,i bought these shoes from a hobo.
20653,Homer,"thanks, ted."
33875,Homer,you're not suggesting... murder.
38946,Homer,yeah you are too.
22195,Homer,you mean lisa?
26963,Homer,were they now?
39682,Homer,"avenge me, son. avenge my death."
17100,Homer,a bouquet of po...
18394,Homer,i...
25629,Homer,but i have finger insurance!
35355,Homer,selma? va-va-va-wha?!
36096,Homer,"man, oh man, look at this place! finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something."
30922,Homer,"ooh, a penny. this is my lucky day."
29315,Homer,what about that two-headed goat?
13389,Homer,i'm done.
16577,Homer,"okay, men, it's time to clean up this town."
17807,Homer,i am not krusty.
41366,Homer,"you have regrets, mr. ""i get to see the weathergirl from the side?"" i made the worst financial decision of all time. oh, i can't think about it, i won't think about it, i don't want to think about it..."
18557,Homer,"stealing?! how could you?! haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? captain what's-his-name? we live in a society of laws. why do you think i took you to all those ""police academy"" movies? for fun? well, i didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? except at that guy who made sound effects. where was i? oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"
26543,Homer,"fine, i'll cut off your ponytail."
29274,Homer,"look! it's mister cashew... the koobler dwarfs... snip, crinkle and poof..."
33441,Homer,oh no you don't!
28172,Homer,never mind. i'm death now.
13211,Homer,"squeaky, squeaky!"
31390,Homer,wow. troopers from every state in new england.
14464,Homer,maggie?
33144,Homer,kids?!
18597,Homer,"by the way, rhyming homer with homer..."
28796,Homer,"well, what do you know? it's unkillable."
21354,Homer,"i did it! i made it all the way to... aw, crap!"
24985,Homer,"oh, right, the magic. the magic was great. it's really... the way to go."
31248,Homer,mmm... extra-virgin...
32781,Homer,"not keys, cigarettes!"
35031,Homer,"sure, i'll stay home and skype with the guys at moe's."
30067,Homer,"begat. uh, do you have any books on the rapture?"
36961,Homer,"apes... deep down we're all savage apes. leave your body, homer."
21605,Homer,"a-- wait a minute! these aren't exciting new products! you're not even trying. okay, that's it. both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves."
39618,Homer,on my honor.
16824,Homer,"ah, for some reason, moe's is always closed on wednesdays."
15656,Homer,oh. right.
19979,Homer,"i'd like the phone book for hokkaido, japan, please."
25186,Homer,air?
13904,Homer,isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
26602,Homer,i'll regroup at red lobster!
20511,Homer,"oh, no you don't."
17123,Homer,"lisa! the blob has got me! don't touch me, or he'll get you too!"
35027,Homer,"ooh, i got a text!"
14429,Homer,alley balls...
28322,Homer,"you can't bet on my kids. this is america, pal!"
16585,Homer,no burning leaves without a permit!
30115,Homer,hm...
24572,Homer,son? daughter? i'm ever so sorry.
22560,Homer,"a three-chambered peanut! marge, look what i did! come quick! hurry! marge?"
23794,Homer,whoa-whoa-whoa! don't go nuts.
39081,Homer,"ooh, like fat albert."
22343,Homer,woo hoo! homer simpson with the pick!
16434,Homer,me too.
34954,Homer,don't tell me i'm not capable of good behavior!
38438,Homer,needs more numerators.
25136,Homer,you see? it's cool to be smart.
27311,Homer,you saved my life!
37673,Homer,"um... it says i should give you ""lumbar support."" better go to the lumberyard..."
40206,Homer,"i bet you could afford it, though."
30232,Homer,bwa?
26897,Homer,"oh, no! they're stealing the tire fire!"
34005,Homer,"well, well, well."
16421,Homer,what the hell was that? i probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy i found in the parking lot.
17958,Homer,"it's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
22082,Homer,nooooooooooo!
34762,Homer,woo hoo! another ladder!
28283,Homer,"la, la, la..."
37687,Homer,"once again, cats have it better."
38625,Homer,"well, i'm no carl when it comes to this stuff. but i ain't no lenny neither. and i would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt."
40848,Homer,bart!
36948,Homer,where'd they go?
27979,Homer,corporate jet?
20718,Homer,"hey, that's not fair! i wanna be a carny, too! can i, mister? huh? can i? please?"
23788,Homer,"okay, don't panic. remember what the instructor said..."
14765,Homer,come again?
34455,Homer,okay.
30544,Homer,"marge, without this outfit, i'm just homer simpson, multiple felon. with it, i'm a costumed hero like george washington or dame edna."
21664,Homer,"man, it feels good to get out of that car. ooo, go-carts! c'mon everybody, let's go."
30786,Homer,"well, it did its job. everyone's wearing blue pants now."
27910,Homer,ned's a stupid name! he's worse than frankenstein or dr. no.
19013,Homer,"anyway, get ready, beer belly! we're gonna show springfield what we're made of!"
18276,Homer,that's it. go to your room.
24690,Homer,"oh, don't worry. you'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. target date: january, 2007."
36028,Homer,"you know, i heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
22451,Homer,maarrge... president clinton!
17198,Homer,"marge, pour vous."
38349,Homer,kids are so afraid of being terminated.
29292,Homer,see?
41458,Homer,"um... ""webster's defines""... um... ""in the words of ted nugent""... ""school spirit""... ""next card""... ""the future""..."
28243,Homer,"welcome to your room, mom. i want you to stay here forever."
40771,Homer,hel-lo.
21060,Homer,"all right, all right, mellow out, everybody. the captain'll know what to do."
33622,Homer,"hello. it's me, lance romance."
23335,Homer,noooo!
41045,Homer,"marge, the dog is hungry!"
35215,Homer,it is so cool for you to let me go on tour with cheech.
18317,Homer,"i don't want to alarm you, marge..."
21298,Homer,i've never seen bart so ashamed of me.
19689,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
40846,Homer,"huh, wha'? oh, okay."
18946,Homer,"hi, everyone. if i could just say a few words... i'd be a better public speaker."
34434,Homer,messiah says !
38519,Homer,i got a bad sunburn and i was crapped on by a seagull / i don't see any lifeboats and i don't think that is legal
27091,Homer,"i'm so hot for me, i'm so hot for me / i'm so cold..."
21620,Homer,it can't be turned off.
35222,Homer,"oh yeah, i getcha -- ""work on the show."" maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? marijuana reference!"
13249,Homer,you were wrong... dead wrong.
34073,Homer,"finally, some peace and quiet."
22852,Homer,"frankly, i'd be a little turned on."
28902,Homer,"it's not all your fault. all these years, i watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet i did nothing. so in a way, i too am a victim... of you."
33921,Homer,was that tobey maguire?
14388,Homer,"what's your favorite song, lisa?"
19259,Homer,all right. just wake me up.
14902,Homer,marge keep it down in there.
13474,Homer,bart!
14241,Homer,there's a problem with the reactor?! we're all gonna die!!!
20548,Homer,now that's interesting.
16195,Homer,oh. pure genius. and now to make the leap from dreams to reality.
32191,Homer,"your lips red as flame, / your face with a luster / that puts gold to shame!"
36351,Homer,well...
16926,Homer,"nah, that's okay. i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out. first i'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
14281,Homer,"eh, somebody'll cover for me."
21037,Homer,bart!
34654,Homer,"oh marge, you not leaving with moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
36054,Homer,not you! him!
18146,Homer,"kids, would you step outside for a second?"
36922,Homer,he's still my dog!
14565,Homer,no.
16301,Homer,"mmmmm... ewwww.... mmmmm...ohhh... mmmmm... ahhhh. ooh, i think this was pizza."
26445,Homer,"bart, i couldn't help noticing buck is a total fraud. so i took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
24131,Homer,the hooligans!
33640,Homer,i miss you so much.
30530,Homer,"now honey, you know daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
39319,Homer,"that's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. hey, look at this! ""i am a weiner."" he sure is!"
28082,Homer,so you don't want to kill me anymore?
28048,Homer,"yes, i strut down the boulevard / burning off my excess lard..."
39810,Homer,"i-it's meaningless, marge. don't even attempt to find meaning in it. there's nothing between me and princess kashmir."
35066,Homer,"wish i could, son. i really wish i could."
40483,Homer,bart! what are you doing?
35749,Homer,"so, does this square us for kansas city?"
16843,Homer,"hey, what's up for today, neddie?"
21291,Homer,"sorry, son, daddy's down for the day. why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?"
24406,Homer,look. this is our chance.
29392,Homer,"you give my son what he deserves, or i'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
17215,Homer,"the whole trunk's full of 'em, marge."
19235,Homer,"hello, mr. burns, this is the kidnapper. do you miss your son?"
33822,Homer,i can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
18264,Homer,it's just a little dirty -- it's still good! it's still good!
36545,Homer,that was gonna be my next guess!
22603,Homer,"go ahead, sweetie."
28085,Homer,"now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to marge!"
36928,Homer,grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so i'd never get the toy i actually wanted--
14698,Homer,come with me!
29612,Homer,"but i'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
21867,Homer,"well, that settles it. for all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... line."
21067,Homer,"don't worry, i've been working on it. hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two..."
30439,Homer,this stinks! i've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
28971,Homer,"yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the hell up!"
24293,Homer,disgracefully hilarious! you passed out before we could even give you your presents.
23677,Homer,beautiful.
35488,Homer,"i know, i know you're not comfortable with all the guys edna's seen around town."
13324,Homer,"up... up... up... up... up... up. don't say anything, marge. let's just go to bed. i'm on the biggest roll of my life."
30356,Homer,why you very little...!
29911,Homer,"ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!"
35875,Homer,"yes, but i never use that kind of toothpaste!"
21083,Homer,"boy, i guess i was wrong about that earring. it saved us all."
16755,Homer,ants!
35192,Homer,"great idea, but i don't have any money."
36980,Homer,i guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
25023,Homer,"absolutely. we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
20695,Homer,okay.
14095,Homer,can i have a clean glass?
21399,Homer,stay there! i'll come down and save you!
29422,Homer,"hola, señor. we are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country."
30085,Homer,"exactly. it came to me in a vision. or maybe it was a drunken haze. or, possibly, an ice cream headache."
36232,Homer,what about this lemonade?
17876,Homer,"oh, marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
13984,Homer,oh marge.
34184,Homer,see you at five on the dot. phone kisses!
13850,Homer,sheesh. what a slave driver.
19067,Homer,we think we saw hugo at the airport! he was boarding a plane to switzerland and... oh.
17754,Homer,"i'm getting to that. so anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
41364,Homer,no i haven't!
40732,Homer,"eh, it's my metabmobolism. i guess i'm just one of the lucky ones."
32258,Homer,that's my car!
13520,Homer,"marge! really, what does it do?"
19734,Homer,"man, you should come over to our place. it's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
32527,Homer,six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend i actually got home at three a.m.
14236,Homer,"hey, why don't i apply at the nuclear power plant? i hear they pay pretty well."
37368,Homer,"padre, can i be honest with you? i've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. but there isn't."
33456,Homer,"boy, where are my zydeco records?"
21458,Homer,shhh. we're trespassing. and some of these farmers have pitchforks.
40488,Homer,that's my boy.
23243,Homer,uh-oh. somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
32585,Homer,my life's flashing before my eyes.
41512,Homer,bom bom bom bom
33098,Homer,how dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! bart! don't you dare take your eyes off that gameboy!
24173,Homer,"please, please, that's not necessary. i'm just god's messenger."
35156,Homer,"angry dad's voice is part walter matthau... hey, felix!... part little richard whoooo! ...and a little bit of snoopy when he cries."
23345,Homer,"don't worry. i've got a plan. okay, ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
28310,Homer,the place i was born is now a gator farm.
15888,Homer,"hello, dondelinger."
18938,Homer,please identify this object.
22320,Homer,six with the tip.
33806,Homer,"yes! yes! in your face, losers! this helicopter is taking off!"
34928,Homer,you'll be oh so pleased / when the o.j. is freshly-squeezed / and toast is made from homemade
27104,Homer,"no! no, i won't go! you can't make me!"
22410,Homer,"the whole town's laughin' at me. even that cat out there. bart, kill that cat!"
23504,Homer,"yes, it's the latest craze. try some, won't you?"
15910,Homer,"lisa, maybe if i'm part of that mob, i can help steer it in wise directions. now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?"
20580,Homer,"oh, that."
17950,Homer,"yeah, well i won the belching contest at work."
21671,Homer,"you're going down, you--"
31097,Homer,"not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with richard sakai."
13575,Homer,baby.
20827,Homer,and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
33603,Homer,"moe, something terrible has happened! the irish have become hardworking and sober!"
33166,Homer,she blew it again! woo-hoo!
22994,Homer,i envy them.
36195,Homer,"uh, marge, this is my friend keggy..."
24597,Homer,area code? but it's a local call.
27093,Homer,but rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
22682,Homer,"wait a minute. is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? i thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place."
33445,Homer,"book club? that's the most stupid boring thing ever. oh, thank you."
28156,Homer,"moe, i was just thinking, if maggie and i were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
28415,Homer,oh my god! lenny! carl! bart?
38737,Homer,"oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? it's so easy."
19846,Homer,"oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. what about that freezer lady in georgia?"
26308,Homer,broken jaw?
27511,Homer,"well, we could live with a stopped-up drain."
18830,Homer,"woo hoo! look, marge! a couple of bucks!"
15079,Homer,do you sell toys?
16955,Homer,"or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst."
27812,Homer,"oh, i hate this. it's making me use my arms."
30988,Homer,"hey, i've been driving drunk since i was twelve! but first...who's gonna help me pee?"
40328,Homer,"well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years."
40484,Homer,"you were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
38792,Homer,but i promised marge.
16678,Homer,that's even worse than the album grampa released.
14876,Homer,"son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers."
25896,Homer,"hey, knock it off! these pants cost six hundred dollars!"
37232,Homer,"bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! as your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, i forbid it!"
35260,Homer,"everybody dance now! do, do, do, do / do, do, do, do..."
39668,Homer,no.
18222,Homer,"ow! help me. why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
14946,Homer,too cold out!
21322,Homer,damn right.
27595,Homer,"aw, that's the dumbest thing i ever heard, you stupid little kid."
29163,Homer,bart! you promised you'd stop making that comparison.
16731,Homer,make it stop!
26289,Homer,"oh, they both make such good arguments."
14463,Homer,maggie?
28299,Homer,"marge, this is why people don't tell you things."
37780,Homer,"oh, it's cool. we did it in an elevator."
14312,Homer,"why, you little..."
36398,Homer,but you're not...
36859,Homer,are we still on for midnight bike riding?
18208,Homer,"okay, okay, don't panic. to find flanders, i just have to think like flanders!"
39592,Homer,uh-oh. you missed me.
20706,Homer,oo! oo! i want to see lobster boy and shrimp girl!
25714,Homer,"i don't know, i'm still a little hazy."
25916,Homer,woo hoo!
38614,Homer,pornography and nachos.
38465,Homer,why you little! i'll show you who's a flabbi!
40094,Homer,"uh, well okay, what the hey?"
32906,Homer,"i mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? does she know i feel bad about things i said?"
36463,Homer,i sure envy him.
26657,Homer,"so my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on tuesday the seventh..."
31227,Homer,then stand back!
18686,Homer,what's the point of going out? we're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
21615,Homer,"first, my all-purpose electric hammer. ""for all your pounding needs."""
18457,Homer,why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
28592,Homer,"oh man, this is so confusing."
27645,Homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
22229,Homer,"ned, no! think of your wives!"
21345,Homer,shut up. you are so fired.
24966,Homer,is that a steak?
22974,Homer,"but you know what? to be loved you have to be nice to people. every day! but, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
18336,Homer,eww. this is the worst place yet.
33607,Homer,"well, ""da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""
37695,Homer,i was gonna be king of cheeseburger mountain. did i change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? probably a little bit of both.
30999,Homer,...three... two... one... happy new year! my resolution is to be more fun!
27532,Homer,"bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
28105,Homer,"marge, you were an excellent peace-time chief. but these times call for men of cruelty."
39309,Homer,i'm warning you two!
27058,Homer,i don't remember anybody telling me i was gonna be on tv.
26486,Homer,turn that down! you call that music? i-- i just don't know what to do.
39465,Homer,"look at that, kids! no fighting, no yelling..."
23100,Homer,"i love this show. take that, you stupid hosers!"
14263,Homer,"holy cow, you're as big as a house."
24805,Homer,maybe for you. how come you didn't rescue me?
33981,Homer,marge... i bet we've got ten minutes till the kids wake up.
41191,Homer,"marge, you don't understand. i can't do it because... you're trapped. if you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! all right! i'll take her. lousy brain."
22105,Homer,"it's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."
17201,Homer,"oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. look at this bible i just got. fifteen bucks! and talk about a preachy book! everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
16207,Homer,more. mmmm.
14914,Homer,"marge, can i get some change for the candy machine?"
15343,Homer,"well, i guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
14371,Homer,"me too, honey."
21158,Homer,"that'll do it, apu. so just--"
16696,Homer,really?
40168,Homer,don't play dumb with me. we found your book.
14877,Homer,woo-hoo!
40217,Homer,"and some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
24449,Homer,"oo, my favorite door."
18817,Homer,for knocking mr. burns out a third story window.
27881,Homer,i don't know... date a chick with kids...
27068,Homer,you can't just leave me out here! there's not another woman for miles!
36815,Homer,those aren't our regular donuts! they're huge... with crazy toppings! gummy worms! churro chunks! russian nesting donut!
27067,Homer,where are you taking me?
41173,Homer,all right! woo woo! woo woo!
24672,Homer,somethin' wrong with your legs?
26544,Homer,"marge, it's called negotiating."
23864,Homer,"oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? oh, there's no such thing."
14145,Homer,"good, good, i'm learning."
13419,Homer,"a hundred bucks?! for a comic book? who drew it, micha-ma-langelo?"
26206,Homer,"give it to me, baby."
19331,Homer,all right.
39565,Homer,i am not. it's just that i couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. lisa! lisa!
27636,Homer,"i know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. there's the tongue-kissing festival... cinco de ocho... the hobo oscars... days just made for lovers. not widowers, lovers."
21344,Homer,"so nobody believes i can do this, huh? well, my son does. and i'm not gonna let him down. i'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
25554,Homer,ow! my eye!
40966,Homer,"oh, oh... i get it. okay. here's twenty bucks. now will you tell me where my brother lives?"
18867,Homer,"what?! how dare you! if i find out who this is, i'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to iran!"
40147,Homer,"marge! oh, marge!"
38352,Homer,"yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
15937,Homer,i'll figure it out. i'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
26127,Homer,and it's empty. put it back! i don't wanna see it this way.
41214,Homer,oooh.
28715,Homer,these charity address labels that came in the mail.
35390,Homer,yeah. but what if i can't find any commercial rental property?
13385,Homer,lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
23811,Homer,i got the groceries!
15734,Homer,hm. alcohol fueled car.
33945,Homer,i knew it!
30619,Homer,i get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
40778,Homer,i'm... a spare. excuse me.
20308,Homer,"yes, yes, oh god yes!"
22726,Homer,the trucks drive themselves?
31533,Homer,scottsdale? will we stay at a tripletree resort?
14730,Homer,let's hear it.
30909,Homer,"tonight on jock center: a slugger on 'roids, tiger woods is annoyed, and north korean missiles deployed!"
17636,Homer,i'm out.
27662,Homer,stay plugged in! i will find you!
27927,Homer,how many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
14210,Homer,... ...
32100,Homer,why are you applauding them? we wrote it!
37396,Homer,"well, i can't part with a single one of my ""hoarders""! hands off my episodes of ""episodes,"" and if you delete ""revenge""..."
24808,Homer,"shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey."
19783,Homer,"hunting, eh?"
34830,Homer,the march of progress.
17891,Homer,it means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
17885,Homer,"all right, you'll get your money."
23152,Homer,ah-ah-ah! now here's your biggest problem of all...
23906,Homer,"oh, why won't anyone give me an award?"
18588,Homer,"i don't know. you know, some guy. otto, i guess."
35409,Homer,"oh my god. like mozart and johnny knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!"
34896,Homer,"nicely done, boy."
16256,Homer,your point being?
23001,Homer,up-bup-bup-bup.
17332,Homer,"ah, the mysteries of life."
15406,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
37202,Homer,you won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
32371,Homer,"oh ma-arge! want some com-pany? as always, silence means yes."
25735,Homer,"daddy's not here, is he?"
40912,Homer,"marge, i'm only human. now look, here's what we're gonna do. we'll unload the kids on patty and selma saturday night. and then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. just like old times."
25587,Homer,go.
18560,Homer,"check it out, boy! it's like looking into a living snow mirror!"
19386,Homer,"your beautiful kitchen, ned. just as you remember it."
28891,Homer,"aw, shut up, captain bringdown."
27669,Homer,looks like we're in for nasty weather...
22260,Homer,"hello, little birdie."
27890,Homer,"but it was marge. my first and only love. i'm like david spade without chris farley, alone and useless!"
25358,Homer,go. blow.
19276,Homer,i don't care if he was filling in for mel zetz! he's my son and i don't want him --
23833,Homer,"here you go, lad."
30620,Homer,don't worry. we got the cheese insurance.
23004,Homer,now you're sure this will save my marriage?
40852,Homer,bart!
37602,Homer,what everything's been building toooo /
26229,Homer,"a library selling books? if i don't want 'em for free, why would i want to pay for 'em?"
14570,Homer,"yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
23790,Homer,"ow, my legs! this is the worst pain ever..."
21590,Homer,and i'm starting right now. no more lousy pajamas!
31349,Homer,gung hay fat choi! gung hay fat choi!
31511,Homer,your present is leaving.
21133,Homer,uhmmmm... errr... uhhhhh...
18753,Homer,"no, it's homer."
27922,Homer,this dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
16356,Homer,"ah, mcgarnigal. eases the pain."
28709,Homer,"all i know is the guy who played mozart was also in ""animal house."" now there's a movie with good music. animal house house house... / nobody ever went to class... / then we saw donald sutherland's ass... / animal house house house... /"
39925,Homer,perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
25569,Homer,"by the way, what kind of blood is this?"
36744,Homer,give it to me! / i can imagine it. / give me the gun! /
23195,Homer,"okay, mr. difficult. how about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
26830,Homer,"aw, the poor thing's in pain. what he needs is a visit from kindly old dr. foot."
35664,Homer,i need a nap!
29111,Homer,"marge, i'm really sorry i hurt you. but i've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun i hid from you, the time i sued the church, ruining lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
27153,Homer,put pie here.
37247,Homer,what about christian archie comics?
14515,Homer,god --
32039,Homer,"oh god, my gums! they hurt so much!"
40430,Homer,"...and, lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. you saw what happened. oh, lord, be honest. are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?"
17909,Homer,nobody make me any breakfast. a man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
25834,Homer,she's not the boss of me.
16090,Homer,"heh heh. ""nee."""
15037,Homer,"well, i want that one."
28348,Homer,a secret tunnel? i don't know. won't that get me in more trouble?
28195,Homer,"yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! like getting the rat out of maggie's room!"
34478,Homer,"chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm..."
38870,Homer,to earth!
24516,Homer,"ohhhh, mister. porky."
34068,Homer,gotta leave early to beat the traffic. now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. for crying out--
30470,Homer,"excuse me, mr. bartender sir, may i have a sugar-free ginger ale? and uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds."
18025,Homer,now it's two sets of twins.
18767,Homer,i think smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when i'm around.
30062,Homer,"yeah, i'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. thanks marge, you've put my mind at ease. now how about a little ""rapture"" for mama?"
41464,Homer,"huh... well, two can play at that game!"
24858,Homer,"you'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not."
16138,Homer,i'm writing a delicious send up of mr. burns for his birthday party. is poo poo one word or two?
14084,Homer,"i'd rather have a ""flaming homer""."
18541,Homer,"or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst."
31415,Homer,this is the most fun i've ever had giving you wood.
39329,Homer,oh.
36182,Homer,"kids, there's something i have to tell you -- your mother and i are wetting the bed."
17686,Homer,and only one of you kids can go to college.
13900,Homer,wow!
32924,Homer,"three o'clock. goodbye, mom. you're finally free."
36793,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders."
32437,Homer,marge won't dump me. i'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
19953,Homer,it's all right. i understand. but we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
41223,Homer,okay. don't use reverse psychology.
17298,Homer,nooooo!
26220,Homer,talk about what? sports? bigamy?
39709,Homer,what? oh yeah. you were great.
19483,Homer,the lighthouse keeper!
16027,Homer,ew. this coffee's too hot.
36025,Homer,"did you say ""ultimate frisbee?"""
30315,Homer,poor dumb country mouse. can't even count.
18893,Homer,"oh, bad dog! bad dog!"
41525,Homer,"with you, baby, top ramen tastes like cup o' noodles."
15512,Homer,"simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree"
38911,Homer,that would explain a lot. but why did you do it?
25639,Homer,"hey, thanks for stopping."
17368,Homer,they hid them in every millionth krusty klump bar and krusty klump bar with almonds.
30524,Homer,safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
23627,Homer,"i'm sorry, maggie. i never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
13661,Homer,nah.
18589,Homer,"marge, you're missing the point. the individual doesn't matter. it was a team effort and i was the one who came up with the whole team idea. me."
21115,Homer,"how 'bout you, lenny? testing, testing? lenny?"
40323,Homer,"there's nothing wrong with crabgrass! it just has a bad name, that's all. everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass."
27328,Homer,mm... trophy.
23113,Homer,salt water seems to be good for it.
25296,Homer,it's gonna be tough without a partner.
39566,Homer,"lisa, what did i tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?"
20502,Homer,but you can't leave! we're scammin' an old lady at my house and i need a place to hide out.
19447,Homer,"this is 'cause i kicked you, isn't it?"
33472,Homer,that poor man. is he okay?
21116,Homer,maybe. but first i need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
13979,Homer,"ooooooh, mcbain."
14819,Homer,herb?
13167,Homer,"good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
28641,Homer,it's stuck! krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!
27901,Homer,christmas in december / wow wow wow / give me tons of presents / now now now!
33710,Homer,"son, girls come and go. but you'll always have your family."
18107,Homer,"boy, when marge first told me she was going to the police academy, i thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""spaceballs."" but instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""police academy."""
38063,Homer,but it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
15144,Homer,thataboy.
14521,Homer,"fiddle dee dee. that will require a tetanus shot. i'm not going to swear, but i am going to kick this doghouse down."
19392,Homer,"oh, him."
33939,Homer,"nag, nag, nag."
28032,Homer,"you see? before, i probably would have driven to the syrup."
26133,Homer,why? he'd just bury it.
41284,Homer,"a cookie! no, a car! no, a cookie!"
32111,Homer,"okay. uh... well uh... hm, i just uh. i forget what i do."
19217,Homer,and what if he's not? then we'd look like idiots.
14829,Homer,"wait a minute. i'm not signing anything until i read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
29645,Homer,"eh, they'll be fine."
23787,Homer,uh-oh.
15488,Homer,i got a bad heart.
20441,Homer,"not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, flanders?"
31728,Homer,"well, here we are, home early."
17230,Homer,parents island?
27658,Homer,get... out of my... airspace!
13322,Homer,uh oh.
33327,Homer,"use as many big words as possible. i call ""computer."" bart, you can have ""doorbell."""
39167,Homer,"and the older one, i can't tell her what to do. and she's only twelve."
33815,Homer,oh yeah.
19142,Homer,uh... yessir. no problemo.
34501,Homer,"don't worry, sarah. clancy was there for me. and i'll be there for him."
33464,Homer,"hey, flanders. listen, uh... we're having a party..."
34904,Homer,i mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
18310,Homer,huh? i never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
17154,Homer,"bees are on the what, now?"
32237,Homer,"get lost, you waste of a moustache!"
36344,Homer,"thank you all for coming to my ""stranded"" discussion group!"
25668,Homer,"ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime."
29903,Homer,"all right, then you can just look at the portrait i painted of him."
24459,Homer,"now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
25218,Homer,five? why don't we make it fifty?
27429,Homer,what do i do now?
37444,Homer,no.
25957,Homer,very little.
27057,Homer,"all right, time for my favorite show."
40472,Homer,"come on marge, we're mad at 'im."
30373,Homer,can't even go in my own kitchen... bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
24819,Homer,i'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
22440,Homer,tie good. you like shirt?
21810,Homer,"really? you giant stars consider me a friend? well, for the first time in my life i feel like i'm somebody. ronny, are you also my close friend?"
31057,Homer,"all right, marge... time to remember admiral awesome!"
33509,Homer,my own devices!
40868,Homer,"son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. it's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. i want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again."
16236,Homer,"marjorie, please. i enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. ahhh, ballet."
24503,Homer,good.
32076,Homer,"i know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. for years now, fox has been--"
40487,Homer,"i mean it, boy."
29813,Homer,deal!
24618,Homer,"now, i'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town!"
31476,Homer,"oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. but you still have to go."
17235,Homer,i kicked a giant mouse in the butt. do i have to draw you a diagram?
26874,Homer,what? it goes right by our house.
25869,Homer,it's a little tight.
33422,Homer,now let's get something to eat.
19220,Homer,"and i think it's the best idea i've ever had! we're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
31993,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!"
14851,Homer,they do good work.
14360,Homer,whoo-hoo!
17643,Homer,couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
32211,Homer,"hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor..."
31384,Homer,do not mention that publication in this house! they never published my poem!
36694,Homer,"listen, do you know this man?"
29749,Homer,dammit!
19328,Homer,"marge, i'm home! where are you? are you okay? i don't smell dinner!"
17642,Homer,"hm... i could help others. i'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war ."
31555,Homer,"all night long, baby."
39651,Homer,"through here, boy. back to civilization."
33971,Homer,i couldn't help it! she knew my one weakness -- that i'm weak!
40126,Homer,homer marge
21916,Homer,woo hoo!
19616,Homer,that worked sooo well.
14160,Homer,"well, ah, i wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
25697,Homer,rich laughing with poor...
36681,Homer,that's where we live!
24422,Homer,but i was just...
13466,Homer,"bill... bill... summons... bill... wait a minute. from c.m. burns? is this it? yes, this is it! woo-hoo! woo!"
20846,Homer,ever heard of a little thing called the internet?
18749,Homer,"come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
15915,Homer,my name is mr. burns.
22802,Homer,"no, no, i'm into chicken."
37253,Homer,"oh yeah. i say ""union"" you say ""power""! union..."
31120,Homer,"you, stupid..."

18862,Homer,"boy, lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. i don't know how i'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
32305,Homer,and all the transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. the end.
31290,Homer,son! let me have a lick at you.

34048,Homer,"i'll make it up to you, marge, i swear."

24914,Homer,who are all these oddballs?
40934,Homer,wha...?
21087,Homer,no.
26871,Homer,i'd stab somebody for a pickle.
28174,Homer,"pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... take an dirt nap. feed the worms..."
31875,Homer,sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.
17835,Homer,"psh, that's no reason to block the tv."
26986,Homer,"twenty-three. now, today i'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with bart and girl it up with lisa."
32444,Homer,"hey, the networks have different channels in this city."
34920,Homer,"marge is mia? oh my god, she changed her name?"
23374,Homer,"eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
25322,Homer,"no, of course not. now aim for your mother's heart."
40095,Homer,"karl, you gotta help me. mr. burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?"
37120,Homer,finally! a supervisor!
23846,Homer,"huh? springfield university homecoming! finally, a chance to relive my golden college years..."
39459,Homer,yes.
14019,Homer,"loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
24981,Homer,"well, you're the mark."
19950,Homer,lisa! you have a guest!
25151,Homer,"it's bill pullman, you fool!"
18566,Homer,ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.

27167,Homer,not if i can stop that inauguration!
34955,Homer,"your honor, i would like to request a sidebar."
13424,Homer,no.
29763,Homer,"sorry, marge. we've got the power now. and you can't turn us off!"
22003,Homer,duh.
23393,Homer,uh... shiny mcshine?
34492,Homer,impressive.
14853,Homer,"wait, marge. didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
28917,Homer,no son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
17422,Homer,maybe tv is right. tv's always right.
32147,Homer,"no, it's, uh... good news!"
20514,Homer,mmm. who knew that lay's made liquid potato chips? i can't suck just one.
16189,Homer,"eh, it's about the same. uh-oh! look out, smithers!"
28743,Homer,"butt on bowl, little man!"
36629,Homer,are you sure there isn't more? i mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
25076,Homer,do you have airbags?
40749,Homer,uh-huh.
15363,Homer,ye-esss...
30268,Homer,where's your sense of magic and wonder?
27939,Homer,that's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
28382,Homer,flanderses!
33179,Homer,yeah.
19093,Homer,"but marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream."
30821,Homer,so many paddles.
37219,Homer,what's wrong?
29346,Homer,pretend to care!
16463,Homer,"lisa, look out behind you!"
28488,Homer,joe dimaggio?
40020,Homer,"oooh, ""gorilla, the conqueror."" the granddaddy of them all."
20300,Homer,"that sounds like witch talk to me, lisa."
15887,Homer,at our next high school reunion i'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
26819,Homer,you're right.
22382,Homer,"gee... i never thought i'd say this about a tv show, but this is kinda stupid. hey, ""policecops."" that sounds like a lethal combination."
28072,Homer,i see. do you have any suggestions?
22997,Homer,who told you?
32231,Homer,"that's it! let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to marge and you can never, ever have it. this opera's over when the fat man sings."
33540,Homer,why did i bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
34416,Homer,ned!
14950,Homer,"ahhh. i'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. i never want to leave this bed. uh-oh. gotta take a whiz. think, man, think... think, think, think. i better get up."
21890,Homer,"okay, if i'm gonna be a real hippie, i have to learn from the master, mr. bob ""flower child"" hope."
24804,Homer,i know.
39646,Homer,"that's nice, lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. we're in the woods."
17339,Homer,"oh! ooh my - oh, the hell with it."
23314,Homer,"people change, marge. my palate has grown more sophisticated."
22010,Homer,"whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
13187,Homer,did he have any hobbies?
13561,Homer,"hey, michael, i don't get it. these guys seem as normal as you and me."
30651,Homer,maybe he's cheating on us with the episcopalians.
14966,Homer,"come on tv... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
26957,Homer,"yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. i'm giving this badge to the next guy i see."
20748,Homer,"yes, but first there's a little matter of the carny code."
27401,Homer,"uh, lance uppercut."
15244,Homer,"...all you can eat, ha!"
30290,Homer,don't laugh! they're doing the best they can.
41503,Homer,"wow! look at me, er uh, mom! i am, 'er uh, president kennedy!"
29943,Homer,"and if i wanna watch it, what day?"
36774,Homer,woo hoo!
14069,Homer,"well, it's called a ""flaming..."
29570,Homer,"after my makeover i'm gonna get you, boy."
17505,Homer,"wow, classy."
22452,Homer,"me, too. let's sing the cinderella song."
24057,Homer,"and poor ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. well, from now on i'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much i love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. maybe just a pat on the butt. yeah, that works."
22430,Homer,"max power / he's the man / whose name you'd love to touch / but you mustn't touch / his name sounds good in your ear / but when you say it, you mustn't fear / 'cause his name can be said by anyone..."
25838,Homer,"yeah, that's the price of success."
35655,Homer,and check these out...
27893,Homer,"oh, yeah. the night that destroyed my marriage."
31074,Homer,"marge, i realize you've made up your mind, and i want you to know that i deeply respect your boo!"
37856,Homer,"oh good. marge remarried after i died. wait a minute, i'm not dead. what's goin' on?"
20902,Homer,relax. all i smell is garlic and fish.
31171,Homer,but i wanted to do it with you.
39416,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
21903,Homer,"profits, profits, profits! what kinda hippies are you? peter fonda must be spinning in his grave."
18515,Homer,"go on, maggie. go. go."
24312,Homer,take me home.
15003,Homer,no sale.
23868,Homer,what? i can see fine.
32127,Homer,handyman's choice copper tubing?
39658,Homer,"the first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness."
23799,Homer,gotcha! gotcha! / i'll show you!
28910,Homer,that's right. i got a job here so i can watch over you like a mother hen.
37564,Homer,swag! i'm gonna grab forever / stuff that i really don't need / swag!
17820,Homer,uh... actually my name is barney. yeah. barney gumbel.
20938,Homer,"moe! oh, moe, thank god you're here!"
15457,Homer,"questions? questions? oh gee, my whole scheme down the... i mean, ask away."
31681,Homer,the light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
38469,Homer,"yeah, yeah, great. i guess my getting-up days are over."
14404,Homer,"look lisa, i bought you a malibu stacey chinchilla coat."
31320,Homer,i'm proud of what i achieved during my rioting.
13368,Homer,they're holding it at catfish lake. they couldn't call it catfish lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
19068,Homer,"lookin' good, son."
39972,Homer,"ba, ba / ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba..."
27797,Homer,oh my god! space monsters are invading us!
20445,Homer,"great debut, son. you really settled in after some early jitters."
21989,Homer,"uh-huh. pinchy would have wanted it this way. my dear, sweet pinchy. no more pain where you are now, boy."
35196,Homer,cheech and chong are coming back to springfield?
14714,Homer,a friend bought it for me.
21044,Homer,"damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! can't we all just get along?"
27481,Homer,yes...
16503,Homer,we got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
31952,Homer,i hope it's spaghetti!
20410,Homer,"yes. mr. koufax, don't you think flanders is a big jerk? y'ello? y'ello?"
22022,Homer,"well now that's what i always thought, but somehow..."
32475,Homer,huh? why do i look like me again?
31764,Homer,aw. our kids used to be so cute!
22296,Homer,"okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."
15423,Homer,my heart is just fine...
25828,Homer,"i know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, irish-style!"
31855,Homer,"son, i'll never understand women if i live to be forty."
15724,Homer,do i ever!
19110,Homer,"yes sir, i will notice that. very casual, mr. scorpion."
15259,Homer,no!
32418,Homer,"a song? wait, it's coming back to me."
24506,Homer,and that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
14994,Homer,"don't worry, sweetheart. if i'm wrong, i'll recant on my deathbed."
24402,Homer,look out for what?
35908,Homer,i am homer simpson.
31827,Homer,...our duties as firemen.
32158,Homer,i'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
20476,Homer,i understand. yoink. wow...
26873,Homer,i'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
36094,Homer,by the box lady herself!
38222,Homer,the two thousand eight super bowl?
23449,Homer,"com'on, maw. bring the young 'uns! there's no leeches! lots of snakes, though."
40318,Homer,okay. i wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
14182,Homer,"no, everything's fine. your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
16476,Homer,"oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
40283,Homer,this was the biggest decision the simpsons ever faced. i should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
27096,Homer,i'm entitled to a private life! i'm not a role model! and so forth.
24614,Homer,"uh, i have a question, phoney."
15739,Homer,i think i've lost weight.
18407,Homer,there. there. you found the floor.
16983,Homer,"uh-huh. and ""if""?"
25372,Homer,i wanna go home now.
18171,Homer,careful now.
26856,Homer,cover for me.
34107,Homer,"more vicodin and eggs, please."
19370,Homer,hurricane! somehow the animals are always the first to know.
35153,Homer,"don't feel bad, boy. everyone makes mistakes. yours is just public and expensive."
16346,Homer,"thank you. very, very much."
40321,Homer,who told? marge! beer me!
19635,Homer,oh... okay.
18273,Homer,"lisa, tell your mother to get off my case."
24363,Homer,"okay. ""there's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. do you a) none of the below, b)..."""
18289,Homer,"i paid for a colossal donut, and i'm gonna get a colossal donut."
25863,Homer,coooool.
14762,Homer,"hey, wiener boy... where do you think you're going?"
22147,Homer,look out!
17614,Homer,everything lasts forever.
34394,Homer,"ned, i'm an american tourist. i'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my carolina panthers credit card."
25637,Homer,"where's marge?! that is so rude. i know, i'll hitchhike."
19932,Homer,you gave both dogs away?! you know how i feel about giving!
32377,Homer,"oh, i'm not decent. let me throw something on!"
27560,Homer,"why you little...! um, i'm sorry, judge. that's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."
24392,Homer,biatch? moi?
37615,Homer,"ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
17122,Homer,yaaarr--ewwwwwww!!
37985,Homer,reality!
21979,Homer,"what's your problem, veggie? you don't even eat lobster."
16601,Homer,we'll be right back.
25308,Homer,don't touch me. your hands feel like salad tongs.
17738,Homer,i can't go on with this charade any longer. i hate my job. i hate my life. and ever since i found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
18639,Homer,"okay, let's give it up for the new guy. now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. hello? hello?"
20242,Homer,stupid hippo.
30526,Homer,"did i hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'cause heeere they are!"
37167,Homer,"marge, can i get a subscription to highlights magazine?"
33478,Homer,and it was gooood.
30331,Homer,"i, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
40296,Homer,wow! that's service!
16704,Homer,"hey, there's still time. let's hug him again."
17871,Homer,if only i could think of an invention. something that would really make money. must concentrate and work harder than i've ever worked...
17009,Homer,"dad, that will never work. if you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
33283,Homer,"boy, don't blow up this mall! it has the cookie store that gives free samples!"
24037,Homer,"yeah, she's the best. ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
13487,Homer,"well, it's somewhere! it didn't just get up and walk away!"
29868,Homer,"finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women."
20675,Homer,maybe so. but there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. this washcloth.
22155,Homer,get out of the way you--
18683,Homer,"sold! you wrap it up, i'll start bringin' in the pennies."
38801,Homer,maybe marge would forgive me if i won the lotto. give me a scratcher.
25143,Homer,stop that! the fire inspector would be appalled.
40619,Homer,i want fugu!
34130,Homer,"marge, my brain is like a computer, and i file away grampa's stories in a very special place."
27730,Homer,but the book said you would applaud my initiative.
19425,Homer,hot! hot!
19408,Homer,"lenny? aw, well. if it was big and annual i'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
38747,Homer,cover...
24086,Homer,and his own car? that's ned flanders.
38629,Homer,"oh yeah, great. great, marge. great work. thanks to you, springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
32130,Homer,i got the job!
14943,Homer,leggo! leggo!
35802,Homer,uh... i got here after you did.
36639,Homer,another thing that would be harder with four kids.
15433,Homer,whew! i was afraid it was my transmission.
22556,Homer,where's your keys? i'm takin' your car to work.
25153,Homer,i'm a spaulding gray in a rick dees world. change me back to the blissful boob i was!
23174,Homer,"quick, mel, get in!"
35976,Homer,"marge, if you were married to da vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to da vinch."
38967,Homer,why you little--
33766,Homer,you're no help.
33479,Homer,"uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. i left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner."
29478,Homer,"oh marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?"
17773,Homer,and it was a baby ox.
15655,Homer,look! there's another disadvantaged boy.
38073,Homer,because it's his home forever.
23625,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you can trust me."
27244,Homer,"look, we can't give up. we're on tv. and when you're on tv, you dig in your claws and you never let go. just like bill moyers!"
35495,Homer,"yeah, right. a baby shot a guy."
28165,Homer,i'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
31975,Homer,sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.
25278,Homer,"okay, now some of that is me."
38106,Homer,"okay. you know, i love him too. in a manly way that never shows itself."
39102,Homer,i was distinctly promised no math!
39882,Homer,"affectionate little albanian, isn't he?"
14541,Homer,"well, this year's gonna be different."
32257,Homer,at first i thought you were pointing to your crotch.
25654,Homer,abra-ca-thumbra.
40245,Homer,"oh, that's okay. the baby's name isn't important. let's go, marge."
16120,Homer,"actually, i've been working on a plan. during the exam, i'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
37309,Homer,"oh my god! a marriage so perfect that i could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. what do i do?! what do i do?!"
30717,Homer,but i'm not tired!
21833,Homer,uh-oh.
20168,Homer,oh no we don't! judge snyder?
40663,Homer,"no, i don't want-a..."
31105,Homer,"hey, flanders! thanks for saving our place."
24226,Homer,"yeah, but just for a minute. it's a funny story; i'll tell you sometime."
27217,Homer,i go by how funny the sign is.
15509,Homer,bart!
14268,Homer,you the boss?
14465,Homer,maggie?
26434,Homer,"hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
33034,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
33828,Homer,waverly hills / that's where i want to be / squatting in waverly hills. / waverly hills / get education fraudulently / moochin' off waverly hills.
40936,Homer,"ah, moe. i've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, selma."
21423,Homer,"look, honey, i clipped on my tie all by myself."
39137,Homer,"aw, your leaves are drooping. here, let me turn that gloom into bloom."
16640,Homer,"yep, well, that's what got me where i am today."
38937,Homer,okay.
33960,Homer,"the one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! ohhh."
21594,Homer,"at my age edison had already invented 203 things. ohh, i've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him."
36854,Homer,"oh man, my goatee has barely come in. why does my hair only grow in twos?"
23315,Homer,oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... gotta go!
19533,Homer,"you are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. if i wasn't married, i'd go out with you like that."
13205,Homer,thank you.
29601,Homer,"have you read them all? okay, good."
23822,Homer,what's wrong with us?!
30325,Homer,what man would want this now?!
40907,Homer,oops.
28897,Homer,where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?
21009,Homer,then i'll do it!
30241,Homer,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
26213,Homer,"please, just leave me alone."
23514,Homer,we all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. the least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
36597,Homer,"well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. when do you think things first went wrong?"
37694,Homer,"back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. i picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. we'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
22744,Homer,we'll get past that barrier somehow. ol' blinky here will find a way.
35102,Homer,"now all you need are customers. well, better get home to the little woman."
15981,Homer,then came the greatest thrill of my life.
31997,Homer,i'm okay.
17492,Homer,you know what?
36204,Homer,"exactly like chandler, always criticizing."
17338,Homer,"lisa, if the bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
22057,Homer,whew.
21941,Homer,that's no fun.
29262,Homer,how 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
40520,Homer,i didn't know they still made tv dinners this bad.
34337,Homer,must win fight... must win fight...
37233,Homer,why does everything i forbid always happen?
28906,Homer,i believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
40125,Homer,i'm everything you need /
35395,Homer,is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
14319,Homer,"well, it's more than you did!"
36814,Homer,"don't you, drawing?"
31871,Homer,"i hate shopping. i'm bored, my feet hurt, i'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
13936,Homer,no!
23329,Homer,pedestrian.
38534,Homer,"oh marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. man, if only you could do that with bart."
20031,Homer,"yeah, that's me all right. and the guy standing next to me is president gerald ford. and this is when i was on tour with the smashing pumpkins. oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
14677,Homer,yeah...
14365,Homer,and don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. crumbled up cookie things...
14220,Homer,"marge, we can't do that! all the kids'll call him larry fairy."
13502,Homer,"well, i'm still gonna run!"
35114,Homer,"so basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. like west virginia does for virginia."
13932,Homer,there it is.
19201,Homer,"aw, c'mon, i'll make a fortune for one night's work! we could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
15838,Homer,"over there."""
14233,Homer,our first night together as man and wife.
26230,Homer,i don't know.
18751,Homer,"oh yeah? well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
35062,Homer,someday you'll understand that i'm just being a good dad.
15589,Homer,sounds great!
25380,Homer,but... the tv gave me the impression that...
20499,Homer,please? it's just for as long as his mother's living here.
15693,Homer,"c'mon, boy! finish him off!"
21950,Homer,hurry up. my hands are getting cold.
22207,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll figure it out. this isn't rocket science."
38458,Homer,"then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!"
20039,Homer,"yeah, yeah, that's his problem. he's a nut. it's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
33241,Homer,i guess i have no choice.
13333,Homer,"hey, flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
14135,Homer,fifty-two hundred dollars? what are you talking about?
32057,Homer,okay.
17197,Homer,who? oh.
35397,Homer,these are really good scissors.
38809,Homer,"aw, thanks for your honesty, apu. is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
29952,Homer,and what time? would be a good time to see it?
36486,Homer,you wanna honk your jazz tube?
20574,Homer,"ahh, i love these lazy saturdays."
39611,Homer,no.
29376,Homer,"sweetie, that's orphan talk."
13605,Homer,those kids don't know what they're missing.
14339,Homer,"okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
37189,Homer,"son, promise you will never look like me."
30749,Homer,boy! push down on the bumper! then i can back the car up and save myself.
33539,Homer,"whoever's biting me, stop it!"
25993,Homer,"and it would look pretty, too."
26768,Homer,"i know, can you believe it? oh, manjula's just gonna die!"
22094,Homer,"i said, ""woo hoo."""
39861,Homer,the boy. bring me the boy.
21469,Homer,"um, no time like the present."
16296,Homer,oh my god. they're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. and it's all my fault!
33324,Homer,"toldja, marge. tol. dja."
34306,Homer,leave me alone! i have shares to crop!
13825,Homer,"lisa, that was very selfish of you."
39850,Homer,ahhhhhh!
38183,Homer,"what you need, my friend, is a canadian duff. beauty, eh?"
36875,Homer,"oh, marge, it's bad."
35291,Homer,"oh son, i can't quit drinking any more than i could quit being a man."
15539,Homer,the wicked witch.
15847,Homer,gotcha! it's april fool's for two more minutes!
32575,Homer,what if you just moved the bottle?
19737,Homer,ow! why you little...
29746,Homer,"well, i invented a popsicle made of mountain dew."
22868,Homer,it's glorious! the streets are paved with water. you could ride a walrus to work!
24219,Homer,"moe, the new duff calendars are out! the ones with your picture!"
39622,Homer,all right. all right! i'll take it.
30589,Homer,burns' mansion?! that's mr. burns' mansion!
36669,Homer,"look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
27525,Homer,sweet.
39971,Homer,"ba, ba / ba, ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba / ba, ba ba!"
39948,Homer,oooh.

21375,Homer,museum? i don't like the sound of that. what did your mother say?
31807,Homer,how could you publish this? i thought we were friends!
13567,Homer,"oh great! and uh, try to put a good face on this. tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
18577,Homer,"ooh, i've got to get the third degree from you, too?"
31083,Homer,you idiot!
35194,Homer,problem solved. generation awesome does it again!
19269,Homer,"oh, i don't know how to punish you! what does marge usually do?"
28436,Homer,a line for the bathroom? what gives?
31208,Homer,and a circus fire!
30395,Homer,trucks are like big cars.
36457,Homer,"tonight, you shall be at my right hand in heaven."
27578,Homer,what the-- where the hell is my sugar?!
20207,Homer,"excellente! muchas gracias, señorata!"
13265,Homer,"my son, i have some shocking news. i was murdered. murdered, i tells ya!"
21239,Homer,can't someone else do it?
37865,Homer,i thought they were just gonna watch me.
40411,Homer,bart! stop fighting with your sister!
36305,Homer,sure. what's your name?
33523,Homer,i really hate this neighborhood.
23705,Homer,"i know, i know. just tune her out."
14356,Homer,... miles per hour.
29493,Homer,but i have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
31450,Homer,woo hoo! i'm gonna be on time!
26435,Homer,"no kidding? hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
16217,Homer,sure did.
37236,Homer,hey flanders. can i borrow some sugar?
21860,Homer,"in closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. and when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. thank you, your honor."
28635,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty unreliable."
21993,Homer,"there, problem solved."
15454,Homer,"hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?"
27151,Homer,mmm... feed...
14657,Homer,"look who's oinking! ""look who's oinking""!"
22606,Homer,what? and marmaduke doesn't?
36755,Homer,"aw, that's tooth fairy money down the drain, sweetie. i never win anything. it's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of."
17698,Homer,mmm... bowling fresh.
19624,Homer,"you got it, buddy."
33249,Homer,that's it! ruin a perfect evening!
35351,Homer,"come on, bart. we've been out here for hours."
39397,Homer,wow. they listened to me.
17076,Homer,"all right, we're breaking early tonight, class. for tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa's diary."
41542,Homer,"hey, i worked hard all day to pay for your education. can't i get all zima-ed up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?"
18932,Homer,i never should have bought this button. can i have my three dollars back?
19518,Homer,"no! well, ten beers..."
37107,Homer,"marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. but those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. and now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them."
31068,Homer,so beautiful. i wish i could understand italian.
34069,Homer,"i hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!"
25891,Homer,"ow, my head... oh. i need a beer."
36932,Homer,bongo was happy. without me. he had become her dog.
29090,Homer,i'm so lame!
34094,Homer,"girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and i don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause i don't know."
33693,Homer,now what?
40885,Homer,"bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! now go to your room."
28213,Homer,i wish! look at this headline.
27185,Homer,i fell off. hee hee hee.
35561,Homer,cold. so cold.
41533,Homer,"okay, all right! time's up!"
40847,Homer,oooh. pizza.
40905,Homer,the greatest fight ever and i missed it.
26817,Homer,"oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. but if a woman did it--"
26734,Homer,"hello there, flan-didly-danders."
31000,Homer,"uh, gimme a second, i'm in the bathroom."
33649,Homer,just see that my fiancée marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
26704,Homer,secrets and lies...
18474,Homer,i 'unno. i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
15265,Homer,uhh... can't you see i'm reading the uh...
14828,Homer,would i!
19926,Homer,"you want some puppies, eh, mr. brockman?"
34632,Homer,"moe, my in-laws are coming. i need something strong enough that i forget i hate them, but not so strong that i tell them i love them."
13980,Homer,why? i just saw the best part.
19543,Homer,"oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too."
27088,Homer,i came up with a stage move i feel is very cool.
39004,Homer,seems almost a shame i'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.
22270,Homer,"so, who won? the losers?"
26353,Homer,"honey, did you get any sleep?"
27549,Homer,now he's got it.
33786,Homer,"marge, the boy and i will be making westminster abbey."
16458,Homer,marge lives here?
39178,Homer,how do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
19539,Homer,thanks! i'd love an omelet right about now.
17391,Homer,for a minute there i thought i was in big trouble. it's just a...
26398,Homer,wee! wee! wee! wee!
26533,Homer,"our next story is ""hamlet,"" by william shakespeare."
35188,Homer,it better be tonsillitis.
29658,Homer,dios mio!
37666,Homer,i'm thinking about it!
15022,Homer,"well, the picasso... my collection of classic cars..."
26896,Homer,a blackout?! every time santa and i get together it's a disaster.
36742,Homer,i don't want to see it!
37334,Homer,"once again, by eating alone i have saved my marriage."
18280,Homer,"oh, lisa, i was looking for you. i wanted to apologize. i don't know exactly what went wrong, but i know it's always my fault."
35322,Homer,my ear makes money?
34119,Homer,"oh, i love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
24436,Homer,fine. there are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
23765,Homer,"please, mr. coleman. we can explain."
24179,Homer,"well, ak, it's because god is powerful, but also insecure, like barbra streisand, before james brolin. oh, he's been a rock."
24452,Homer,"less yappin', more zappin'."
29654,Homer,"yeah, he's all ""cowabunga, dude!"" what's that mean? nothing, i bet."
21516,Homer,not for you it isn't. you're in the grease business now.
36765,Homer,virtual stapler!
22950,Homer,"oh, arthur fortune!"
30012,Homer,"i wrote it about shelbyville, then changed the names."
40280,Homer,"wait a minute, capital city has a mascot. the greatest mascot there is: the capital city ""goofball""."
26810,Homer,that is called parenting. i'm going to moe's.
18478,Homer,"oh, come on, mom. we use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
31573,Homer,"you did the right thing, boy."
14726,Homer,stop it.
41133,Homer,yes!!!
24631,Homer,damnit!
35263,Homer,tickle tickle too!
25989,Homer,teenage vandals smashing the bar! moe's gonna kill me.
34099,Homer,there comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. do we eat dessert or do we make love?
17774,Homer,"i know kids, i'm scared too."
21800,Homer,"apu, i'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and i don't want any guff. first of all, i'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --"
24284,Homer,"all i know is, i'm finally getting the support i need."
26632,Homer,i didn't. but now daddy's special medicine...
26747,Homer,"i need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till i tap the keg."
14408,Homer,it's a date! so... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread?
36651,Homer,"a poker site is now safer than an american bank. has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
18419,Homer,"one for ""honk,"" please."
39711,Homer,"oh! he didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?"
20112,Homer,"come off! come off! oh, all right, you!"
37669,Homer,you cost me a piece of all of that!
22594,Homer,okay.
20176,Homer,"lisa, knock off that racket!"
40741,Homer,i'm homer.
19426,Homer,but i need it!
26777,Homer,i think he's building to something.
31045,Homer,i'm your husband!
16225,Homer,kill my boss? do i dare live out the american dream?
30429,Homer,replace is such an ugly word. we upgraded.
21647,Homer,"oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like thomas edison, jr. you know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. oh, and later, he raised turkeys. that was on his turkey farm."
32240,Homer,singing opera made me good at painting.
23694,Homer,"oh, no. you're not gettin' me on that dance floor. don't try and make me. if i have to get a divorce i will."
36576,Homer,i like it when you don't say words.
29038,Homer,"not so fast, old-time liberal."
31137,Homer,season tickets?! i could entertain business clients. i might even land the henderson account!
31278,Homer,avenge me!
17107,Homer,it's great to be indoors with my family.
41292,Homer,i really wish i had fixed that faucet.
15654,Homer,that's right. and who might you be?
37330,Homer,okay... this should do it.
23858,Homer,"oh, this is gonna be so great."
18204,Homer,"no! i've gotta pass this class for my kids. son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
28830,Homer,"man, even i think movie popcorn has gotten too big."
13687,Homer,"uh, well actually, moe..."
14114,Homer,homer simpson here.
37277,Homer,don't wanna hit you. i want your wife.
37719,Homer,"um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided rocky's voice, june foray. a true legend in the voiceover community. i'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence."
13584,Homer,are you sure you're here voluntarily?
28314,Homer,thank you.
29835,Homer,"she'll realize she was a fool, when..."
25884,Homer,cobras! cobras!
15938,Homer,he'll tell us what to do.
23782,Homer,"hmmm... ""the widowmaker,"" oh, that one's for the ladies. ""spinebuster,"" boring. ooh, ""colostomizer."""
41006,Homer,and i want to let you!!
14064,Homer,it passed the first test: i didn't go blind.
26640,Homer,wow. wow. god does so much for me. and he doesn't ask anything in return.
40104,Homer,ahhhh!
27112,Homer,woo hoo!
14374,Homer,what? didn't you hear what he said?
21965,Homer,"good news, my delicious friend! you're going to be a free-range lobster."
20585,Homer,open a window.
38754,Homer,yep. it's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. pretty unforeseen...
30719,Homer,"hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. it's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
26039,Homer,got that cat right in the leg.
13241,Homer,"""levi's."" hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
28319,Homer,that was over soccer results! can you believe they gave giggs a yellow card in the box?
16184,Homer,"aw thanks, marge. but it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul."
34653,Homer,you're not leaving me?
23711,Homer,"i'm the president and the decision is mine. we're hell's satans. besides, i've already made our club jackets."
19360,Homer,tele-panhandling.
23102,Homer,my children deserve to see me get a free gift.
13622,Homer,"look, marge, that guy has the same last name we do... taxi!"
36164,Homer,"don't yell at me, brain! this happened on your watch! you have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!"
23026,Homer,the internet? is that thing still around?
26410,Homer,rainier wolfcastle.
37030,Homer,it's not that kind!
41224,Homer,donald trump? no. arnold palmer? no. bill cosby? no.
32548,Homer,your memory bubble and you.
16081,Homer,then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
22271,Homer,losers.
31982,Homer,i'm so sick of being lost. to hell with maze etiquette! i'm walking straight outta here!
34702,Homer,marge! you ruined my shot!
27531,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll make it up to them. by throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
29479,Homer,hey moe... haven't seen you in a while.
30083,Homer,well... i guess this thing does look pretty silly. let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch tv.
20945,Homer,"let me out! i'm innocent! i changed my mind, i don't want to be in here anymore!"
22990,Homer,hm...
20228,Homer,a musical instrument? could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? just give me a sign!
39251,Homer,why you little eggheaded...!
41080,Homer,i'm saying...
14297,Homer,hm... bart's birthday's coming up.
25777,Homer,no! no! no one is taking my kids from me!
24441,Homer,too late.
35189,Homer,"so, i guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
34023,Homer,or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
32245,Homer,a little bit louder now!
20505,Homer,you're already in a home.
35299,Homer,what the?!
34822,Homer,you can't tell what's inside! of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
34805,Homer,"boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is."
28464,Homer,"well, i took bart's advice last week, so i guess it's lisa's turn. now, if you'll excuse me..."
36797,Homer,"well, this is how god would send me a message. in my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. what do you think he's trying to tell me, flanders?"
25985,Homer,i don't get it.
31677,Homer,"son, one day you're going to be a great father."
29613,Homer,opposite? yuck!!
24976,Homer,would you?
30379,Homer,...fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
37552,Homer,"you just dodged a bullet, mister sugarpants."
24558,Homer,well i'll be damned.
19102,Homer,yes.
32390,Homer,beehive!
37584,Homer,how y'all doin'?
29541,Homer,"wow. at last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. you suckers, i would have done it for free!"
15586,Homer,"this is all your fault! oh, how can i stay mad at you?"
32903,Homer,that bad. wow.
25344,Homer,which one am i? serena or venus?
32322,Homer,american sober or irish sober?
22335,Homer,"yes! now that lenny's in, carl will fall like a domino."
37767,Homer,where's hoju? where's hojuuu?!
19562,Homer,this interview is over!
18330,Homer,"oh, there's so much i don't know about astrophysics. i wish i'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
16708,Homer,"ah, come on, marge, you're way too..."
13285,Homer,beer... for me?
18327,Homer,ow!
38343,Homer,whew!
34543,Homer,"oh. well i'm not crawling back to big electricity! from now on, the simpsons are living intermittently."
28521,Homer,"children, children, what day is this?"
35357,Homer,you are such a gentle kisser.
34558,Homer,"that whale's not gonna die! we're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, escobar! god, this thing writes itself."
38197,Homer,oh... crap.
14284,Homer,"ahh, bart. daddy's little angel."
17189,Homer,but they're so sweet.
30148,Homer,i've had enough -- i'm leaving!
22333,Homer,c'mon!
26172,Homer,the tv!
40676,Homer,"my old man. well, i gotta go."
39296,Homer,go! go!
16967,Homer,"well, i'm off to work."
14082,Homer,get away from me.
33838,Homer,that was great. you mind if i use that at work?
22867,Homer,he must be a hundred feet tall.
20419,Homer,you're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
40032,Homer,"and if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
15097,Homer,come here you.
39715,Homer,i hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
37610,Homer,they taught me something i found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. this t-shirt lied to me!
35504,Homer,"hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. better put in some overtime."
15835,Homer,no. let me hear you play.
38591,Homer,"oh, i love canadian on canadian violence. oh baby, this is so great! thank you so much!"
16401,Homer,"this ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, flanders. this is the real thing..."
37057,Homer,"help me, god! what is it i'm paying you for every sunday?"
25365,Homer,and my dream is to get rid of bart.
36298,Homer,hey!
16354,Homer,that's what i've been saying. we're all fine the way we are.
27673,Homer,bo-ring!
14589,Homer,maaarge... the dog doesn't count as a kid.
38665,Homer,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? you bet i'd like one..."""
28689,Homer,the harpooned heart. book on tape! as read by mary-kate and ashley olsen.
40581,Homer,"hey, hey, guys. knock it off. it's just my wife."
13359,Homer,about last night... you might have noticed daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
28056,Homer,my feet are inside me.
31922,Homer,"nappien, you did it again! and everything is as it should be."
35754,Homer,somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
19000,Homer,"hi, everybody. is everybody... good?"
21283,Homer,"yeah, it's somethin', all right."
41362,Homer,"she is flirting with me. okay, homer, let her down easy. don't go breaking any hearts."
27580,Homer,"of course, because you wouldn't want to... i paid for your splendor, you...!"
27938,Homer,uh-oh! we forgot to empty the mini-bar!
19602,Homer,so burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
23854,Homer,make me.
22995,Homer,"hello, i have a certificate for a free erotic photo session."
29338,Homer,you uh...
28777,Homer,"marge, i've always loved you. bart, you were a worthy foe."
14198,Homer,"wow, what an ending? who'd have thought darth vader was luke skywalker's father."
33886,Homer,wouldn't it be easier if i just took acting lessons?
30136,Homer,ah... this is heaven.
17360,Homer,"well, you can't possibly like maggie best. what has she ever done? nothin' for nobody!"
40378,Homer,"ah, ""may the best man win"". the mating call of the loser."
21017,Homer,"well, guys, i won't be seeing you for a while."
30292,Homer,"she, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner."
26820,Homer,"i was trying to throw bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree."
22780,Homer,"oh, there, there, i'm sure he's gone to a better place, lord."
29490,Homer,he's only your emotional uncle! i'm your real uncle!
31680,Homer,"stop it, winston!"
21859,Homer,"i believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. if celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively."
30419,Homer,we'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
33746,Homer,"well, i know when i'm not wanted. am i wanted?"
28356,Homer,only my hairdresser knows for sure.
13655,Homer,that was a joke?
40096,Homer,what?
32778,Homer,"okay, bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. step one: we chuck the raccoon in there."
31563,Homer,"ew, it tastes terrible!"
40570,Homer,"oh, the truth!"
13191,Homer,screw you!
20913,Homer,"oh, you did. but -- i still don't know... i can just imagine what marge would say."
31897,Homer,"wrong, wrong, wrong!"
34865,Homer,"don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
36123,Homer,this isn't comfortable at all! i don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
32615,Homer,i can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!
16739,Homer,"i'll field this one. the only danger is if they send us to that terrible planet of the apes. ...wait a minute, statue of liberty... that was our planet. you maniacs! you blew it up! damn you! damn you all to hell."
34043,Homer,"all right, i put in a hundred-hour work week, but i took a power-nap while i was driving us here and now i'm rarin' to go!"
24068,Homer,"okay, be right down."
17632,Homer,no.
25717,Homer,jet-son!
13158,Homer,i got it!
29801,Homer,well... i don't know.
39873,Homer,you mean all white with pink eyes?
18247,Homer,sure.
27229,Homer,where's that kid with my latte?!
36885,Homer,oh no! i won't be able to help you pack up grampa!
37920,Homer,"i can't go back to jail! there's no shampoo, just soap!"
27851,Homer,"no, no. this is nothing like milhouse's parents. now if you need me i'll be staying with milhouse's father."
39460,Homer,no. we're going to say grace first.
34726,Homer,"sure, sure!"
39462,Homer,no! i'm not done yet.
19195,Homer,"gee, thanks, moe... what's this?"
41404,Homer,now remember -- steer into the sculptures.
26438,Homer,because i want to be your hero. on top of which i don't look bald.
37493,Homer,you can't not do it!
30237,Homer,because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
26060,Homer,"c'mon, he's a total player."
33268,Homer,we'll look it up in the corona.
18168,Homer,which one were you? the ugly one?
34454,Homer,you don't think i'm going to?
32630,Homer,what? not allowed to get one right?
19301,Homer,"oh, we can't afford that. who do you think i am, liz taylor?"
32429,Homer,"oh yeah, marge, i love these business trips of yours. the tv remote isn't nailed on. my whole life, i've never been in a hotel that trusted me."
27913,Homer,everybody hates that stupid jerk!
19599,Homer,"i think i won, mr. burns."
27976,Homer,fine.
28535,Homer,just like the pope!
24861,Homer,"yep, you can't go wrong with mr. x."
15576,Homer,sand... wich...
28582,Homer,i'm confused! which is it?
18356,Homer,"no. it would only worry her. if you want to add to her worries, go ahead. i guess i'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
40714,Homer,what are you talking about?
29543,Homer,dammit! will you take a check?
29414,Homer,"i'll get a second job. one that pays well. you think those guys on ""friends"" need another friend?"
15551,Homer,batman's a scientist.
22954,Homer,"wait a minute... because i brought the check, they named a wing after me? oh, you must be mad."
28228,Homer,"you sure know me, mom."
31895,Homer,on one condition: you do the shlepping.
15659,Homer,yeah?
29933,Homer,it's ray! i see him again! monster! you don't exist.
30310,Homer,why don't you pick on someone your own size?
24446,Homer,why you little...
38722,Homer,beware the butterfly's sting! what the?
38819,Homer,"what if i left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?"
39374,Homer,"you're right! i'm young, i'm able-bodied, and i'll take anything. watch out, springfield, here i come."
28680,Homer,no! they were all in their own way totally awesome.
33832,Homer,thank you.
26937,Homer,"have no fear, springshield's present!"
23324,Homer,really? like what?
40787,Homer,hel - lo.
13443,Homer,my beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
33267,Homer,praise be oliver.
19120,Homer,"could you, um... work any harder than this?"
39902,Homer,"okay, okay. i love bart. well..."
39198,Homer,on a beautiful night like tonight... how could i not?
38670,Homer,we're here.
41359,Homer,"okay, just imagine she's a bond girl."
25309,Homer,my manhood? i never thought of that!
26227,Homer,to amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
26573,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge."
25750,Homer,peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo!
18826,Homer,all right... wait a minute. for what?
40642,Homer,"till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth."
25245,Homer,"whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
36090,Homer,"you know sweetie, there was a time when i would've killed for that information, but i'm pleased to announce i've already bought your mother a present."
34033,Homer,"not an option, big fella. either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!"
15705,Homer,why not?
14643,Homer,uh...the last one.
17609,Homer,"yep, but they gave me these rollerblades so i can glide to the front door."
38668,Homer,start with flanders... start with flanders...
17589,Homer,what do they do? what don't they do! oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! my stars.
31443,Homer,oh my god! it's the opportunity of a lifetime!
28242,Homer,"hey guys, i brought my mom."
29995,Homer,fine. i'd rather die.
17747,Homer,"oh, there are pictures. i keep them where i need the most cheering up."
36656,Homer,sorry. check out my new t-shirt.
33381,Homer,"dondelinger! i should have been class president, but you stole the election from me."
24812,Homer,"huh? oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?"
16324,Homer,"if this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
28424,Homer,"wrong again, liberal media."
18738,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye! what's for breakfast?"
39540,Homer,"lisa! lisa, are you still in there? what's the problem? did you fall in? lisa!"
32344,Homer,why does he always bring up my weight?
26933,Homer,who said you did?
26994,Homer,"yeah, it's a good group."
14316,Homer,"hey, what's up?"
15435,Homer,more.
31967,Homer,"moe, i think we may have perverted..."
19908,Homer,it was in... it was in my pocket.
26601,Homer,what?!
26580,Homer,"ooh, they look like skittles."
39706,Homer,"oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
28820,Homer,plead the fifth amend-what?
39054,Homer,boy. sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.
15926,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna miss you so much. and it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. but mostly, i'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
29079,Homer,my beer! you never had a chance to become my urine! why you little...
19141,Homer,any sugar around here?
17079,Homer,"okay, marge, things were said, mistakes were made. let's end this madness and get on with our lives."
35898,Homer,woo hoo! i'm famous again!
24340,Homer,gimme that!
30236,Homer,he's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
27615,Homer,three ribwiches please. and instead of a shake i'd like a blended ribwich.
28894,Homer,"hey, i only drink that when i'm already drunk."
22987,Homer,no. but i got it.
39574,Homer,"oh, so that's it. this is some kind of underwear thing."
22396,Homer,"hey, what's going on? that guy's not homer simpson. he's fat and stupid."
36431,Homer,"when i was in special ops, they held me in an afghan prison where all i could see was a patch of blue sky. but that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes."
28480,Homer,"oh carl, you remembered i like tv!"
16485,Homer,oh yeah.
35170,Homer,"that's great, honey. if you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
22505,Homer,i used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
28089,Homer,i am homer tribal chief / i am wearing tiny briefs / braves teach value boys should know / now extended drum so-lo
18481,Homer,seven!
41163,Homer,"i can't move, boy."
35296,Homer,i'll teach you to...
20664,Homer,"yes, kent. ""hello, jerk. we may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. but one thing's for sure: you do exist."""
18370,Homer,"so that's it, isn't it, marge? looks. i didn't know you were so shallow."
32926,Homer,"hm, what could i make from those two things?"
16293,Homer,"it's marge! she's become a crazed criminal, just because i didn't take her to the ballet."
37272,Homer,even after we came to school?
28716,Homer,i don't wanna go home! i'm not done talking to me!
37306,Homer,"marge, wait!"
29007,Homer,this rolling is just temporary.
27142,Homer,"stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. nice going, geniuses."
35377,Homer,wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
18806,Homer,"you can't let yourself end up in a place like this. you've got two choices: you can give up on yourself and take the barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
13478,Homer,an elephant's butt.
34203,Homer,i'm gonna make it! i'm gonna make it!
33676,Homer,"aw, her first enabling."
27227,Homer,"marge, i'm still not sure about this."
13146,Homer,that's 'cause i've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
17535,Homer,"you heard your mother's ramblings. she's fine, so behave."
33211,Homer,have i made the bet yet?
20362,Homer,"all right, put your... oh well, i'll rob it next time."
21771,Homer,"ooh, look at it go."
20997,Homer,"uh, maybe."
27714,Homer,god yes!
30261,Homer,who's gonna watch the kids?
17580,Homer,"stonecutters, eh? how do i join?"
29187,Homer,"well, that loser milhouse has always had a thing for her. don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
34680,Homer,"you never fail to nauseate me, boy."
39941,Homer,earth to marge. earth to marge. i was there... the clown's g-i-l-l -t-y.
40439,Homer,"well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister."
14887,Homer,check... mate.
21728,Homer,ooh. how are bart and lisa gonna get out of this one?
37894,Homer,illegally download it? is that legal?
24725,Homer,"sorry you're such jerks! ha, ha!"
19410,Homer,"hey, marge, you don't smoke!"
23663,Homer,my mistake. stay in the moment.
36177,Homer,okay... place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
16067,Homer,"no, ma'am."
35147,Homer,more for me.
23658,Homer,really? on top and underneath?
28691,Homer,i didn't lie. i was writing fiction with my mouth.
22404,Homer,"well, i'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about..."
22429,Homer,"yeah, but faster."
20277,Homer,"hmmm, two bucks... and it only transports matter? umm... well, ah... i'll give you 35 cents."
41000,Homer,are you sure you want to give me a car?
29436,Homer,there are other ways to get into canada...
29321,Homer,i believe it was the school's tuba.
29190,Homer,i can still hear her. i'd better do something.
22227,Homer,eeech.
31442,Homer,"what the hell do you kids want? oh right, ice cream."
38387,Homer,"let them play! we won't look, we'll turn away / go make love, then eat some hay..."
16059,Homer,... it was the most i ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
14518,Homer,"what do ya think, lisa?"
26604,Homer,"aw, look. i've made some friends. and now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!"
21074,Homer,i guess that's it. ladies and gentlemen... we're in a tough spot and i don't know if we're gonna get out. please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
23220,Homer,"well, i have been thinking about making them into cut-offs..."
27121,Homer,i'm ready. just give me a guitar. how many solos should i do? four?
14824,Homer,boring.
26684,Homer,"but there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away."
39776,Homer,"oh, sorry... ouch!"
40301,Homer,bart was strangely quiet. later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. that wouldn't last.
28337,Homer,wait! we have to exchange insurance!
18482,Homer,"rhetorical, eh? eight."
25493,Homer,"now don't feel bad, honey. did you know back in grade school, i had a bully problem myself?"
20612,Homer,"yeah, honey. even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother."
18999,Homer,"you know, marge, in some ways you and i are very different people..."
38595,Homer,"and if you trust them, i trust them too."
37001,Homer,this is my daughter. she brings the gift of music to the new world.
26315,Homer,i was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
15378,Homer,"dad, i have a problem."
30647,Homer,"i am the gayest super-villain ever! beware my scented candles! oooooo, scented!"
37572,Homer,"i overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
18978,Homer,"i went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music i'd never heard of. it was like the store had gone crazy."
18590,Homer,but... but...
35202,Homer,then what did i just smoke?
31472,Homer,recording that fake fight was a great idea.
18829,Homer,okay.
29951,Homer,"now if i wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?"
34010,Homer,"ooo, mouth."
34142,Homer,i'll kill you! you son-of-a--- don't look hurt. it's okay. it's okay. it's okay.
37518,Homer,"just call me borders books, 'cause i'll always be here."
35723,Homer,i know five idiots!
40683,Homer,"get moving, you hunk of junk. i gotta make up for lost time."
22610,Homer,fonzie's jacket!
31715,Homer,"i'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
15463,Homer,"i made an ""h""."
24196,Homer,is everybody happyyyyy?
36126,Homer,"don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! geez, it's all over the place. holy moly."
19688,Homer,"around the house, i never lift a finger / as a husband and father i'm sub-par / i'd rather drink a beer than win father of the year / i'm happy with things the way they are."
16167,Homer,"a million dollars and three hawaiian islands. good ones, not the leper ones."
17906,Homer,sorry marge.
14357,Homer,"ugh, this is ridiculous. what am i supposed to do? lisa, who do you think's gonna win? the bengals or the dolphins?"
16222,Homer,ahhh.
15472,Homer,"no, but the rabbi gave me this."
36876,Homer,i brought these people to springfield... and now they've taken over!
32688,Homer,c'mon. c'mon. oh c'mon.
16769,Homer,"yeah, maybe i do have the right... what's that stuff? anyway, thanks, marge, lisa."
18237,Homer,that's the plan.
39080,Homer,who are you?
32482,Homer,all i want is a battery.
37762,Homer,"aw, that's sweet."
38237,Homer,where's your mother?
32790,Homer,i was having the most wonderful dream. i always wake up just before the good part.
36039,Homer,and i can drive drunk while i'm actually sober!
21035,Homer,"you know marge, joining the reserves was the best thing i ever did. i feel good about myself, i'm helping my country, and later, i'm gonna get gilligan's autograph."
27548,Homer,that's okay. his cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.
33951,Homer,"okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. show me some of bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
39395,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"
39781,Homer,starving.
36705,Homer,a perfect storm?
17103,Homer,"wait a minute! wait, that's it! i know now what i can offer you that no one else can. complete and utter dependence."
20591,Homer,i don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
36965,Homer,america can't collapse! we're as powerful as ancient rome!
25035,Homer,"yes, exactly!"
33820,Homer,"i need to rent an apartment in the worst part of waverly hills -- the crappier, the better."
29638,Homer,next!
24803,Homer,yes. i humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
37707,Homer,woo-hoo! i'm an attractive concept like liberty!
31894,Homer,pay to the order of... stupid reverend... memo: bite my ass ... wha?!
23706,Homer,"yeah, that's the life for me, marge. cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers."
26596,Homer,so that means i don't have to pay the fare.
37303,Homer,"conversation, conversation... you look great."
38307,Homer,"all right, i'll have the lasagna."
41549,Homer,"i can't do it! our harmony-laden r&b doesn't make sense in this cruel world. i'm taking our music to the next level: guitar rock utilizing nihilist grunge energies. or, as i call it: grunge."
36600,Homer,"what about... you know... ""stinky""?"
20813,Homer,what? what did i say?
34086,Homer,hmm... hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
36316,Homer,ahhh. doesn't get any better than this.
14251,Homer,"i don't know, i don't know --"
13325,Homer,mmm... hors doovers.
16889,Homer,"grooming him, eh?"
22574,Homer,oh no. i'm out of popcorn.
34352,Homer,sorry!
24811,Homer,"i mean, screw you!"
20321,Homer,"i couldn't agree more, marjorie. you deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."
24972,Homer,i think you know the answer to that.
19894,Homer,"i'll bet you really hate rex banner, huh?"
23735,Homer,"now don't worry. i am gonna search high and low for your mother. but just in case i don't find her, i want you to contact this agency."
33814,Homer,it was stuffed with cash!
39824,Homer,oh no.
18006,Homer,i found them on the night stand this morning. i guess they weren't his cup of tea. don't worry about it.
34705,Homer,"oooh, the nobies!"
20525,Homer,"moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?"
35005,Homer,i'd give anything to bring you back.
33395,Homer,"hey, debbie, um... wanna go to prom with me?"
39608,Homer,"hey, how much is it?"
35412,Homer,"marge, do you hear it? listen! it's the hair -- growing! always growing! blonde, brunette... auburn!"
38881,Homer,what the? pfft. gibberish! pure gibberish!
31127,Homer,"tickets, thirty dollars! big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
25806,Homer,it--
41310,Homer,"yes, sir."
29461,Homer,"okay honey, i'll do it."
27493,Homer,"ugh, where's the remote?"
32373,Homer,"now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
15918,Homer,i'll miss sheriff lobo...
22496,Homer,"oh, she's not gonna leave you right before valentine's day. that'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash."
34927,Homer,now we just have to make it.
20980,Homer,what about you?
38927,Homer,what kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
16847,Homer,neddie? neddddieee!
15782,Homer,"yeah, you're right. guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
41058,Homer,assassins!
29452,Homer,smoked salmon... shrimp... crab legs!
22669,Homer,i told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. bom-bom-bom-bom... i told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
14751,Homer,"look maggie, they have a baby, too."
29053,Homer,since when do i listen to cakes?
29334,Homer,"i just hate to see you upset, honey. you know what would be a good name for maggie? chloe."
26181,Homer,you got that right.
40705,Homer,"oh, gimme a break, marge."
36412,Homer,"yeah, dr. cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
16124,Homer,mora wuza?
27894,Homer,you have that on tape?!
33152,Homer,forever? that would be awesome.
21305,Homer,"look, son. daddy got in shape. e--"
33406,Homer,"how you doin', dad?"
20448,Homer,"ah, you guys are some k..."
25117,Homer,there's a crayon in my brain?!
33570,Homer,maybe it's beef stew!
34694,Homer,and i also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
27897,Homer,that is the best kiss i've had tonight.
28771,Homer,"why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? why, santa, why?"
32140,Homer,"um... um...c'mon, say ""you're hired""!"
22259,Homer,"well, i only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you."
15774,Homer,hired goons?
28638,Homer,hmm... need more lap.
29349,Homer,"oh yes you are. why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
15359,Homer,when the working day is done / girls just wanna have fu-un / that's all we really wannnnt...
29266,Homer,"marge, i don't want to freak you out, but i think i love you."
14394,Homer,not quite. they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers.
24445,Homer,i... 8... p.p.
15468,Homer,"oh yeah, that's the stuff."
17058,Homer,i went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. i really think i was born to teach.
21397,Homer,these are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
21091,Homer,"what is it, sweetie? did you see a scary picture in your picture book?"
33772,Homer,"sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the continental congress. dolphins swim in cliques. those are my two examples."
15850,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
20521,Homer,lied to his mother.
23096,Homer,"well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
37716,Homer,"so that's it? all my dreams, lived?"
16687,Homer,"i'm coming with you. i got you fired, it's the least i can do... well, the least i can do is absolutely nothing. but i'll go you one better and come along."
33198,Homer,"well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. now if you'll excuse me..."
34689,Homer,"well, since moe's is closed again, i thought i'd help you cook dinner."
19401,Homer,"what about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
32809,Homer,well... it might be cold outside.
37130,Homer,"finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
20958,Homer,"hey, hey look, a freezer man!"
27742,Homer,"i have a plan to get to the top, but i have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. i'm not sure i could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
13142,Homer,so cool.
25785,Homer,"yeah, that'll happen."
17731,Homer,"don't worry, joey. we'll make it to california some day."
24921,Homer,that's impossible. all my stories are bull plop. bull plop!
16718,Homer,how about me?
16112,Homer,absolutely. now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
25808,Homer,"and it's important to feel good about yourself... okay, spread your toes. do you know how much glass is in here?"
16052,Homer,"maybe you're right. i did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
13653,Homer,"hey, no tagbacks."
16288,Homer,the old make-out place. hey! a new weather station. i'll bash it good!
28532,Homer,"all right, now you're startin' to creep me out."
26179,Homer,why you little...

13288,Homer,me good dad.
41207,Homer,"ah, good evening, zohar the adulterer. my wife sends her warmest regards."
17702,Homer,"i was in heaven. if horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
14058,Homer,"hey, i know a good drink. really hits the spot. i invented it myself..."
35827,Homer,it's closing?! but where will people find clips of old tv shows if they're not housed in a giant building? where? where?
32934,Homer,"you monster! on another subject, next thursday i have to leave work early. i assume that's cool."

14613,Homer,"uh... later. first, i want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... doggie heaven."
39754,Homer,"you always say we should talk. i'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. but i'm going to stop in a second. so, please say something back, marge, please. i'm gonna stop talking... now."
17564,Homer,lousy traffic jams. the traffic report'll get me outta this one.
27431,Homer,"hey, your early porno movies! are any of these hetero?"
15566,Homer,"all right, i'm almost there."
32966,Homer,i'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
23280,Homer,how about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
27445,Homer,"it's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
20384,Homer,i didn't get one yet.
30730,Homer,"boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
18119,Homer,"marge, how did you know..."
29568,Homer,why must i be so voluptuous?
35035,Homer,"hey, marge. partaking of the grape, were we?"
22314,Homer,"now this wheel balancing is free, right?"
14755,Homer,lousy snitch.
37199,Homer,"there's other p.o.s? uh-oh, better put on my game shades."
25612,Homer,homer wants a brownie! i'm gonna get one!
39343,Homer,"wow! what are you readin' there? comic books? uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?"

32306,Homer,"okay, we've got time for one more."
18079,Homer,nothing. i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
37964,Homer,now that's disgusting. wine made of rice?
18584,Homer,"lemme set the scene for you, marge."
32970,Homer,what a great job. and i could use a job right now.
22555,Homer,shut up! screw you guys!
38140,Homer,i don't know. how 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
31020,Homer,"well, uh... uh... honey, you're just as smart as a man. sometimes when i'm with you, i feel like i'm doing it with a dude."
18445,Homer,"right away, mr. smithers! i'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"
35210,Homer,"dave's not here, man!"
23238,Homer,maarge. i think bart's gone crazy!
36250,Homer,"hey, i've gotta tell ya, i'm miserable there. i'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"
26598,Homer,"fine. take me, but let the boy go."
29553,Homer,"yeah... you help me, and i, in turn, am helped by you."
23493,Homer,oh... where are you?
29366,Homer,"i'm pathetic? because i take money from my ten-year-old son? well, let me tell you something: i still call the shots around here!"
26509,Homer,"if i'm laughing at what i think i am, it's very funny. anyway... ""as night fell, the greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
35275,Homer,i'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
36406,Homer,"well, why can't i hang out at the bar all day? my wife doesn't wanna be with me."
32314,Homer,"oh, wait. that's lisa's nose."
29682,Homer,"you name it, oh wise mountain ape."
25274,Homer,"come on, marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: john rocker, o.j. simpson, dorf..."
30854,Homer,i am so stoked about lenny's party. he said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
20621,Homer,"this is my car! and i'm not fat, it's glandular!"
40782,Homer,and anyone can be tooted?
35042,Homer,can we at least drink beer or something?
18747,Homer,"i've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. so here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
14381,Homer,"oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
30072,Homer,...minus the number of filipinos in the bible...and you get...
34640,Homer,"go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!"
40342,Homer,i'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. i got a little excited. i'm not perfect... like ned flanders.
15792,Homer,"haw, haw. april fool's! i've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! sucker!"
35168,Homer,well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? don't take any of my ideas.
29062,Homer,i can't sleep. i keep thinking about the pie man.
21112,Homer,but not fat.
23808,Homer,"oh, but lenny just got some bottle rockets."
20316,Homer,"what did i tell you, marge?"
27415,Homer,we'll just tell the police and then i'm back to being plain old rock strongo.
32713,Homer,three please!
26048,Homer,"well, i knew that before i came in here. a guy outside told me that."
39666,Homer,get 'em off me! get 'em off! aaah!
31825,Homer,why don't i just put on a dress?!
15322,Homer,call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is mr. plow.
29978,Homer,neunundneunzig luftballons / auf ihrem weg zum horizont / hielt man fuer ufos aus dem all / darum schickte ein general /
31466,Homer,"oh my god. she's gonna jump. marge, don't do it! give divorce a chance!"
25976,Homer,"oh, i don't know. what would moe say about that?"
20103,Homer,i can't feel my legs!
23841,Homer,"this place is a blast. all we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing."
14090,Homer,"you just lost yourself a customer, moe!"
29908,Homer,oh thank god. where is he? tell me!
13406,Homer,i am the champions / i am the champions / no time for losers / cause i am the champions / of the worlllld!
14985,Homer,god?
40951,Homer,a half-brother?
38405,Homer,dinner party at the neighbors'. at least i can drink.
21471,Homer,did that butter churn just move? 'cause if it did...
26535,Homer,it's cold outside. you'll need a sweater. a sweater!
35877,Homer,woo hoo! can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where i carry my stress.
27750,Homer,"no, it's entirely within my power. furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. check and mate. now, king me!"
41483,Homer,wheeee -- i'm sort of rich! i can rent anything i want!
25729,Homer,"no, that's not how ya do it."
27607,Homer,you seem like an impartial observer. but i've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
15277,Homer,moe! don't throw out that brine!
21203,Homer,"no room for you, jell-o."
19017,Homer,"die? well, you don't scare me, doc. 'cause dying would be a stone groove. got any messages for jimi hendrix?"
27805,Homer,"don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?"
23292,Homer,let me see.
16178,Homer,after lunch can i whip you?
34521,Homer,"now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa."
20292,Homer,"nice work, son."
24241,Homer,i am an angel from the future.
22976,Homer,"come on, nessie. one more pull."
19165,Homer,"no, i'm not!"
36596,Homer,"marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"
17696,Homer,"marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. i've got to wash my hair."
34561,Homer,hm. we need a better idea. we'll have to find the town's smartest men.
39320,Homer,"what have you done this time, boy?"
27909,Homer,his name is ned!
31140,Homer,that's just how i feel.
19347,Homer,"yes, we do. i got us a divorce this afternoon."
15376,Homer,wow. how much? how much?
16737,Homer,"no. it wasn't me, i swear. it was... him."
19991,Homer,konichi-wa.
13462,Homer,"hey, let's go! emergency! life-or-death here!"
40223,Homer,what's wrong? i just want to snuggle.
32717,Homer,"hey marge, looking for something? i'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper i don't like. maybe it'll be this one."
37010,Homer,"don't be silly, ""mary ellen."""
29500,Homer,"moe, you've won. i'll see you at baggage claim."
39841,Homer,forget that. i'm teaching my boy a lesson. is she here or not?
29322,Homer,"chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything i've ever had at this table."
39686,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
30690,Homer,i'm sorry... i got a little carried away there.
33851,Homer,woo-hoo!
40557,Homer,"yes, son."
35663,Homer,woo-hoo!
27504,Homer,"dear lord, as i think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, i am reminded of colonel sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? i command you!"
40980,Homer,just a little further. just a little further. just a little further. just a little further.
37614,Homer,see?
32337,Homer,"oh marge, i was afraid i was going to lose you! ohhh! now let me help you make your slow transition back to society."
22115,Homer,"bart, no!"
31352,Homer,"fingers, fingers, fingers!"
16914,Homer,here's the keys.
14735,Homer,"later, marge. lurleen's on tv tonight. i gotta get ready."
31302,Homer,marge! i missed you! all this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
17452,Homer,"no, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. i imagine i'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
18621,Homer,"hey! what's wrong with this neighborhood? big shot. too good to buy a house here, snobby?"
17227,Homer,i'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
16860,Homer,"push her down, son."
39735,Homer,my birthday?
17497,Homer,this is gonna to be great.
20660,Homer,shut up! one at a time! lisa?
32509,Homer,i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him...
24376,Homer,why isn't my baby gaining weight?
40513,Homer,"because you said so, why?"
26748,Homer,thanks. are you sure you don't want to come? in a civil war reenactment we need lots of indians to shoot.
28129,Homer,"look, maggie's in the paper with moe. how cute."
14954,Homer,i wear short shorts!
17769,Homer,"uh, yeah. i can do that."
21955,Homer,"i tell ya, i'm a financial genius. i buy an eight-dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty-dollar lobster, and eat the profits."
15015,Homer,"boy, everyone is stupid except me."
26561,Homer,i said forget it!
15362,Homer,daddy.
22771,Homer,usually a mink massage makes me feel better. but something's missing now.
18880,Homer,"well, maybe we could order something from oak ridge..."
32288,Homer,"it's homer, idiot."
27070,Homer,damn straight.
35815,Homer,"well i, uh, found that contact lens i was missing. lemme just screw her back in."
37786,Homer,and now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
35580,Homer,this is so horrible -- i can't speak...
33336,Homer,"well, that's bart for ya."
39347,Homer,"don't stifle the boy, marge. we're supposed to encourage him."
25174,Homer,"it was great, all right. but all i wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. because when all is said and done... prison rodeo!?"
33774,Homer,"let's try what chapter seven calls ""un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. hey, lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."
25552,Homer,"i want to shoot a lion in the face, fight muhammad ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras."
21404,Homer,ow! ow! ow! oww!
20989,Homer,"ovulate, damn you! ovulate!"
38710,Homer,cars shaped like cupcakes!
15133,Homer,are you kidding? lisa turned out perfect. i won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing lisa!
36991,Homer,it's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
24093,Homer,"...step up to the best. ned flanders, the man with the chest."
34551,Homer,all right -- let me get my tool belt.
35136,Homer,he didn't know that!
29496,Homer,toilet hole.
22104,Homer,"hmm, still half an hour till dinner. oh, well..."
33030,Homer,"so, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
28654,Homer,maybe on planet zoozoo.
18530,Homer,i'll take care of this.
32224,Homer,"not me, they love me."
31271,Homer,and now to get stinking drunk!
22675,Homer,you better believe i did.
22026,Homer,"it's not an operation, moe. the doctor says it's just a procedure."
39963,Homer,"marge, i uh... love you. marge, honey, i love you. ohhh... marge, i love you, baby. hmm, marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... aah, this'll never work."
32059,Homer,oh.
20570,Homer,look! a message!
15612,Homer,"marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. and to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. permit me to demonstrate."
24978,Homer,"ten-four, kemosabe."
31435,Homer,it's good to see you smile again. i was lonely being happy all by myself.
24154,Homer,great. now my testicle's got ants on it.
17616,Homer,you wanna see how davy crockett really died at the alamo? you must be 18.
34202,Homer,"i'm a-comin', marge!"
40302,Homer,wow.
14176,Homer,na na na na / na na na na /
19659,Homer,you're phony! fakey phony broad!
38731,Homer,i'm not set at all.
22958,Homer,good thing those lesbians knew cpr.
22952,Homer,"well, how 'bout donating money to charity? lots of crazy old coots do that."
41546,Homer,what the hell is going on here? chanting?!
20855,Homer,"welcome to the internet, my friend. how can i help you?"
18099,Homer,i'll be right back. now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
28778,Homer,"oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
24616,Homer,wait a minute! we haven't heard from me yet. the nut with the dynamite. the phone company is bamboozling you!
30080,Homer,uhhh...
40816,Homer,"because i'm sure we were meant to be together. usually when i have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. something says yes, something says no. but this time there's only yes. how could the only thing i've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
37245,Homer,i didn't know you were left-handed.
20524,Homer,all you need is a car bomb and...
25974,Homer,i thought you said you had to go.
34939,Homer,sh!
27343,Homer,"oh, it's so beautiful."
33723,Homer,"it is? 'ey every-ody, 'eck out i 'ompliment!"
28506,Homer,uh... woo hoo! maggie's talking!
15330,Homer,"ring, damn you. ring!"
27298,Homer,don't look at me!
20509,Homer,"jasper. gladys. beatrice. lookin' good, hattie. asa. hazel. hazel! hazel!"
14186,Homer,"actually, bart, i threw up more than your mother. ... it all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
18997,Homer,"i don't think i have a choice, marge."
30145,Homer,makes sense.
30937,Homer,"oh, the cereal's just a metaphor."
14369,Homer,"uh... somewhere in the back. the point is we had a great time today. and to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. okay?"
24124,Homer,"yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."
31122,Homer,now you can only see butts on cable.
17313,Homer,"uh oh, it's seeping in! stupid cheap weather stripping."
28404,Homer,"i know. if i get really scared, i don't want to ruin the suit."
15852,Homer,"marge, i never graduated from high school."
40586,Homer,"alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. start with the feet, still angry? good, good homer, good. this is tough, need refreshment. ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her."
17545,Homer,"good, you do that."
30291,Homer,"oh, just great. things couldn't be better."
21378,Homer,"frankly, i do. i know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. i'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus."
37490,Homer,but how can we learn to read ancient icelandic?
37522,Homer,why are you taking away the train?
37338,Homer,woo hoo! i'll woo her with woo-hoo!
20960,Homer,"now you're swingin', honey!"
40955,Homer,i guess he's got us there.
24507,Homer,i want to set the record straight. i thought the cop was a prostitute.
38898,Homer,oh who am i kidding? i couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. i'm going back to save them.
28658,Homer,i also fed some ducklings.
22164,Homer,hey! how did churchy la femme get half price?
33426,Homer,you're the government's problem now!
41250,Homer,money can be exchanged for goods and services.
21114,Homer,"hey, i see you're watchin' the ball game. looks like a good one. any of you involved in any illegal activity? cause i could sure go for some."
21136,Homer,ewww!
16157,Homer,right. that makes sense.
14022,Homer,"bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson."
21666,Homer,stand back and watch the pro.
13494,Homer,"she's right. okay, think, homer. don't panic. they don't pick up the mail till noon. there's still time!"
20263,Homer,"hey, what the hell's goin' on? where'd you get those cloaks?"
31162,Homer,thank god i brought protection.
41120,Homer,it's important i get a hold of him. i have to tell him i don't care about his money and i love him.
26171,Homer,no problem. there's plenty of activities inside.
34474,Homer,community service? but... that's work! what about jail?
15005,Homer,where are we going?
36895,Homer,"that's right, your lord sticks his hand in his pants. and yes, it is the same hand i tapped you with."
16783,Homer,"god, if you really are god, you'll get me tickets to that game."
40918,Homer,find a husband? which one's selma again?
40127,Homer,"to me."""
30901,Homer,"oh marge, thank god you're back! she made me spend time with the kids. and not just tv time. talking time!"
24379,Homer,my pockets hurt.
28734,Homer,"thank you. thank you. remember, my dog up and died. thank you."
30622,Homer,"stupid italy... wish you'd never been unified by victor emmanuel the second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring."
21285,Homer,hi moe.
19633,Homer,it could be days before they find us.
22879,Homer,"oh, let's get out of here."
14420,Homer,"all right, we're back in business."
22149,Homer,the force?!
33101,Homer,that's it!
13381,Homer,"none of your business, flanders."
13282,Homer,i dunno.
15556,Homer,"bart, warm up the car. we're going to duff gardens."
16488,Homer,"yeah, yeah."
21646,Homer,i borrowed your wallet!
22375,Homer,what one?
16163,Homer,yes sir. reject the first offer. reject the first offer.
14315,Homer,just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
30799,Homer,gotcha.
33106,Homer,i know -- i was hoping the number might be zero.
40961,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, well, i wish i could help you but we're looking for my brother today. can you tell me his name?"
27791,Homer,it's a concern. a serious concern.
27948,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll build you a new treehouse. one so grand it'll be an affront to god himself."
24141,Homer,"oh, save me jebus!"
14634,Homer,a dinosaur.
33093,Homer,i wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
32125,Homer,i wasn't talking to you.
15014,Homer,"no offense apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
23204,Homer,i'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.
34656,Homer,why should i? the city's broke! they can't afford to enforce their precious laws!
13528,Homer,"oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
30402,Homer,i repeat: did you sleep with kirk?
23918,Homer,"why, marge, i believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it."
14846,Homer,you weren't so glad to see me.
32935,Homer,"mom, i'm so sorry. you just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. well, if i get out of this i promise you i'll grant your last wish."
37125,Homer,it was during happy hour. don't you want our baby to be happy?
20230,Homer,"so what do you like, lisa? viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?"
27978,Homer,"i don't care if his name is bony mcdork, just make the checks out to me."
28182,Homer,woo-hoo!
25428,Homer,"okay. so, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?"
19243,Homer,the abandoned warehouse!
26361,Homer,"gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... swings in the old battin' cage."
25184,Homer,uh-huh.
26669,Homer,"it's been three days. and my mind is clearer, my sperm count is up, and i'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns."
37491,Homer,yes!
40071,Homer,who told you?
33330,Homer,"if you say so, m'lord."
29117,Homer,"oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be marge."
28154,Homer,off you go.
14822,Homer,"well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when tv's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
35979,Homer,"this place is so great. when the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt."
17779,Homer,clown college? you can't eat that.
19901,Homer,"well, sorry, i'm not in that business anymore."
34703,Homer,that was awesome. i feel like the tiger woods of sex.
38177,Homer,"""you have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" ooo, a support rock!"
29715,Homer,why you little... i'll endanger you!
35422,Homer,woo hoo!
15862,Homer,"look, there's bobby mindich, the class clown."
33849,Homer,i was an astronaut for a little bit. so many rules.
19498,Homer,...but our sames go right down to the bone. maybe we do have a...
19842,Homer,"it's been st. patrick's day for hours and i'm still not drunk yet. oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock."
25173,Homer,"heh, heh. ""grill power."""
35388,Homer,"marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. it's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
35181,Homer,huh? this one didn't make me feel anything.
25373,Homer,"so, ah, what songs did i miss?"
18076,Homer,"yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
40085,Homer,"well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."
38812,Homer,next year... this is... your job.
19880,Homer,"remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. we're patriots. like... all those people in jail."
21003,Homer,it's my first day.
24685,Homer,"all right. ""open stuck drawer..."" all-righty."
26493,Homer,"oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
23341,Homer,can't get enough of that sugar crisp...
29443,Homer,"one... two... eh, i'd rather die."
40892,Homer,"mr. burns! bart... quick. hide the stuff i ""borrowed"" from work."
25747,Homer,"aw, aren't they sweet. any medical things i should know about?"
35719,Homer,so tired... go on without me.
36105,Homer,onnnnnnneee...
38986,Homer,what the? lasagna in bed?!
32266,Homer,street cattle?
31558,Homer,"oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? who we goin' after?"
14395,Homer,"boy, i know you're gonna like your present."
39131,Homer,all right.
17557,Homer,that's okay. you don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. she can get on a plane. that's plenty.
35750,Homer,"how could the publishers change our book? if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!"
16375,Homer,"oooh, floor pie."
26773,Homer,"marge, why are you crying? you're not in any physical pain. the only kind of pain a man can understand."
29127,Homer,no one calls me unpatriotic.
23607,Homer,"not anymore, ron. now, i'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. something noble, but easy."
34028,Homer,"you see, he hasn't changed!"
36644,Homer,"my burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, i talk about how much money i'm going to make from the lawsuit."
30663,Homer,i told grampa we'd be away
38215,Homer,coming! i haven't forgotten about the sausage.
35084,Homer,awww...
15479,Homer,"well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and i'm not gonna sugarcoat it."
19650,Homer,come on. there's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
20364,Homer,you want me to get the cat down?
18122,Homer,what for? nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in hollywood.
27660,Homer,it was an application to open a cinnabon stand.
39398,Homer,"hey, if they think i'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken."
35519,Homer,oh. okay.
13729,Homer,how much does it pay?
40329,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, flanders?"
30473,Homer,"gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
28134,Homer,"no way! i'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. but if i lose maggie, i'm oh-for-three. i've gotta get her back."
30301,Homer,you're needed at home!
15226,Homer,i've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
29630,Homer,why you little...
36952,Homer,absolutely not! my adult frame is simply too large. no! never! fine! here i come!
27947,Homer,"woo hoo! in your face, imaginary guy!"
30139,Homer,she'll be fine here under the watchful eye of grandma shark week.
17048,Homer,no talking.
26883,Homer,i want to confess. i killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. marge is completely innocent. the only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder i did.
39789,Homer,"two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! i'm a blimp! why are all the good things so tasty? from now on, exercise every morning."
27514,Homer,so that's your answer! i'll sue the church!
30630,Homer,"i always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""
17393,Homer,oh that. no. i was just grabbing a gummy venus de milo that got stuck to your pants.
32251,Homer,"hey apu, what happened to all your milk?"
21478,Homer,i don't think anything i've ever done is wrong.
34425,Homer,"chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?"
17851,Homer,booting?
28143,Homer,"get your own family, moe."
26789,Homer,this is going great.
26743,Homer,who knew that anger was savin' my life?
15095,Homer,the doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
21700,Homer,"this is legal, right?"
24772,Homer,"marge, your posture looks terrible."
24304,Homer,but that's barney's seat. are you tryin' to make me the new barney?
18531,Homer,ants!
28517,Homer,oh my god! it's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
23085,Homer,shimatta baka-me!
28546,Homer,"you're a hero, homer j. / you're as crafty as a skunk / they'll thank you in the morning for stealing flanders' junk / homer jaaaaay! / you're a double-bacon genius-burger... and just a little drunk."
29505,Homer,you better be strong
31780,Homer,the clown on this cereal box is just a person!
24748,Homer,"oh, must hide lisa...!"
25660,Homer,to heaven!
17408,Homer,hee hee. here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
18300,Homer,we'll be right back.
19322,Homer,i already did.
24913,Homer,"i am not a number, i am a man. and don't you ever... oh, wait, i'm number 5. ha ha! in your face, number 6!"
26183,Homer,a heavenly choir. you must be an angel!
14259,Homer,"yeah, what do you want?"
29072,Homer,no. i won't. there's only one way i can escape from this nightmare.
20224,Homer,"well, moe, this is it. today's the day i get my new air conditioner."
14017,Homer,"i like our chances, son."
14255,Homer,okay.
40588,Homer,"sorry to scare you like that, babe."
32519,Homer,uh-huh.
18602,Homer,"aw, marge, we were so close to winning the championship. now thanks to burns it's never gonna happen. and i spent so much time building that trophy case."
20649,Homer,you shut up.
20917,Homer,"so, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?"
38002,Homer,wait!
28359,Homer,"okay, mother's day gift check. let's see what you got."
23201,Homer,"hi, marge. it's me, homer."
38607,Homer,"i'm not screwing you over. no, uh... i'm not screwing you over. i'm not screwing you over."
28730,Homer,"close, but no cigar. just plain diamonds."
32478,Homer,"listen marge... i've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? let's face it... you could do better."
14830,Homer,don't i get some kind of trophy? at a big award ceremony?
33629,Homer,chocolate.
40289,Homer,"that's right, ned."
40197,Homer,ah! uh... i'm just resting my eyes. holy moly! nine-thirty.
17803,Homer,"look, you're gonna be having dinner with groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
22137,Homer,why do you talk that way?
16777,Homer,oh stupid sheep.
32157,Homer,"hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?"
33877,Homer,a prop knife!
28984,Homer,it is.
24350,Homer,...and three makes three.
24457,Homer,"look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
28494,Homer,that thing for me.
20158,Homer,and why are you and the old lady in the car?
27102,Homer,"wait, don't go! i wanna keep on rockin'. c'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
36131,Homer,"pretty dope, don't you think?"
38808,Homer,"yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?"
13734,Homer,"yeah, right. son... i'm gonna teach you a lesson. i'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. then maybe you'll learn..."
31409,Homer,ice cream man! wait!
23451,Homer,"hello, kitty."
24601,Homer,"i'm not gonna stand for this. i'm gonna call the newspapers, the tv stations, the gas stations, everybody."
32939,Homer,god bless america!
37662,Homer,people called him the sixth simpson. not sure why.
32972,Homer,stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
40889,Homer,"quick, it's moe. i gotta hide the mugs..."
28697,Homer,what are you doing here?
35093,Homer,why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?
21389,Homer,i am at work. this is what i do.
13259,Homer,"just one minute left to get into heaven! there's gotta be some good deed i can do. c'mon, think, think."
26090,Homer,"ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
30004,Homer,where's my bucket?!
19202,Homer,"marge, will you let me finish? ...plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --"
17866,Homer,"marge, we had a deal. your sisters don't come here after six, and i stop eating your lipstick."
26941,Homer,even dessert?
31734,Homer,it's not right. it's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
14447,Homer,see? got her on the first bounce.
34838,Homer,"no, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. goodnight!"
29152,Homer,what genius put a prison on the middle of an island?
28452,Homer,"welcome to the homer simpson show. i'm your host, next card. homer simpson it's great to be here in next card. springfield my guests are...moe szyslak, local businessman, carl carlson, raconteur, and lenny leonard, three-time juror. gentlemen, what's on your minds?"
33967,Homer,"now listen, son, i know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. do it at the schoolyard. someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass joe biden."
28934,Homer,this is fat load. i'd like to request a new codename.
15398,Homer,"not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow i managed to fit in eight hours of tv a day."
31814,Homer,all because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
26495,Homer,"uh, we'll wait for the next one."
30045,Homer,"okay morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard."
23802,Homer,i don't know.
36234,Homer,crepes!
33301,Homer,"hold still, sweetie. daddy will kill it. and this time no screw-ups."
33110,Homer,"no, i'm trying to get me drunk."
23587,Homer,"remember springfield, keep on swinging!"
38471,Homer,but...
36281,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath."
38332,Homer,"hey kids, wanna chase grandpa homer around the house?"
38663,Homer,"i'll explain. okay, it starts free, right?"
41506,Homer,"sing me my bedtime song, mom."
29780,Homer,will you raise them christian?
30594,Homer,and tell me i'm not fat.
32918,Homer,"i always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
15614,Homer,wasn't me.
14290,Homer,"yeah!!! whoa! excellent, marge!"
27849,Homer,now you're just making up rules. who made you judge judy and executioner?
16206,Homer,"uh, huh."
21036,Homer,then i'll whomp him with my hat.
29415,Homer,"dammit! i would've been perfect as rachel's irish cousin. so you're all doing each other, are ya? well, who's going to put out for old seamus?"
39229,Homer,"oh, yeah my christmas bonus. how silly of me. this'll be the best christmas yet. the best any family ever had. heh-heh."
33266,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait... i read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. is that true?"
41182,Homer,"come on, marge. paint. i think you can do it."
38994,Homer,it is!
16154,Homer,"don't worry, boy. he'll be ready for your aunt selma's birthday."
39595,Homer,"bart-the-bloody-pulp simpson is on the ropes. he's hoping i'll put him out of his misery. well, you're in luck, bart, here comes my right."
15436,Homer,thank you.
26141,Homer,two... one...
41269,Homer,that cactus is right. i've only got one chance. i got to knock him out.
39417,Homer,"oh, sit tight. i'll be right back."
25889,Homer,"oh, yeah... i forget things sometimes..."
29466,Homer,"marge, you can't go with me to moe's. i mean, how would you like it if i came with you to your mother's?"
40278,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. you can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. you make me sick."
18372,Homer,i've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or i gotta face another day at work.
24524,Homer,"that slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. it gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. i returned to my first love, the legitimate theater."
19174,Homer,dressing?
21141,Homer,"hey, he's right..."
35321,Homer,"masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
15253,Homer,can't talk... eating.
32813,Homer,"marge, my fringes are knotted again."
29992,Homer,here's a corner.
38634,Homer,killdozers.
16069,Homer,i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart. s-m-r-t...i mean s-m-a-r-t.
14630,Homer,"marge, i've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
18844,Homer,mmmm... pointy.
27866,Homer,way ahead of you.
33164,Homer,awww.
18233,Homer,let me get a pad....
26717,Homer,what kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
25402,Homer,"my heart was in the right place, jerk!"
18619,Homer,"well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
41341,Homer,now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.
22674,Homer,"so i said to that nurse, ""you can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""
41450,Homer,"wish me luck, dad."
21045,Homer,we have orders not to fire on anybody but greenpeace.
35873,Homer,don't argue in front of the airport line. strangers are judging our marriage!
17143,Homer,woo hoo! a four day weekend!
22219,Homer,"slave girl? oh, slave girl?"
22531,Homer,oh no you don't!
18393,Homer,you dragged me all the way from work for that?
32832,Homer,hmm... that sounds like tress macneille.
22993,Homer,"hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. i'm gonna read it just as soon as i finish what i'm doing here."
15070,Homer,i know.
17203,Homer,tv town! hammock land!
20012,Homer,he did.
23857,Homer,have you nerds forgotten everything i taught you? this calls for a prank. i see a bucket...
36030,Homer,then why am i paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
26985,Homer,ned...
31966,Homer,"moe, can we talk?"
17993,Homer,great. there's only one thing i ask in return.
19604,Homer,"hmmm. your ideas are intriguing to me, and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but i think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
37559,Homer,"okay. i'm ready for the nuclear workers convention! it's a little sad. the guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick."
23655,Homer,but the cans seal in the flavor.
23740,Homer,"okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
31676,Homer,"yeah, how 'bout that?"
38409,Homer,question. it says here the murderer is admiral wainsworth. who's that?
27230,Homer,"he's not coming, is he? is he?"
18536,Homer,"no, i work at the nuclear power plant."
35965,Homer,i got a good song fever / a ted nugent fever / something something fever...
32481,Homer,no thanks -- just here for a battery.
31177,Homer,"he's talkin' like the guy in ""fat albert."" howba areba youba?"
39121,Homer,"yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?"
25538,Homer,"oh, the bag boys are on strike! i'm shaking."
15276,Homer,how someone someone abuse their body that way?
29936,Homer,wait a minute. i went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. somebody owes me big!
28888,Homer,"marge, i did it out of love. love of not being arrested. but i realize now that nothing is more important than you."
20041,Homer,"good morning, fellow employee. you'll notice that i am now a model worker. we should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. sincerely, homer simpson."
41568,Homer,i paid for her dreams / she taught me to cry / like watery knives / like rain from my eyes / i can't believe you're not mine / i can't believe you're not mine...
18836,Homer,troy mcclure? he's a washed-up movie star. he could be dating washed-up supermodels.
16985,Homer,"where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free hbo - oooh, ""free willy!"""
35206,Homer,oh no! chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
37024,Homer,parking meter?!
15584,Homer,no! duff... gardens... hurrah!
14547,Homer,i put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
28233,Homer,"now, i'm not a man who's good with words..."
20498,Homer,"marge, i need a small favor. for the next few days, will you pretend to be apu's wife?"
32987,Homer,"this taser is awesome. finally, a practical use for electricity."
19091,Homer,"marge! i've got a new job! it's with globex corporation. i get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. and they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
33160,Homer,help! fat man hanging from a tree!
13495,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
25795,Homer,"oh, this'll be good."
20048,Homer,you wish.
34221,Homer,"and now, marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. i'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
23036,Homer,"it's just that you and maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while i got marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive."
36775,Homer,"will you kids pipe down! i'm trying to get ""churro-chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. what country is mexico in?"
21904,Homer,"oh, yeah? when's the last time you freaked out the establishment? you guys are total sellouts."
26745,Homer,"i love you, boy."
32207,Homer,and the home of the bra-a-ave!
36481,Homer,"welcome, money-changers! you can trust sleazy sam for the best rates, or my name isn't jesus h.--"
25886,Homer,i thought i would hate working nights. but it's so peaceful. and there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
19536,Homer,"i was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods."

30240,Homer,"a scam? not according to ""eddie f. from tucson,"" or ""football millionaire in beloit, michigan."""
35794,Homer,"please, lisa. i had eighteen martinis today."

17280,Homer,"...fading, fading, gone."
16290,Homer,my wife's having a girls' night out.
31645,Homer,"that's okay, boy. the two of us got to talking."
27264,Homer,"good idea, lisa."
21256,Homer,do we want old man patterson here with his finger on the button?
30574,Homer,"oh, that poor woman. i am gonna find her a friend! someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh."
27272,Homer,don't struggle. you'll only sink faster.
35300,Homer,"boy, get down from there!"
20823,Homer,these lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. oh! a lima bean that looks just like the leader! i'll put it with the others.
34058,Homer,"oh i don't think so! you know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? she's the first lady of france, carla bruni!"

28843,Homer,"ow, my ankles snapped."
30001,Homer,"marge, i'm giving birth to a food baby."

37320,Homer,that was yesterday.
16392,Homer,"in a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
28710,Homer,"rollin', rollin', rollin' / toxic barrel rollin'"
18609,Homer,"goodbye, trophy."
18387,Homer,check core temperature? yes-slash-no. yes.
17997,Homer,keep it down in there!
37956,Homer,"we've talked about this, marge. the hammock is a chore-free zone."
40183,Homer,"-- thy god hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!"
38585,Homer,don't yell at me! i'm a double widower! but i can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!
26304,Homer,stop the madness! start the movie!
19691,Homer,i'm sure we will.
36118,Homer,i've been thinking. i really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. so i'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
28851,Homer,"come on, we'll have a blast. kids, while we're out, the tv's in charge. go to bed when it says."
28706,Homer,"marge, i've got it all figured out: lee harvey oswald wanted to steal the jack ruby."
26140,Homer,"this is launch master homer, counting down. five, four, three..."
28037,Homer,look at those suckers in their metal coffins. i can go to work any way i want.
38062,Homer,because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
21528,Homer,"if she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys."
18818,Homer,what am i -- a doctor?
22101,Homer,hold it! what's your clearance?
32042,Homer,it's over? that wasn't so bad.
15613,Homer,"it's that record club. the first nine were only a penny. then they jacked up the price! it's not fair, it's not fair i tells ya."
34864,Homer,"okay, burnsie, follow the carrot!"
37480,Homer,it's no use. we're perfectly matched.
26483,Homer,"give me those keys. do you have any idea what you put us through? i called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... okay, this isn't about who i called."
21475,Homer,"hello, everybody."

39151,Homer,"all right, princess. i'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital f."
38838,Homer,"oh, well, i've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best."
23882,Homer,woo hoo! go s.u.!
41573,Homer,"at least we know there'll never be a president worse than bill clinton. imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit. that's the worst sin a president could commit."
16191,Homer,"well well, look whose come to apologize."
38864,Homer,let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
21707,Homer,"shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. i'm gonna, like, totally waste you."
33961,Homer,woo hoo! there's no better violence than self-inflicted violence!
30410,Homer,"well, i'd better go."
30093,Homer,huh. my watch must be running fast. wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
37583,Homer,moving my body.
17164,Homer,hm...
30114,Homer,how come it's not open yet?
28353,Homer,"hey, this place is amazing. it's fit for a duke, or even an earl..."
17290,Homer,i've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. ok. don't panic. remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
26504,Homer,fine.
27799,Homer,"you may be a smart kid, lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
24991,Homer,"here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you."
26160,Homer,"so, you think you know better than this family, huh. well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what i do and believe what i believe. so butter your bacon!"
23744,Homer,uh-oh.
22297,Homer,"well, turn something on. i'm starting to think."
30917,Homer,you mean...
32536,Homer,"what's going on, why are you attacking me? look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in good 'n' plenty colors!"
36138,Homer,"here car. here, boy."
21257,Homer,what-what-what. what button? where am i? who took my false teeth?
14905,Homer,"well, this is the first i've heard about it."

21132,Homer,"c'mon... where are you?... here, trilly, trilly."
17231,Homer,it is the '70s! right down to the smallest detail!
30576,Homer,"son, i need to find a new friend for your mother. so you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself."
18901,Homer,pass.

18371,Homer,beautiful. g'night.
35869,Homer,finally. the only thing i wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
28682,Homer,"so, how much bleach did you drink? not a talker, eh?"
37876,Homer,"oh, boy. monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. the only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
31107,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
13758,Homer,"i don't understand anything! when they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
30307,Homer,and what a man!
25961,Homer,this thing pays for itself.
22039,Homer,liability waiver?
15044,Homer,"dad, am i cute as a bug's ear?"
35864,Homer,"to prove a point. everyone thinks their dad's a jerk and everyone's right. but when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
30606,Homer,what's in you?
23367,Homer,"bart, spooky roller disco."
23258,Homer,here we are kids -- the zoo.

19199,Homer,"well, i trust you, moe. if you say i can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance."
25116,Homer,dammit!

15519,Homer,mono...
26647,Homer,"whoa, whoa, one question at a time. yes, you?"
30585,Homer,"marge... in a gang? what're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? seriously, i would love that."
19921,Homer,do you think he noticed?
39639,Homer,wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
28896,Homer,"oh no! it's a real one! noooooo! why god, why?"
17810,Homer,"i'm telling you, marge, this will work. they'll think i'm krusty and give us free stuff. i've been gettin' free stuff all day. look at this swell bucket of house paint."
25230,Homer,"sorry, son."
30186,Homer,"shut up, flanders. but some things i could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit..."
19957,Homer,uh-huh.
22390,Homer,local man has same name. a tv character has the same name as springfield resident homer simpson.
20764,Homer,"i've got a proposition for you, cooder."
14963,Homer,this things i believe.
25069,Homer,"i know, ranch dressing."
31456,Homer,"marge, i wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures i broke. okay?"
15942,Homer,my wallet's in the car.
29960,Homer,why did i give her a gun? but i repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. until all the kinks are worked out.
31846,Homer,"foul on the other girl. lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!"
38248,Homer,wave a brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
23194,Homer,"hey, what about a prequel to something? everybody loves prequels."
39983,Homer,"oh, okay. then i'll take that one there with the beady eyes."
28858,Homer,uh-oh. here comes the gospel according to puke.
35480,Homer,shut up.
19909,Homer,"hey, does this mean that mrs. krabappel is a virgin, too?"

36209,Homer,you left him because i tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
36352,Homer,"okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
22301,Homer,"oh, i hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over."
19395,Homer,past instances in which i professed to like you were fraudulent.
29477,Homer,"well, i might as well use this pucker for something."
27169,Homer,"you know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
37138,Homer,not again!
20582,Homer,pfft. friends of the library?
16790,Homer,duck! i can't let the boys see me with you!
13414,Homer,we're back!
17425,Homer,"oh, i wouldn't want to be mr. t right now."
25665,Homer,"flanders has cooties, flanders has cooties."
32562,Homer,another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my tv guide?
31656,Homer,"aw, my little girl's just like cbs news."
19283,Homer,"hi! now, marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about bart working in a burlesque house..."
20884,Homer,"take that, you greedy fat cats. marge, gimme your purse."
27921,Homer,and fight the crowds? forget it. the simpsons are going to bart's idea!
36820,Homer,"okay, where did you get these donuts?"
23092,Homer,why are you so cruel?
16394,Homer,now i have to face stupid reality again!... flanders! my socks feel dirty! gimme some water to wash 'em!
36333,Homer,"now, if the korean couple can't speak english, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? what does it mean?"
40273,Homer,"for the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."
34024,Homer,can't we just all supervise ourselves?
16367,Homer,explain how.
28753,Homer,"hey, apu, what's with the line?"
25721,Homer,run!
18892,Homer,"okay! go, boy! go find help! go find help, boy!"
32267,Homer,i think it goes here.
35240,Homer,"c'mon, if art garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp paul simon, you can do this."
26707,Homer,come on... unfold you...
18105,Homer,lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
20739,Homer,i understand.
16872,Homer,y'ello.
32154,Homer,marge... i've gotta be honest...
39429,Homer,are you sure that's enough? you know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
39791,Homer,"good idea, marge. by the way, this friday night i'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. eugene fisk is marrying some girl in valve maintenance."
13604,Homer,"it's not just one magazine, marge. they take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
15802,Homer,so thirsty... eh. what're you gonna do?
18260,Homer,one whopper for the copper.
30963,Homer,i am a god! i know all!
37103,Homer,"like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
30598,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp... bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
31754,Homer,where is he? where is he? i smell his aftershave!
29206,Homer,"c'mon, shoot me a new one!"
19546,Homer,"that's my boy. well, if you believe in me, then i'm not going to give up. i'll prove i'm right. this friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
33594,Homer,"who are you, stuttering fonzie? what about you, bicycle pants?"
22344,Homer,"uh-oh. lateral, to bart!"
36840,Homer,"""star wars"" chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary."
18459,Homer,i thought you were dead.
16116,Homer,and all those other pranks were my idea too. i'm the one who should be expelled.
37005,Homer,"marge, when i started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
13659,Homer,"no, it isn't."
40998,Homer,"okay, we're watching."
15883,Homer,true.
37195,Homer,"no one feels out a unit like cj! not bubba, not debbie and danny, no one!"
22934,Homer,can't we go home yet? my feet hurt. all this fresh air is making my hair move. and i don't know how much longer i can complain.
15263,Homer,so you think i have a case?
15180,Homer,all right. i think you've learned your lesson.
31546,Homer,you could caramel my arm...
26477,Homer,"oh, no. i'm not giving you my car. you'll probably drive it."
30549,Homer,why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
17553,Homer,did you talk about me in therapy today?
22403,Homer,i wish i hadn't bought a hundred of these.
32783,Homer,"hee-hee. okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes..."
37947,Homer,marge and i get along perfect. we're like george burns and john denver.
31919,Homer,how is that possible?
33635,Homer,what's going on? what's with all the darkness? hello? marge! where am i?
31929,Homer,i have three kids and no money! why can't i have no kids and three money?
31703,Homer,"all those years i was dreaming of other things, i was actually doing what i really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"
17959,Homer,"yeah, well you think i'm stupid."
19158,Homer,"well... thanks for everything, hank."
20379,Homer,they're here! they're here!
37908,Homer,"ooo, mastermind."
14237,Homer,pfft. now you tell me.
23544,Homer,"mmm, who is that? big ugly nose... bald... liver spot... liver spot... mmmm."
29446,Homer,dammit.
17834,Homer,"no, i'm gonna ask marge."
22146,Homer,"i think i saw him in ""rent,"" or ""stomp,"" or ""clomp,"" or some piece of crap."
31483,Homer,"okay sweetie, which book should i read?"
14728,Homer,"guess what, lurleen, i got you a gig on tv."
24607,Homer,the who? i love bands!
33447,Homer,"i mean, nooo!"
31495,Homer,...as headmaster greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard maluicious krubb.
28366,Homer,"i could get marge a new window, just like this one."
32110,Homer,"the camera's not on yet, right?"
39206,Homer,it's your sister.
35804,Homer,"of course, of course. family is everything to us company men. now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
13747,Homer,"hey, when do we get the check for this?"
22220,Homer,whuh?
20390,Homer,o-kay!
14667,Homer,"oh wait, i heard how this ends. it turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
21143,Homer,"take that, uncle sam!"
14840,Homer,give me full power.
38716,Homer,"aw, let me get a picture of that."
37882,Homer,"okay, i've gotta go see the radioactive man movie before it gets totally ruined for me."
33339,Homer,i doubt it -- friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
13728,Homer,"that's officer homer. heh heh, heh, heh."
23440,Homer,lousy show-offs.
32925,Homer,"wait a minute... mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. mom! you used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
25404,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll handle this."
28191,Homer,"just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
37633,Homer,how 'bout this one?
17101,Homer,i give up. i don't deserve to live with you.
29220,Homer,"oh, mag... no wait, this is yours."
35124,Homer,marge? what are you doing here? this bar is for singles and wingmen only.
40412,Homer,"stop it, you two! this is thanksgiving! so glue friendly, or i'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!"
28222,Homer,they all do.
19496,Homer,"right, and we don't like the same things. it's like you're from venus..."
30701,Homer,"oh, which way did mason go? that must be him over there."
14211,Homer,because it's the honorable thing to do?
27693,Homer,"hey there, little red riding hood. i ate your granny and now i'm in the mood for love."
23144,Homer,sweet.
31537,Homer,"a hundred and seventeen degrees! ooo, that reminds me."
28597,Homer,"there's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""dad i don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""
29942,Homer,at what time?
41327,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson, a.k.a. ""happy dude."" the court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. i'm sorry. if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one dollar to sorry dude, 742 evergreen terrace, springfield... you have the power."
35669,Homer,here's what i do: pick the thing that marge would hate the most...
27545,Homer,look. see. you're fine. and then--oops! uh-oh. look out...
15992,Homer,"well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--"
33690,Homer,"man, that made me thirsty."
30151,Homer,scantily-clad co-eds?
19403,Homer,"ned, you so crazy."
13305,Homer,"lisa, don't hold anything back. you can tell me. are you crying because you called daddy a baboon?"
36773,Homer,"sorry, boss."
25683,Homer,"uh, yeah, teenagers."
34754,Homer,"boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
17855,Homer,"when will you australians learn? in america, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. the streets are safe. old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. so, like us, let your children run wild and free. because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. now boy, run back to the embassy! back to american soil!"
19146,Homer,eh... i... no.
41569,Homer,marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine...
39560,Homer,thanks for knowing i mean well.
29036,Homer,flanders!? he's not man enough to trim my crust. i mean pie man's crust. i'm not pie man.
34360,Homer,woo hoo!
16460,Homer,uh oh.
31552,Homer,"nice brush work, emily. nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her."
31070,Homer,"it was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know..."

13761,Homer,"okay, okay, think back to your training..."
27262,Homer,that's it! tv was the one good thing in my life and now i can't enjoy it any more.
21896,Homer,"c'mon, maude. the human wang is a beautiful thing."
16079,Homer,"you see that, sir. drops his notes."
31460,Homer,"if it would win you back, i would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. i hope it doesn't come to that. could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
32088,Homer,"yeah, but i'm on a plane, idiot."
26414,Homer,ouch! i sat on something sharp!
28656,Homer,i'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
18979,Homer,"that's fine for you, marge. but i used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. then it was every other day. now i'm lucky if i can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. i've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
29179,Homer,these batteries have to power everything in our house!
30982,Homer,why thee little...
25489,Homer,three dollars? that doesn't seem so bad.
30740,Homer,you know who would really like this place? bart. wait a minute... where the hell is bart?
39690,Homer,"we'll die together, like a father and son should."
40325,Homer,"don't toy with me, woman."
22002,Homer,"let's see. one, two, three... six whiskeys!"
41196,Homer,hey! you don't have to pay! read the sign!
30560,Homer,"uh, well, my son is here too. let's meet him now."
28986,Homer,"and tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump."
38408,Homer,they'll get their blood money.
17541,Homer,oh.
40443,Homer,"yeah, boy. get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness."
23447,Homer,"yeah, it'll be fun. fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
29237,Homer,"marge, i don't want to buy this house. i'd have to live next door to myself."
31027,Homer,my work here is done.
16129,Homer,"oh, marge. you're worse than that crusty old dean."
31431,Homer,love you!
16970,Homer,"how many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?"
40761,Homer,"i'll take that, you stinkpot! just warming up, mrs. bloominstein."
30370,Homer,"i know, and you did, and you're great."
33389,Homer,okay.
36017,Homer,which one do you want?
31061,Homer,"well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose."
26054,Homer,"let's see. ""you will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""you will find true love on flag day."" ""your store is being robbed, apu."" are you getting all this, lisa?"
27544,Homer,i needed it. i had to buy back some incriminating photos.
37336,Homer,"well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy."
27496,Homer,"o, merciful god, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."
23274,Homer,"no, no, you're right. it's a joke. everyone laugh at the funny joke . i'll be right back with the real review."
15951,Homer,"every afternoon at moe's, chief wiggum, principal skinner, apu and i would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild."
38030,Homer,"that's ""alias."" du-uh."
17162,Homer,"there you are. thought you could get away, huh?"
38530,Homer,"aw, somebody wants more crusts. here you go, boy!"
20128,Homer,flushing meadows...
38379,Homer,"hey, you know, i don't think this guy likes girls."
19523,Homer,"yes. remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
18735,Homer,"less chat, more hat."
41148,Homer,don't you ever do that to me again.
21663,Homer,"yeah, quit stalling, marge. we want our reward."
35848,Homer,i meant a week from tomorrow. that's when the new penis gets here.
26811,Homer,"good night, bart."
31314,Homer,"hey, i'm not done dancin'! this bulletin better swing!"
26088,Homer,you mean a van dyke?
36197,Homer,"oh, lighten up, marge. i take you to the disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the lost and found. well guess what? we're stayin' in this dream forever!"
30743,Homer,why you little...
26628,Homer,"marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal."
22845,Homer,all right.
23018,Homer,"now's our opening. come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!"
21718,Homer,don't make me choose!
38690,Homer,"hey, there's always room at buzzard's roost."
21658,Homer,let's just say i'm sitting in the right chair.
30433,Homer,"the sad part is, there were times when i actually had feelings for you. i almost felt i was your father."
17042,Homer,"can't talk now, flanders. i've got a class to teach."
33813,Homer,that mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
37873,Homer,"oh right, we're still doing that."
27832,Homer,"okay, burger king! whatever! c'mon."
15345,Homer,"so i says, ""kiss my asphalt."" hmm? hmm?"
34457,Homer,patty and selma are dead? woo hoo! a double funeral!
21439,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
24537,Homer,this'll be the last season.
22500,Homer,now to trim away the fat.
23612,Homer,"listen, boy... i was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
38297,Homer,"yes, well it's a special evening. and i thought it best not to look like a monkey."
22351,Homer,"please, my friends... ow! all right, i'll get you into to the game!"
19933,Homer,"there, there, shut up, boy. we'll just get you a new dog."
31118,Homer,c'mon...
38589,Homer,hey... but today's not pork chop tuesday... or gravy thursday.
16589,Homer,"so i said to him, ""look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. and as for your grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
22854,Homer,now you're making sense. good night.
39172,Homer,"oh, god gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from linkedin."
27081,Homer,"uh-huh. now i'm afraid that if i stop talking, i'll die. isn't mick cool? i thought he'd be all like, ""i'm a rock star. aren't i great?"" but he's just like you or me or jesus over there."
40239,Homer,"you know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day."
32317,Homer,right... tomorrow.
19551,Homer,no! no! no-o-o-o-o!
40894,Homer,"now, c'mon. take all this, and this, put it in the closet."
24566,Homer,whaddaya think? do you love it?
33410,Homer,okay.
21068,Homer,all right. i can't waste any more time. people's lives are depending on me. mr. sulu -- make a left!
40555,Homer,whoo ooo! i stand corrected. a million bucks is a-okay!
18440,Homer,wait a minute! there's probably a --
24570,Homer,"boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
37659,Homer,"you killed burnsum? now who is gonna say ""step right up""?"
39303,Homer,"all right, look everybody. i have a confession to make."
37431,Homer,"wow, is that what your wife did?"
13912,Homer,"simpson, you've done it again."
29283,Homer,do you know what a boob is?
23132,Homer,'preciate it.
36267,Homer,"uh, right, right... actually, i'm the designated hitter for all you guys."
34293,Homer,"wonderful, homie."
40544,Homer,wow...
35391,Homer,"oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?"
19345,Homer,"marge, will you marry me?"
41276,Homer,as...? as...?!
13178,Homer,what is it you want from me? money? weed?
39822,Homer,"don't listen to him, marge, he's..."
28937,Homer,"yeah, he's crazy all right."
34554,Homer,haven't you learned anything from watching bart drive?
21110,Homer,"quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. it goes all the way to the president."
20026,Homer,"this is my wife, marge..."
36342,Homer,she walked away and slammed the door. what does it mean? what does it mean?
17210,Homer,"okay, let's make a pact. this is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
18960,Homer,"nobody knows the band, grand funk? the wild shirtless lyrics of mark farner? the bong-rattling bass of mel schacher? the competent drumwork of don brewer? oh, man."
15585,Homer,but i love solids.
25531,Homer,"y'know, i always felt sorry for marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."
20723,Homer,"thanks for the food, mister..."
33982,Homer,there certainly is.
25196,Homer,"less yakkin', more crackin'."
21826,Homer,"well, if alec is out, i'm out too. you're on your own, potsie."
13940,Homer,i'm your man!
17757,Homer,it's at times like this i wish i were a religious man.
32997,Homer,evidence that i love my little girl.
14204,Homer,really? it must be the champale talking.
37163,Homer,"whatever you say, sir."
20696,Homer,i knew i should've shut that window.
33261,Homer,hm. usually that ends the dream.
20907,Homer,maa-rrge...
41563,Homer,seeing marge always reminds me of marge.
29333,Homer,"marge, listen to me. chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. you're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together."
27592,Homer,now to win back my son in comfort and style.
25410,Homer,"nice place you got here. ooh look, a hair net. be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
36414,Homer,sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
39704,Homer,maybe.
29825,Homer,i won't tell if you don't tell.
16959,Homer,"hey, the trail of donuts ended. bart!"
35567,Homer,"why of course! even if i don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do."
15255,Homer,"but the sign said ""all you can eat."""
41389,Homer,"welcome to our tropical paradise. enjoy our luaus, our lagoons and our ladies... and remember, what happens in tahiti, stays in tahiti."
19250,Homer,"i'm a father myself, sir. and sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
17357,Homer,"moe, what are you doin' here?"
23901,Homer,poor guy. he lost his leg.
35186,Homer,your grandfather is not a monster.
28705,Homer,"don't worry about those losers, marge. i think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
16026,Homer,lousy speed bumps.
18785,Homer,the accounting department is located on the third floor. its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the head of this department is a mr. johnson or johnstone.
36208,Homer,there's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!
26457,Homer,dad!
40380,Homer,that's right!
25570,Homer,"yeah, it's like the allman brothers!"
18910,Homer,"mr. mayor, i hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
20771,Homer,they mushed it all out of shape.
40480,Homer,"oh, that never works. he's a goner."
24925,Homer,"look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
19999,Homer,i didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
23900,Homer,"bart, do your thing!"
33995,Homer,really?
15034,Homer,wow.
29474,Homer,"ah yes, detroit-style. very nice. so, you've been at moe's every night this week."
20192,Homer,brilliant! i have absolutely no idea what's going on.
30874,Homer,y'ello.
40531,Homer,"sit down, boy!"
27896,Homer,"marge, i never want to be apart from you again."
31343,Homer,are we that stupid?
37225,Homer,fine.
33842,Homer,s'open!
29887,Homer,i didn't really check. i mainly bought this house for the view.
38453,Homer,"hey, super mario. don't you tell me about america!"
18086,Homer,". fooled you flanders. made you think your family was dead. didja get it? they're not, though."
35200,Homer,back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. which was about three times.
18687,Homer,but sipowicz does it.
19044,Homer,"ooh, captain of the football team! he's a dreamboat! don't wait up, marge."
23284,Homer,woo hoo! stop the presses!
20153,Homer,"look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
17734,Homer,seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
33507,Homer,"according to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" finally, a practical use for my father."
18437,Homer,"get away, dammit! run for your lives!"
39659,Homer,"okay, slap a fern on there, boy. now, some mud. there. ooh! that requires a little mollusk. and mollusk for me. all right. we're ready to hit the town."
33697,Homer,and i'm good at beginnings.
19886,Homer,boom.
41275,Homer,"no, no! he'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
21522,Homer,"oh, you'll miss plenty. i have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives."
38246,Homer,"if i bet it, i could double it. but on who?"
36022,Homer,"well, your arms are lanky. it's kind of a long trip down there."
14445,Homer,she's startin' to give.
24169,Homer,really? you're proud of me?
33695,Homer,"oh maggie, i love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. god bless your mother for making you with me."
29852,Homer,"don't worry, marge -- hot wheels to the rescue!"
36997,Homer,the one thing i couldn't prepare for.
24598,Homer,"939?! what the hell is that? oh, my life is ruined."
25924,Homer,"well, that explains the sign."
29006,Homer,that sliding should stop soon.
34809,Homer,hyah! hyah!
24824,Homer,what are you doing here? i told you i'm not your monkey anymore.
14091,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
22084,Homer,neeerrrds!
37342,Homer,"i think i could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. bob's your uncle."
37569,Homer,"i'll kill you, you son of a--"
24747,Homer,"oh, praise god, you're alive! unless..."
39952,Homer,"i hope you do find that punk someday, moe. fill 'er up."
41226,Homer,uh-oh. i don't understand a word he's saying. why doesn't he just let me bat? i wish i was home with a big bag of potato chips... mmm potato chips.
40750,Homer,"oh, yeah."
28386,Homer,smooth.
23583,Homer,"hello, everybody!"
34238,Homer,"up -- that's my chair, boy."
23072,Homer,looks like he's doing a commercial.
28059,Homer,too hot! too hot!
36540,Homer,"i hope you enjoyed the show tonight. and if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of."
37530,Homer,uh... anniversary? that comin' up?
18553,Homer,"maybe it's ""sporting goods""... wait, no, ""sleepwear""... oh, probably ""better living."""
33377,Homer,"wait a second. if i'd been class president like i was supposed to, i'd be the one with the big mansion and the color tvs and the hot wife!"
39452,Homer,marge!
34529,Homer,"yeah, so is getting a real job."
23964,Homer,"in the net, right?"
33864,Homer,"thank you, friendo."
29167,Homer,now to do something i've never done before -- help out an old man.
15579,Homer,suggestion noted.
16427,Homer,"moe, i need your advice."
28126,Homer,your baby!
16105,Homer,"look! you pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
38903,Homer,it does look delicious.
26026,Homer,seems to me i already did.
15046,Homer,"moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
34249,Homer,"marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, i have something to confess. um... i wasn't there for that wedding toast because... i was buying a lottery ticket."
17594,Homer,this is it. my ticket in. they have to let me join if i'm the son of a member.
15914,Homer,woo-hoo!
35041,Homer,guess i'll put these tools away. put 'em on hooks and stuff.
31621,Homer,"monsieur meaux, i would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment."
24260,Homer,"right, right, present. anyway, can i get you some soylent green?"
34424,Homer,so salty... maybe if i... add a little salt...
34647,Homer,"today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
17905,Homer,you told!
37449,Homer,four lucky numbers for four best friends.
17657,Homer,thanks honey. bank shot.
24760,Homer,"okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. what are you gonna do about it?"
34713,Homer,did you say a hague?
32430,Homer,"hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. now i know why pimps are so happy."
23297,Homer,whew.
18598,Homer,you want to join my what?
15439,Homer,"oh ni-ight, di- vine. hey, my voice just changed."
34445,Homer,i'm pounding melchizedeks!
41036,Homer,"powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a nerf ball. now, at last, i have found it."
37166,Homer,but i just did that!
27365,Homer,"oh, lisa's still mad at me."
13334,Homer,really? well i do have a warm sense of well-being and i seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! give me another.
13497,Homer,"what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
24079,Homer,"so, how're you doing, ned?"
28049,Homer,i rarely feel the need to utter d'oh!
33425,Homer,"...three, two, one. happy new year!"
24521,Homer,i'll kill you!
15278,Homer,"but marge, alan thicke is throwing knives at ricardo montalban."
16856,Homer,"see, i told ya. there's nothin' to worry about. this place isn't..."
41581,Homer,okay. how long till we come back and get him?
39834,Homer,are you still mad?... you are still mad. no need to say it. i'm your loving husband. i can read you like a book. i'll just have some milk.
21876,Homer,no! homer simpson does not lie twice on the same form. he never has and he never will.
40330,Homer,"well, beggars can't be choosy."
17125,Homer,mmmm....
30184,Homer,after the party.
40842,Homer,marge --
38858,Homer,prove it.
40467,Homer,"let the destruction begin! hey, they forgot my corn dog."
27352,Homer,"one turbo diary, please."
24471,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
38449,Homer,oh thank god. a rickety bridge.
29569,Homer,how do i look?
33496,Homer,i'm the victim here!
24137,Homer,"sure, sure, bob's your uncle. let's just get outta here!"
22498,Homer,"c'mon, boy. c'mon!"
24439,Homer,talking while the tv's on can't be good for you.
31393,Homer,"hey, thanks for the heads-up! we'll see ya when we see ya!"
27364,Homer,"good morning, honey. did you cry out all your angries?"
25563,Homer,"what did you just see, lisa?"
33326,Homer,"okay, honey. if it's that important to you, you said it."
20111,Homer,stupid city! what the hell is this thing?
17438,Homer,let's never fight again.
36731,Homer,i'll fix that later!
34155,Homer,just with indifference.
39472,Homer,"another beer, moe."
31458,Homer,"that's okay, i can get it from the bank, honey. i just need to know your birthday."
13540,Homer,look at him!
39930,Homer,yeah. wait a minute. it's the guy from tv. my kid's hero... cruddy... crummy... krusty the clown!
31336,Homer,i don't understand. how does punishing them teach me a lesson?
37796,Homer,can i just say goodbye to him quick?
29012,Homer,"quiet, the commercial's on! if we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv."
32969,Homer,and if i don't show up?
14800,Homer,"ooh, sweet."
21160,Homer,"i'd like a monkey, please. and maybe one of those dogs. what do they do?"
14967,Homer,"oh, well... can't win 'em all."
28344,Homer,america rules! our beatles are way better than your precious rolling stones!
26516,Homer,that pig looks like lenny.
35915,Homer,"are you ready for irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""oh, that's a lovely touch! oh, such beautiful form!"" if we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, rudys, ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! ochocincos..."
13779,Homer,"well, as long as it's quiet."
18656,Homer,"oooh? hiding behind your goons, eh, bush? oooh! well, you are a wimp."
31351,Homer,"bring it on, chumps!"
13269,Homer,"boy, our son can be a real jerk. hey, you wanna have ghost sex?"
30942,Homer,lisa! it's me! i'm in trouble!
29558,Homer,"oh mighty god, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
33940,Homer,"apu, i have to lose weight now. do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
19974,Homer,why would you volunteer at the church?
24451,Homer,would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
27992,Homer,"i'm sorry i was ever mean to you. marge, prepare the celebration ham."
26345,Homer,"hey marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya."
35493,Homer,i'm waitin' for ya.
31307,Homer,"bart, there's something i have to tell you father to son. i passed out on your turtle and killed it. someday you'll thank me."
13907,Homer,u-su-ry?
18845,Homer,"that reminds me -- troy said something interesting last night at the bar. apparently he doesn't really love selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. well, enough talk. let's snuggle."
17755,Homer,"so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
39223,Homer,oh! big jar this year.
38940,Homer,"look, can we get to the point? i'm stack parked. did you hear me? stack..."
18182,Homer,i got my dad to look after her.
35962,Homer,it's not working... but why?
37013,Homer,so we'll take these supplies back to springfield where they're needed most.
20966,Homer,"c'mon, lisa, join the family!"
41422,Homer,not again.
37286,Homer,all too well.
23732,Homer,"yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. marge? marge?!"
17320,Homer,"oh good, here comes the collection plate."
40995,Homer,"you mean, if i want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
26739,Homer,time to put this ordeal behind me.
36621,Homer,"emotionally, financially, the boy... i just didn't know how to tell you."
20141,Homer,the boss says you're fired.
29760,Homer,"welcome, welcome. if my wife asks, you're here for a boz skaggs concert."
37898,Homer,shut up shut up shut up!
22657,Homer,"let's try some oil of lorenzo. and, uh, what's keeping joan rivers alive?"
14010,Homer,"what was that? ah, who cares. son, please let me help you."
37677,Homer,we've had some good times.
17300,Homer,these wieners will give me the quick energy i need to escape.
37380,Homer,lost sheep! yes! sis boom bah!
31062,Homer,"when a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
29400,Homer,"well, i'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
33855,Homer,try the flan de leche de cabra...
13147,Homer,"you know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
14441,Homer,"i know you do, marge. but come on, you know what our vacations are like. those three monsters in the back seat. ""are we there yet? are we there yet?"" and let's face it, i'm no day at the beach either. ""marge, can i have another sandwich? marge, can i have another sandwich?"""
37366,Homer,wait a minute! this has oats in it!
31870,Homer,my son caught the ball! this makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
14325,Homer,"uh, could you edit that last part out?"
34657,Homer,cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
32505,Homer,"finally, the ribs."
37581,Homer,"marge, i changed in boise. i'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed."
33380,Homer,dondelinger!
35786,Homer,i can't believe that was work!
39570,Homer,what th...
16088,Homer,"hiya, gang!"
25077,Homer,"c'mon, kids. let's leave this awful place and never come back."
18335,Homer,craaaaaaaaaap!
30697,Homer,woo hoo!
28744,Homer,it doesn't matter!
40657,Homer,no. let me hear you play.
15633,Homer,"son, i just want you to know i love you very much."
22037,Homer,blow up the hospital.
26118,Homer,something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
40013,Homer,"honey, can we make up again?"
21806,Homer,i'll get it! i'll get it!
19819,Homer,"well, i hope bob fed you, 'cause i ate your dinners."
22268,Homer,"""hitler is a jerk, mussolini..."""
30688,Homer,"i found this letter you wrote to my mom, mona simpson."
24347,Homer,i could do a lotta things if i had some money.
39784,Homer,"what a lovely surprise! you're here to see me, right?"
34508,Homer,fine! i'll stay a little more.
38960,Homer,i'm ready to go to school.
22015,Homer,"excuse me, doctor. i think i know a little something about medicine..."
35555,Homer,"hey, hey! what are you doing?"
25243,Homer,that thing got picture-in-picture?
34412,Homer,whatever. it's your camera.
33463,Homer,fine. i'll invite him. but he has to wear the outfit i choose.
28626,Homer,"bart, i'm sorry -- i could never build a robot this awesome. i'm a fraud."
13920,Homer,oh nuts.
24816,Homer,"hey, what happened to...?"
29966,Homer,"milkshake festival. look, you can see the booths from your window."
21895,Homer,"well, at least lose the bra. free the ""springfield two,"" marge! free the ""springfield two!"""
38386,Homer,"we're not lost, boy. not by a longshot. we just have to set the mood."
20710,Homer,"he's not just some ""guy,"" marge. he's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. carnies built this country. the carnival part of it, anyway. and though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."
21923,Homer,"aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. i just don't have the discipline to be a hippie."
40426,Homer,the hell with this.
17507,Homer,"hmmm. this looks like a nice, friendly place."
16746,Homer,i can't stands no more.
21805,Homer,"ooo, me-ow."
27197,Homer,"gentlemen, say hello to springfield's newest supermodel!"
26783,Homer,"mmm, caramel baloney."
33709,Homer,"yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
25046,Homer,"lenny, are you watching this?"
35771,Homer,woo hoo! no more church!
16341,Homer,"wow! for free, ""surplus drums of mayonnaise from operation desert storm."""
22660,Homer,me too.
20761,Homer,stupid gravity.
17022,Homer,huh? oh. okay. i'll take three.
25146,Homer,"lisa, why didn't you warn me? being a brain has alienated me from all my friends."
34662,Homer,"or frasier on ""frasier."""
36924,Homer,it doesn't make sense to me!
34195,Homer,"...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!"
30698,Homer,and my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
19229,Homer,"eh, i should go."
36491,Homer,"i will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where i always have to get to seventeen. voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! voop! whoops, i lost count. better start again. voop! voop! voop! voop!"
34233,Homer,race you to the cockpit!
17167,Homer,"marge, i want you to stop seeing this jacque. you can let him down gently. but over the next couple of months, i want you to break it off."
25788,Homer,"hey, wait a minute. ""airport tax, five dollars?"""
16041,Homer,"ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
19467,Homer,damn straight.
40620,Homer,mmmm. fan-fugu-tastic.
33656,Homer,a rocket ship wedding cake -- just what i always wanted!
38983,Homer,- parked! i hate stack parking! wait! where am i? this isn't the circus! it's an amusement park! the furthest thing from a circus!
22476,Homer,"yes, i learned you've gotta be yourself. g'night, honey."
27305,Homer,"now bob, i know you're concerned, but don't worry. i have operatives working the crowd."
37149,Homer,marge you will get the last pork chop...
28332,Homer,"okay, i'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool."
31879,Homer,woo hoo!
20478,Homer,"ooo, let's see what she wrote!"
27430,Homer,"no, i'm good."
30645,Homer,can i be the phantom of the opera?
16561,Homer,"lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
33534,Homer,"ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots vichy."
22074,Homer,"don't you dance out that door you... i'll get my kidney back, old man! you have to sleep sometime!"
23045,Homer,"sure, by their standards, but we live in america."
23611,Homer,i do what now?
37675,Homer,and while i'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
21221,Homer,"i came to fight city hall. i wanna shake things up, patterson. stir up some controversy. rattle a few cages."
20522,Homer,"you know what you could do, apu..."
34692,Homer,"now that i have all this free time, i thought i would do you a huge favor."
19226,Homer,why? it's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
17435,Homer,"oh, that man is sick!"
17751,Homer,"lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. just like that rain forest scare a few years back. our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. didn't they?"
30038,Homer,"all right, i wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands."
17490,Homer,dad? this photo is a blessing. it eases my pain.
35279,Homer,"yeah, strangling. i mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! right? anyway, i said ""bart""..."
25583,Homer,this flower saved our lives.
27692,Homer,"mm, funky!"
15354,Homer,"mr. plow, that's my name. that name again is mr. plow. our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
28010,Homer,uh... a lighter.
37879,Homer,but what if i want some cooled water?
34042,Homer,"ocean view, obstructed."
35135,Homer,"that's it, boy! i'm eating your yogurt!"
31569,Homer,i don't know what to say.
22917,Homer,"hello, little girl, is your mommy home? you'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy mr. bouncy best-friend."
29915,Homer,"fine, i admit it. help me, ray! appear and strike them down!"
16331,Homer,name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
15134,Homer,oh. that guy.
31194,Homer,you monster! just cut his achilles tendon with this knife.
41536,Homer,really? i thought it was written by losers.
27614,Homer,"oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. only very serious daddy business can tear me from your side."
27960,Homer,"watch your step... don't panic... by going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue."
16973,Homer,i can't let the boy see me skipping work.
15936,Homer,i figure it's some guy's name. some guy named gabbo.
33755,Homer,no time. i'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
31859,Homer,yeah. what have you done with the real moe?
34055,Homer,bonjour.
26441,Homer,i've seen fancier.
14287,Homer,"y'know, son, the day you were born i received the greatest gift a man could have."
18833,Homer,"well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... so to answer your question, i don't know."
21830,Homer,"all right, i'm gonna let you guys in on something. but you've got to keep it much more secret than i did."
18981,Homer,well... what have we here? looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to hullabalooza.
14273,Homer,marge!... marge!...
28081,Homer,so i threw you a fancy banquet / and now you can't stay mad / how 'bout a make-up snuggle? / it would be so rad.
27704,Homer,three coats.
20791,Homer,who the hell is that? some kind of leader?
34013,Homer,help me or kill me!
22884,Homer,"big? daring? lisa, that's it! i've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. step one: steal all the doormats in town."
32443,Homer,i do! i do!
18346,Homer,must hurt self. must hurt self. must hurt self.
22029,Homer,now you're just tryin' to scare me.
32369,Homer,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
22785,Homer,the pie shall be cut in two. then each man shall receive... death. i'll eat the pie.
29571,Homer,go to hell.
38232,Homer,thanks. i still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
19005,Homer,our first job is to entertain...
39814,Homer,"what are you saying, honey?"
31321,Homer,it was either kill him or kill no one!
23517,Homer,get the... get outta... bad animals! go home!
20911,Homer,"steal? oh no, you got the wrong guy."
27354,Homer,"lisa's not gonna want that. oh, what can i get her?"
30005,Homer,lisa sings so sweetly and bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
30058,Homer,left below?! where have i heard that before?
33403,Homer,sweet dreams.
23057,Homer,it's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
25167,Homer,mmm... hug.
38502,Homer,"wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. you're enjoying this, aren't you?"
24701,Homer,okay.
13433,Homer,are you?
19684,Homer,you'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
31811,Homer,"so long, anti-clotting agent!"
16025,Homer,everything is a source of fun...
25211,Homer,"okay, that should do it, moe."
40648,Homer,"come here, boy."
38695,Homer,not you.
21951,Homer,sherbet hoover?
33953,Homer,it will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
35175,Homer,"uh, you look tense. let's discuss this over a cup of grampa's coffee."
40981,Homer,"but marge, i want to see my brother--"
16564,Homer,i dunno. can you swing a sack of door knobs?
37316,Homer,"how do i win marge over? i could get her kids to like me! no, that ship has sailed."
33243,Homer,"ah, interesting. why just the other day i was reading that science is used to make bombs."
40316,Homer,"so that's it. the costume's buried now. as my son would say, i'm one sad ape-like dude."
25865,Homer,i couldn't agree more. perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
33881,Homer,"stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more / by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis... uh, to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow... today's tuesday, so that would make it friday, and then, uh... shakespeare!"
15689,Homer,"oh, shaddup."
17767,Homer,there it is.
20342,Homer,potentially dangerous?
33015,Homer,you know what your problem is? you haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
23438,Homer,"ah, screw it."
33504,Homer,he's nailing something to our door.
35386,Homer,"well, i open a lot of crazy things when i'm drunk, but i don't think so."
15324,Homer,what the... what happ... uh... oh no...
32677,Homer,even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. why can't this be the tunnel of hockey fights?
28270,Homer,"i-m-o--,i-m-o--,1
91096,315,285,homer simpson: --k. get it? ""i am ok."""
35531,Homer,it's best to concentrate on what you do have.
30002,Homer,i think it's staying down. it's staying down! it's not staying down.
27819,Homer,"prove me wrong, silent bob."
21026,Homer,what the--?
27743,Homer,"this is it, boy. with this bird gone, the plant will be mine for the taking."
20724,Homer,"did ya hear that, bart? the carny code. bart, did you hear that?"
24058,Homer,i know. no more being a jerk.
27218,Homer,don't worry. we'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. the time will just fly by.
25978,Homer,for what? a little splattered food never hurt anybody. now everybody shut up and dance!
18085,Homer,"shush, dear, you'll wreck daddy's fun."
24178,Homer,"well, not the unitarians. if that's the one true faith, i'll eat my hat."
29073,Homer,"i'm telling you, i'm the pie man!"
38974,Homer,"well, that's everything i know that girls like."
31860,Homer,"lisa, honey, i bought you something. a dvd!"
17033,Homer,"wait a minute, even lenny is teaching a class. look at the way they admire and adore him."
24608,Homer,that's my number!
17712,Homer,man. it's windy as hell out there.
32964,Homer,aaaaannnnnd done.
21735,Homer,"wait, mine came back."
38941,Homer,no i'm not.
18947,Homer,"now that you're all relaxed... most of us here were born in america. we take this country for granted. but not immigrants like apu. while the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
25120,Homer,"hey, i came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
37506,Homer,"and when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. carl carlson leaves them in the fridge."
14428,Homer,alley balls?
14490,Homer,"yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
13264,Homer,why you little...
31197,Homer,what about with my ears?
19907,Homer,"give me that! bart, this is your father. do you know where the remote is? i looked all over the house."
41351,Homer,"okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--"
32656,Homer,but marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.
24003,Homer,good horse. here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
27266,Homer,"hm, off again. maybe i can hear what's going on."
23360,Homer,but you got to kill...
21679,Homer,milhouse!
34930,Homer,"aloha'oe / aloha'oe... hurry up, kids! we gotta get to the airport!"
27996,Homer,"aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
33575,Homer,"beats me. / i'unno. / please, please, please!"
19247,Homer,"you don't like it, call the cops!"
34228,Homer,here.
35239,Homer,we'll deal with all that later.
35427,Homer,"uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car."
14294,Homer,"oh, sorry."
24683,Homer,this watermelon won't know what hit it.
34322,Homer,"until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
21018,Homer,"gee, thanks guys. this is just like ""the deer hunter."""
40866,Homer,"oh, too bad. it's gonna be a great fight."
16491,Homer,but they're so sweet.
14631,Homer,"lousy chub night. hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
22075,Homer,"yeah, i guess you're right. gimme a hug."
25434,Homer,"oh, my head. how long have i been out here?"
19920,Homer,"oh, i don't know about this dog. he's kinda... snooty."
31011,Homer,"well, you know what a man invented? actual paper."
20250,Homer,you call that prime rib?
15425,Homer,you know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? i've got that right now. ooh... bacon!
37721,Homer,i'm doing it! i'm flying like the squirrel i always knew i was.
33937,Homer,oh marge! i'm ready for some lovin'!
30212,Homer,bingo!
40504,Homer,"shut up, boy."
26850,Homer,"...so i threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
36575,Homer,"oh, like what you see, huh?"
23894,Homer,"oh, i only wanted to show my school spirit."
25990,Homer,you dirty teen.
19338,Homer,"look -- ""mostly madrigals."" hey, that might be good. ooh, ooh, ""an evening with philip glass."" just an evening? ""voices of the elderly poor."""
35205,Homer,dave's not here! dave's not here!
28402,Homer,lookin' good. and i did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
18291,Homer,"hee hee hee. i've got your donut, lard lad! and what are you gonna do about it?"
27537,Homer,"oh, wet and wonderful god, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. surely this has proven whatever point you had."
31071,Homer,oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
23008,Homer,"gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here."
16909,Homer,thank you.
28083,Homer,now i'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
15726,Homer,you name it.
22046,Homer,hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
20380,Homer,"here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
19396,Homer,i engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. now that's psychiatry! eh? eh?
32900,Homer,"oh, this just gets worse and worse."
35043,Homer,"oh, you beautiful man."
28437,Homer,"son, can i have cuts?"
15712,Homer,gulp.
26726,Homer,"oh, i am..."
22537,Homer,ow! prickers! owwww!
23270,Homer,"we don't need no stinkin' ""e"". restaurant review... no. eatery evaluation... no. food box... go or no go? by homer... no. earl. no. bill simpson!"
35380,Homer,that's just what i was going for! i was going for scary.
29549,Homer,a church! maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.
19730,Homer,fifty bucks for a toy? no kid is worth that.
25237,Homer,i can't decide. i throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
32469,Homer,"no, i want you to give me every other surgery you have so i can look good! and can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
35716,Homer,"all right, that's it! forget it! no toys for anyone!"
18181,Homer,"oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
32460,Homer,"welcome home, marge."
38999,Homer,"ha-ha! stupid eagle! it wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! marge! preheat the oven!"
25341,Homer,everybody's been dumped but me. i'm undumpable.
39430,Homer,"marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."
41473,Homer,c'mere!
37529,Homer,there's no such place!
19749,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no..."
30779,Homer,how long is this commercial anyway?
32036,Homer,"hey suckers, check it out. marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery."
16644,Homer,"oh, something stupid like bart would say. bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. something like that."
36070,Homer,ever since the day we met.
37473,Homer,"this is funny, it says here iceland is green, and greenland is icy. the vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
16925,Homer,huh?
30152,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to have a libido!
14254,Homer,"oh, c'mon, honey. you know how it turns out. after all, you wouldn't be here today if i hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
41520,Homer,"marge, i need both hands for this game. can you feed me nachos while i play?"
27708,Homer,wipe me down and sign me up!
34462,Homer,uh listen... can i leave a little early tomorrow? my kid has a thing.
13477,Homer,"good. ""you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
39197,Homer,i'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. they're just playing the game by the rules!
28815,Homer,four jacks.
20213,Homer,"uh-uh. forget it marge. there is no way i am spending my saturdays at a museum. unless... museums don't have foosball, do they?"
18771,Homer,"heh, heh. taft, you old dog..."
19579,Homer,"marge needs help, and god knows, i'm not the man to provide it. but i know who can..."
23920,Homer,"jimmy is such an ugly word, marge. unless you're talking about jimmy smits."
36788,Homer,flushy! go get help!
27934,Homer,/ let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... wind should be coming in from the south... time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
28128,Homer,moe! thank god you saved my baby...
24528,Homer,what?
16634,Homer,that's not a job. it's a waste of time. what can poor people pay ya? nothin'! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? none! who wants to help poor people anyway? nobody!
28043,Homer,you sure love driving.
41222,Homer,don't you get it? you gotta use a reverse psychology.
21790,Homer,"a gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses."
37744,Homer,"everything will be fine... um... oh you, uh, you like movies? this reminds me of that scene in ""alien."""
23110,Homer,oopsie.
29889,Homer,"sorry about that, pal."
15878,Homer,"all right. but if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar."
36663,Homer,"marge, you take that back!"
35216,Homer,"sweetie, don't worry. i'm gonna come back so horny and angry..."
27728,Homer,and now to see mr. burns for the promotion and raise i've deserved since this morning.
17330,Homer,"whew, that's all of 'em. and i'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. how 'bout a present, son?"
38484,Homer,you poor woman. dealing with bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. you rest. i'll be the boy's father now.
36693,Homer,"man, you're making me hot for my dad."
15673,Homer,"forget it, pal!"
35293,Homer,go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
31067,Homer,the heart is the symbol for love.
13636,Homer,"hey, what's so funny?"
34495,Homer,really? me?
16754,Homer,oh.
40636,Homer,"hello, marge? hello? i'm the one who's dying, not you."
28842,Homer,"hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. but you'll have to catch me first!"
36937,Homer,"okay, but i'm a little out of practice."
17764,Homer,get out of there. my family needs to use your bomb shelter.
32991,Homer,"no, it looks cool!"
15239,Homer,"come on, marge. maybe i'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
36284,Homer,"flanders, i don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. i look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws."
17031,Homer,"oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? besides, every time i learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive?"
33233,Homer,disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
36518,Homer,"you're dead, j.j. get yourself buried!"
21326,Homer,"sorry, i only eat food in bar form. when you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, i'm told. that's why i'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
38434,Homer,you pay lenny and carl to be my friends?
21412,Homer,just a little higher...
30823,Homer,"hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!"
17287,Homer,there! better than new! now to take her for a test toast.
17716,Homer,you're pregnant?!
31632,Homer,"i'm gonna get my revenge! and if i get caught, i'm pinning it on the baby like the time i shot mr. burns."
18043,Homer,"so, how was everybody's day at school?"
13718,Homer,yes it is.
26862,Homer,don't worry. you're gonna be just fine. i--
37566,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
14544,Homer,"it's something very special. a home-made bat. it all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when i locked myself out of the house..."
17694,Homer,hi maggie.
21330,Homer,"overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on."
39171,Homer,...and because you can't strangle a girl.
28091,Homer,it's not all his fault. i blame this latchkey kid.
14199,Homer,"marge, you're as pretty as princess leia and as smart as yoda."
18848,Homer,donut?
26659,Homer,"oh, man, i can't believe we spaced on the date."
21819,Homer,"that's right, force it. whip that neck."
17787,Homer,"ooh, i've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
32573,Homer,"hello, i'd like to order a pizza. thirty-five minutes?!"
29810,Homer,what are you dopes lookin' at? you've never seen bling-bling before?
21184,Homer,i guess.
37510,Homer,...keg-pools!
25158,Homer,"deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher."
22693,Homer,"my hat's off to you, red. you're a true american hero. and you did it with style and dignity and... hey, you're not breathing. don't people usually breathe?"
37706,Homer,why are you doing this? wait. are you in love with me?
26845,Homer,that's better.
34371,Homer,that's all that happened? and i got to miss work?
18662,Homer,yoo hoo?
35425,Homer,morning.
30613,Homer,"wow! i've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."
27647,Homer,"look, flanders. i'm always interested in talking about free milk. and if there's cookies involved, so much the better."
29931,Homer,"oh kids, i heart you, too!"
39262,Homer,"ah, son, you don't need all that junk. i'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. hey, i couldn't afford lunch. gimme a bite of that donut."
32453,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. i know just what it'll take to hang onto marge."
39335,Homer,"it could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. lisa, maybe you should try some of this."
23236,Homer,even mine?
22647,Homer,"oh, no you don't. screw that touchy, queery crap! we'll take the harsh antacids. nothing's too good for my little girl."
14299,Homer,do you have any of those microphones left?
28834,Homer,"that's it. from now on i'm not looking forward to anything. oh my god, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! i can't wait!"
38794,Homer,"hey, what the--"
36696,Homer,"dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
15793,Homer,you talk better than you fool.
32221,Homer,what? that's how guys talk.
18874,Homer,"what's wrong, honey?"
16535,Homer,"no, lisa. the only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. i call him gamblor. and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
26682,Homer,"mr. burns, may i field that one?"
37905,Homer,"let me? uh, sweetheart, i downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
33465,Homer,"so, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not."
40040,Homer,"hey, i'm still beating you, boy."
23946,Homer,"they're rebroadcasting major league baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! or so the legend goes."
15171,Homer,"someday you'll thank me for this, son."
30846,Homer,bart! bart!
37078,Homer,wait! what about that couple? they look pretty cozy.
22847,Homer,"wow. it's like marge's dream come true... for me! isn't that great, marge?! for me!"
28826,Homer,can i apply my time toward a future crime?
17134,Homer,cat!... deer!... old man!
15959,Homer,"the next day, we started auditioning for chief wiggum's replacement..."
30978,Homer,oh baby...
34303,Homer,"you still reading that thing? i'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. ever!"
32785,Homer,no!
39577,Homer,"then you've heard. oh, god. what are we doing to do? the lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!"
22420,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to sue the producers of ""policecops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."
36759,Homer,"okay, what else... free tibet! you heard me! free him now! thank you. oh, my luck has changed!"
16622,Homer,it's mine!
22659,Homer,can you pee in it?
18472,Homer,but?
26792,Homer,it's where i got this!
22815,Homer,"yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... why doesn't mine look like that?!"
31948,Homer,don't tell me how to do my job!
34333,Homer,"fine. i was gonna apologize, but now i'm not going to!"
17005,Homer,oh.
32558,Homer,what the hell?
13398,Homer,gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband.
13180,Homer,"hey, the manure dealership is just one of the things i got goin'."
29026,Homer,you've hurt your last feeling!
14970,Homer,is that what i think it is?
23034,Homer,"yes, sir."
26639,Homer,"oh man, this is long. could you read it to me?"
17841,Homer,we left at 1:30 p.m. monday. what time is it now?
27361,Homer,still? then you're not gonna like your other present.
16713,Homer,"marge, that's what i bought it for!"
19638,Homer,"uh, they're just snowmen, mr. burns."
20939,Homer,but i'm in jail.
29672,Homer,"come on kids, we should go. goodbye, selma."
15458,Homer,"oh, i thought that said, ""brain hemorrhages."""
26638,Homer,now you know what i've been goin' through.
36147,Homer,"chief, i believe i have the answer in the back of my car."
28925,Homer,"what are you trying to tell me, skinner?"
38896,Homer,"suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting."
22423,Homer,"dynamic, isn't it?"
27888,Homer,i gotta go.
18018,Homer,"don't worry. we'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
38341,Homer,'bout time!
36337,Homer,we've had stupider!
24850,Homer,good start! now finish the job!
23091,Homer,is the answer japan?
25268,Homer,and how about that stephanie the weather girl?
26855,Homer,"y'ello! hi, mrs. bellamy. no, i'm not doing anything. i can mow your lawn."
20982,Homer,you get it after you leave. now get out of here.
38425,Homer,who are you?
30388,Homer,i'm so itchy!
16444,Homer,uhhh.
27770,Homer,"lisa, i deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce."
15257,Homer,"sorry marge, this is my quest. i'm like that guy -- that spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
28381,Homer,cats!
24838,Homer,uh... i guess i'll take that one.
40759,Homer,my name's homer simpson. i'd like to sign up for something.
29875,Homer,"ray, will you help me fix my roof?"
15043,Homer,now that's not true! you're cute as a bug's ear.
30608,Homer,that flag is mine! don't mess with texas!
15974,Homer,"yeah, but i'm not gonna let it change our lives. i'll be the same loving father i've always been."
32263,Homer,but it's just you and me... that must mean i'm your boss. i'm sick of you! you're fired!
14882,Homer,yeah. i didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
28433,Homer,circle of life.
27014,Homer,and i've never seen you use your tail like that.
30140,Homer,how about this guy?
21258,Homer,woo hoo!
39802,Homer,"one glazed and one scratch-and-win, please."
40637,Homer,nothing. it'll just upset them. i want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
30782,Homer,it's not supposed to.
28839,Homer,and it's a perfect time... i just got fired again.
28421,Homer,that's funny.
39510,Homer,no.
31833,Homer,i got fired from foot locker.
34381,Homer,why you little...
28476,Homer,then whose garter is this?
25983,Homer,yello?
35766,Homer,going up she goes! up she goes!
25145,Homer,"hmm, i'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern..."
16975,Homer,sucker.
17899,Homer,i'll have to trust you on that.
19255,Homer,no problem... can do.
35676,Homer,i'll remind you kids what real fun is!
20239,Homer,"why -- oh, i give up."
23214,Homer,ow!
18479,Homer,any undelivered mail for homer j. simpson?
22786,Homer,"eh, it's not the end of the world."
33729,Homer,"doctor, why is this happening to me?"
29469,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
30783,Homer,blue pants! blue pants!
40025,Homer,what?
15900,Homer,whack! whack! whack!
23756,Homer,maybe you should shut up.
30294,Homer,"now if you'll excuse me, i have to use the outhouse again."
24950,Homer,"gee, i wish i could, son, but we've already left the gift shop."
41395,Homer,i heard you and mommy yelling again last night.
35076,Homer,"but it could use a button. oh, what if i said... well if you..."
39498,Homer,arrrgh!
14261,Homer,marge?
37207,Homer,that's insane! my dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. my gay dad is gay for gays.
27303,Homer,"marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a tuesday."
20691,Homer,"no i don't, i think they're bad / they're fake and phoney and totally wrong."
18379,Homer,thank you for your pity.
30174,Homer,"don't worry, i'll straighten things out with coach clay. we're good buddies. we play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" and he always lets me win!"
28640,Homer,why don't i just pull over?
35440,Homer,"yo, lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
41298,Homer,"okay, homer. this is the moment of truth. you've gotta tell marge you really don't want another kid."
29998,Homer,five ninety-nine?! what a rip-off! someone should shoot you!
31370,Homer,don't forge? don't forge what?
15010,Homer,"wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
23398,Homer,you're right. i gotta let it go. all that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
31528,Homer,what the hell is this thing?
21208,Homer,"uh, it's like the measles. good to get it out of the way."
15078,Homer,i will get you one now!
35471,Homer,"don't panic, son. we can bust up teachy and preachy. here's what we do: i'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother."
19030,Homer,so lame that it's cool?
22317,Homer,really?
35866,Homer,is it snowing down here?
29240,Homer,a slightly colder fridge? in my lifetime? amazing.
30621,Homer,nooooo!
41025,Homer,sort of!
28271,Homer,"ooh boy, casino night! finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six."
27322,Homer,"we know. frank grimes, jr."
37804,Homer,woo hoo! who's chase?
40883,Homer,"marge, we can't be too careful. there are thieves everywhere, and i'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
36599,Homer,"an ""on purpose"" baby?"
15340,Homer,hello... plow king? i was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding widow's peak.
16208,Homer,no.
22406,Homer,"fine. i'll be in the car, driving home."
27327,Homer,which i did.
32761,Homer,"enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend."
23784,Homer,flanders!
13879,Homer,yeah! woo! woo! yeah!
14201,Homer,"oh. well he's always happy. no, wait. he's always mad."
29509,Homer,"oh, i've only got a hundred dollars. i'd better bid shrewdly."
38510,Homer,fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!
28522,Homer,thank god! there's still four more days 'til christmas. i have time to reform my ways!
36150,Homer,"attention, lovers of free office supplies! come and steal things you can easily afford!"
20305,Homer,i don't know.
25920,Homer,i admit it.
23510,Homer,how much?
26019,Homer,'cause moe's a big jerk and a she-male too!
35896,Homer,give me another one!
39173,Homer,"go, go make magic. you just go."
41421,Homer,what kind of afterlife is this? can't even strangle my dead kid.
38930,Homer,"'scuse me, pardon me, what the hell?"
39562,Homer,"in times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. now hop to it, boy!"
34675,Homer,"oh, yeah, yeah, right. uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it."
37567,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
25590,Homer,"so, i notice your home smells of feces."
21598,Homer,my files!
26692,Homer,my father and i were never really close.
25780,Homer,i'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
35671,Homer,"oh no, i don't eat anything new unless i've eaten it before!"
18106,Homer,"i have nothing more to say to you, marge. i'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""i love lucy"" -- you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side."
13255,Homer,uh-oh. uh... i'm pretty sure she was gonna be the next hitler. hello? good deed done.
27571,Homer,"crawling! oh, he's really gone. he's gone!"
26254,Homer,all right. i'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.
27789,Homer,talking won't get you there.
14076,Homer,i didn't even tell you my name.
24193,Homer,"now, over here i've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. it's mostly dristan and holy water, but it does the job."
15996,Homer,i pity the fool who doesn't like... he. and wher's barney?
19262,Homer,do i have to sit up?
30357,Homer,stationary camera.
31326,Homer,wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
29129,Homer,"hey, guys."
40999,Homer,"hello, cook? sorry to bother you so late, but i got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!"
30245,Homer,but the pig!
30815,Homer,it's a lot of little stuff. god has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave saturn?
34567,Homer,of course.
40733,Homer,"hey, don't worry barney. it's a big school. there's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
24364,Homer,"fine. i'll take the next quiz. ""how long will you live?"""
39263,Homer,"i will when mrs. claus's sisters get out of town. thanks for listening, kid."
25652,Homer,"quick, moe! marge cut off my thumb."
24502,Homer,you're almost there.
17279,Homer,fading... rising!
18092,Homer,"all the more reason to hurry up. hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
39630,Homer,don't worry. this is an all-terrain vehicle.
17149,Homer,"all right, pal. where'd you get the sugar for that tea?"
21249,Homer,"well, ray patterson thinks you should do it! animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. did we lose a war? that's not america. that's not even mexico."
21580,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i am.
27414,Homer,it's full of cigarette butts. so is this one...
30349,Homer,"don't worry, he's not showin' up."
16930,Homer,"on the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
21633,Homer,"all week, my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison, but now it's over. i guess i'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father."
26603,Homer,you ain't pretty no more!
22133,Homer,"oh, i get it. you're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?"
40891,Homer,"oooh, thank you, moe! i always wanted one of these."
34679,Homer,oh my god.
14587,Homer,good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
36795,Homer,"this is your miracle? a tree? ooh, look at me. i turn sunlight into complex sugars. big whoop."
32654,Homer,"like all young people, i had a musical dream."
33458,Homer,this counts as that.
20832,Homer,whoops.
28739,Homer,"when a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off."
33493,Homer,...squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...
17292,Homer,stupid bug. you go squish now.
26910,Homer,"interesting. all right, i've come up with a composite sketch of my prime suspect."
39253,Homer,"not a word, marge. i'm heading straight for the tub."
17962,Homer,"exactly. heh, heh."
21363,Homer,hi.
28306,Homer,i still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
32650,Homer,things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
37890,Homer,i wonder what else is chicks?
17669,Homer,okay.
15131,Homer,huh? oh.
14266,Homer,"oh, sure."
15399,Homer,duh.
35324,Homer,let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
33344,Homer,"and you know what else, sweetie? you and your friend princess nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad."
39926,Homer,"the reason i look unhappy is that tonight i have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as i call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
33348,Homer,"the guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's god. well, god doesn't need his own special day!"
39150,Homer,"he's called ""the bachelor."""
29298,Homer,really? frankfurter... is that anything?
34035,Homer,nooooooo!
17011,Homer,now what's that rule?
38194,Homer,i love art!
24722,Homer,"well, that didn't work."
38558,Homer,"well, family, we should be proud. we took on corporate america and broke even."
18567,Homer,"well, you're closing. it's getting late. my kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. there's gotta be some other place we can go. think, moe. think."
17603,Homer,"hey, have you ever noticed that the ""crossing the desert"" is a lot like ""the unblinking eye"" and it's exactly like ""the wreck of the hesperus""?"
29185,Homer,okay.
30435,Homer,no toys!
31007,Homer,or will ever do.
39196,Homer,no! an injustice has gone on here for too long.
14652,Homer,"oooh, there's a good one."
38593,Homer,"no, marge... no! you can't invite a couple of riddlers to stay in the bat cave!"
32729,Homer,"sweetheart, i didn't want to deceive you. i just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes."
33793,Homer,"hey boy, why don't i do that for you?"
39987,Homer,ooops. time for a fill-up. garçon! another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
38287,Homer,i'm sleeping on flanders' couch tonight. ours is crap.
13749,Homer,"here's good news. according to this eye-catching article, sat scores are declining at a slower rate."
23984,Homer,work out!
33654,Homer,won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
34615,Homer,cleaning the gutters?
22007,Homer,f. murray abraham.
29968,Homer,"overeating. and if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. but there won't be time."
14707,Homer,"thanks. you did say sugar, right?"
24412,Homer,perfect.
41486,Homer,why does she get to eat before the reception?
36121,Homer,i'll poke a broom in there! you know i'm capable of it!
21616,Homer,ow!
30727,Homer,you mean fun homer? i'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
17457,Homer,you're home safe. done my duty. see ya the next time we need your signature.
24862,Homer,i can't. my web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
23463,Homer,"aw, what do you know?"
23529,Homer,mindy?
34304,Homer,i got an idea: you can march to selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
19862,Homer,going bowling. not back - avenge deaths.
32119,Homer,i've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say i suck. but it's no use -- i'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
30754,Homer,"you sweet little angel. oh, i'm gonna rip your head off. and spit down your adorable little neck. because i wanna smash your little stupid head. oh, but i love you we'll go on a fishing trip. but first i'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. that's what i'm gonna do!"
31136,Homer,"yes, yes. the game you played so horribly at."
21300,Homer,"yeah, well, i've humiliated my son for the last time. i'm going to get into shape."
36844,Homer,"no, i'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. i never want to see these again."
23798,Homer,take that! woo! woo! h-hey! hey!
33070,Homer,"talk louder? you bet. naturally, i threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. but then lenny said ""no, that was the new chair. that memo was two months old!"" so now i'm sitting on an orange crate. i never felt so--"
32581,Homer,my life is ruined.
31578,Homer,should i hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
29628,Homer,"son, that's the stupidest idea i ever heard. and i know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
16747,Homer,mmmmm. mediciney.
28331,Homer,that's it. i'm acting the way america acts best -- unilaterally.
23567,Homer,"in your face, to-do list!"
23338,Homer,"i know, honey. the important thing is -- run!"
37829,Homer,"marge, i love bart as much as you do but actually not. and that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, i'm going to moe's."
35728,Homer,tween-lit gang-write. but this babar needs a zephyr.
29308,Homer,"c'mon, say something conclusive."
20044,Homer,"marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
36767,Homer,i'm sonny bono. watch out for that tree!
14896,Homer,"marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here."
26507,Homer,"anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. we hope you don't have a horse."
38429,Homer,"see, marge. problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone."
36810,Homer,grampa?!
29611,Homer,hm... where's lenny and carl?
16997,Homer,"great, marge. i wanna hear all about it."
37143,Homer,this calls for decisive action -- like l.b.j.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act.
30974,Homer,hide me!
16482,Homer,"heh, you know, i was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but i think as long as we're not alone together..."
34972,Homer,what's a dime store?
28650,Homer,"cool, an ambulance from the '60s! i bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. injured hippies!"
18856,Homer,"oh, owls, eh? so you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
32940,Homer,"that'll do, brick, that'll do."
22598,Homer,"hey, that's super! see you later."
33612,Homer,"but i ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on expectant mothers drink free night?"
37325,Homer,"i'm planing down that door that always sticks. i put training wheels on bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
26823,Homer,"oh no, not the good cheek!"
32570,Homer,"kids, your mom is with another man, and i need you to help me find out who he is. hm... is this really something i should show you kids?"
16261,Homer,"marge, you can't go out on saturday. that's our special night."
31236,Homer,what's the point? we're all slowly dying.
20568,Homer,you damn well better!
32511,Homer,now?
31726,Homer,"what are you doing here, patty-or-selma?"
22042,Homer,"i love you, dad."
17794,Homer,omigod! he's stealing all the burgers! why you little - i've got you!
14096,Homer,stupid moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
30575,Homer,it's a risk i'll have to take.
24027,Homer,"oh, it is, it is. but we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
13323,Homer,"sleep well, maggie. ah, three for three."
39488,Homer,would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely motorola?
26519,Homer,those were my friends?!
35604,Homer,a woman of stature!
15065,Homer,"nope, that's it."
40172,Homer,"oh, lenore."
14627,Homer,"maybe you're right, marge."
24545,Homer,cloopid blore-apope!
26452,Homer,i'm still not givin' up on buck. there must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
27028,Homer,"manimals, invertebroads! you must fight back against the one who did this to you!"
29091,Homer,"well, that stinks. but i still get to kiss you, right?"
22523,Homer,"hey, look! it's elton john!"
32041,Homer,i don't even have a special tooth problem! this is just a routine check-up! the bib is choking me!
27856,Homer,what a well-kept street. and there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
24477,Homer,it's settled. the stranger stays with us!
26302,Homer,so many previews. so many previews. so many previews.
34386,Homer,"hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do i sign up?"
41231,Homer,swish!
23701,Homer,will you teach me?
16152,Homer,unghhhh!
33933,Homer,it's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
16050,Homer,so you want me to go to college?
19085,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, sir, and i'm gonna get you back to washington before it's too late!"
15749,Homer,"put it in the fridge, moe. i got a date with my wife."
13976,Homer,"what's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
28981,Homer,"we don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
20071,Homer,not very.
38782,Homer,hopin'! hopin'!
16697,Homer,you?
39700,Homer,catch it! catch it!
29912,Homer,ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
16234,Homer,"marge, it's public tv! they never have anything good. where are the geraldos? where are the eubankses-es?"
27806,Homer,aw... my baby's first words.
15760,Homer,you know what i think of this contract?
21420,Homer,"yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it."
14706,Homer,"well, i was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now i feel kinda guilty about it."
32384,Homer,"shh, shh, shh, shh, shh..."
33217,Homer,you sure you're not mad?
33178,Homer,yeah.
33212,Homer,"you know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
28087,Homer,"only teasing. we've flown in the finest busboys from france... i mean, america!"
28042,Homer,"honey, you seem frazzled. why don't you come with us?"
25774,Homer,"well, i'd rather reserve judgement until i... oh my god!"
31098,Homer,"oh, he ain't gettin' married. he has commitment issues!"
15750,Homer,raindrops keep falling on my head...
20458,Homer,"mr. burns, this is homer j. simpson, the father of the big quitter. well, i just wanted to tell you i'm a big quitter, too, and i quit!"
34626,Homer,you're losing me? or you're leaving me?!
26824,Homer,oh.
21216,Homer,you signed my name? i feel so violated.
13971,Homer,"... expiration date: june, 1999... uh, 2012, yeah."
26354,Homer,"oh, i'm so sorry."
17379,Homer,must have rare gummy. distract the salesman marge!
15559,Homer,but i wanna go to duff gardens. right now!
14676,Homer,stupid marge tell me to shut up.
41098,Homer,i got it. the springfield mystery spot.
17484,Homer,i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
28945,Homer,which are you saying is dead? our marriage or our batteries?
36187,Homer,bum-ba-bum-ba / bum-ba-bum-ba...
16657,Homer,woo hoo!
26733,Homer,must suppress rage.
17086,Homer,"good night, marge."
37240,Homer,okay.
21529,Homer,"hey, what the...?"
14034,Homer,leave me alone.
23526,Homer,take it!
24133,Homer,sanctuary!
41282,Homer,wow. that saxophone would make a great pipe.
33917,Homer,this montage sounds really exhausting. how 'bout i just do a walking around sad montage?
31253,Homer,he wants to grind his own corn. maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
27289,Homer,"just fix it, mr. sasswrench."
24868,Homer,beautiful. we have confirmation.
30128,Homer,superman did it.
20049,Homer,"change the channel, marge."
31392,Homer,"man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses."
17400,Homer,"it's okay, they're with me."
28624,Homer,the business of being a dad. can you hand me that magnet?
13741,Homer,"marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
33588,Homer,"sir, i brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar."
27679,Homer,"beat it, waxie."
19230,Homer,it's so unfair. you're everything a dad could hope for.
18428,Homer,"omigod, the plant's gonna explode!"
15445,Homer,not funny.
24912,Homer,"all right, whatever."
21178,Homer,and so on.
18556,Homer,what are you doing to my son?!!
40237,Homer,"look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. it's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. and i never want that to happen to me."
27773,Homer,"hey! that's a printer port, not a finger hole."
31010,Homer,they're gonna divide the school in two?
37840,Homer,let me handle things. just go upstairs and shut the door. there are some things only a boy should see.
21747,Homer,"it made me angry, jerry. angry and tired."
40730,Homer,"english! who needs that? i'm never going to england. come on, let's go smoke."
23913,Homer,wasteful and practical.
27926,Homer,"you people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. if i get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
38734,Homer,"beautiful music, baby."
36514,Homer,"i was thinking about you. it's your birthday in like three, four months? would it be weird if i threw you a party?"
28094,Homer,five-h?
22000,Homer,i'm done.
32624,Homer,"hmm... ""dispose of proper--"" this book is too hard."
34848,Homer,what time monday?
22099,Homer,the pig is in the poke.
21627,Homer,"in the olden times, if you were watching tv and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. it was the hardest thing in the world to do. but now, with the lazy man reclining toilet chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip."
37288,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'.
21276,Homer,"look at that beautiful garbage! other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
20061,Homer,"okay. now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --"
25963,Homer,"you callin' me a liar, carl?"
18003,Homer,"no, no, let me finish. i just want you to know i've always been proud of you. you're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. you helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. but you're also my daughter, and i don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
22530,Homer,"we're putting an end to your insane valentine's rampage. never again will good, lazy men have to... what the--?"
18005,Homer,"aw, no..."
37858,Homer,"oh, i don't know. it won't seem like christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in january."
15778,Homer,which way to the bathroom?
36332,Homer,"marge, there're so many mysteries that i need to have solved."
36016,Homer,thanks for reading it to me.
17382,Homer,"see you in hell, candy boys."
25301,Homer,"no. no, no, no. you're my partner."
17208,Homer,shark-boy!
36240,Homer,"mr. burns, before i leave, i've got a few things to get off my chest: one: i liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". you don't have to know how long. two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? you know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. so to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
13530,Homer,you! you did this to me!
18443,Homer,woo hoo!
30049,Homer,"i always was, honey. look. cameron's about to sing the song i wrote for him. he's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
20098,Homer,"anyhow, i must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing i knew, i was running for my life."
30716,Homer,teach me that the stove is hot.
33753,Homer,"oh my god, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. way to go, marge!"
19751,Homer,"how'd it go? tell me everything that happened! he didn't give you gay, did he? did he?"
16244,Homer,"phht, that's just an old wives tale."
36910,Homer,i'm gonna get a snack. but first... should i introduce the black plague? what could be the harm?
24314,Homer,i don't wanna talk about it!
32658,Homer,"i was so depressed, i spent all my time in a bar."
19487,Homer,"a machine? earl's a machine. oh, that's just perfect! homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! oh, wow!"
29281,Homer,"uh-um... what do you think ""some"" is?"
39876,Homer,"i'm gonna miss you, son. and listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. i guess what i'm saying is, don't mess up france the way you messed up your room."
35433,Homer,or maybe i just found them on the ground.
34280,Homer,hm...
28160,Homer,death? we don't want any.
36421,Homer,"you're right, marge. i lied."
21464,Homer,"sorry, guys. marge and i are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast."
37558,Homer,you deserve what you get...
17114,Homer,"yes, lisa?"
16372,Homer,"you're right, marge. good work, boy."
39547,Homer,"all right. hey, hey!"
30472,Homer,"negatively, i assume."
17271,Homer,can't murder now. eating.
41061,Homer,"okay, flanders, you're the boss. heh, heh, heh."
20680,Homer,"oh, i got it! oh, it's just a thread! it was... she's got... she's got the washcloth!"
27630,Homer,damn right honey. you're number one on my menu. now super-size it!
15638,Homer,what's the matter?
37287,Homer,"son, if there's one thing i've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! it's so frickin' boring! run, boy! i'll create a distraction!"
16155,Homer,"maggie, i'm trying to watch tv. put that moldy old bear down."
31641,Homer,you don't frighten me!
38430,Homer,you gave away ice cream?!
19864,Homer,"yeah, suck like a fox!"
31340,Homer,everyone got an assignment but us.
38814,Homer,... ooh!... ...
13611,Homer,"that reminds me! ""seven ways to spice up your marriage."""
32449,Homer,what's your secret?
17805,Homer,oh no.
37239,Homer,are your kids gonna be there?
34738,Homer,"good afternoon. i'd like to return this merchandise. wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain."
36114,Homer,"why you little... i'm gonna get... no, homer. you can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. juries hate that. so instead, boy, i want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
19491,Homer,"well, i won't be lonely for long...."
20427,Homer,my father never believed in me.
38493,Homer,"uh, works for me."
27629,Homer,"daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
19154,Homer,"say, what's going on?"
29849,Homer,"marge, i thought you'd never take me back after what i did to krusty."
22907,Homer,"they picked springy! in your face, patty and selma!"
15412,Homer,"please, please, please, please, please..."
15193,Homer,"hand me my patching trowel, boy."
32047,Homer,"what the hell is a ""fundae""?"
24851,Homer,$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
32986,Homer,and you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
34793,Homer,looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
37278,Homer,"to elaborate, i want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of lisa's substitute..."
22741,Homer,all right.
20613,Homer,"kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
35262,Homer,"aw, come on, sourpuss. tickle tickle!"
31841,Homer,hand ball! direct kick!
25091,Homer,kids.
27639,Homer,sara sloane? the movie star?
39086,Homer,"marge, kids! tonight was a turning point in my life."
34040,Homer,"leave me alone, you two!"
29565,Homer,"where's the remote! this is not a drill, people!"
24818,Homer,"i'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. is this enough dirty, dirty money?"
34191,Homer,"oooh, what a lucky man..."
30637,Homer,sideshow bob!
16662,Homer,"oh, that i'll wear."
17367,Homer,"you like sweets, kids? i know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. in this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. you'd spit them out! you would! i'm talking about the candy industry trade show. ."
13739,Homer,"hee hee, hee-hee-hee! read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
18071,Homer,woo hoo! easy money!
14746,Homer,"just so i don't wonder... you would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
37836,Homer,yes. what's skinner's weakness?
40689,Homer,"you gotta help me, barney. i'm in jail."
29793,Homer,"stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. everyone gets a prison job but me. all my best friends are guards. they think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
38097,Homer,"you're right. bad idea, bad idea... should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? bad idea, bad."
26556,Homer,how did i get here?
24934,Homer,huh?
18328,Homer,"um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""tron""?"
17650,Homer,"you know, marge you're right. the simpson family is the best possible club i could belong to."
29449,Homer,"see you in hell, document!"
22221,Homer,"oh, yeah. two more of these, please."
39317,Homer,"wait a minute, you little cheater. you're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
15492,Homer,cloud goes up. cloud goes down. cloud goes up. cloud goes down...
23507,Homer,okay.
38841,Homer,what the? this isn't halloween!
31043,Homer,jogging?
29276,Homer,uh-oh.
21766,Homer,"ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me."
17095,Homer,"okay, thirty."
31411,Homer,"one butter-crusted choco-rocket, please."
30691,Homer,"marge, i found my real father! his name is mason fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""homer, please do that in the loo."""
24166,Homer,"really? without tv, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends."
32553,Homer,remembrance of things fast?
13475,Homer,"i promised my boy one simple thing: lots of riches. and that man broke my promise. well, i've had it! bart, take a letter."
22175,Homer,"all right, bart!"
28274,Homer,woo-hoo! woo-hoo!
32632,Homer,i live in that place!
29040,Homer,dammit!
24762,Homer,fine. you want passion? i'll give you passion.
21196,Homer,i don't know. a lot of people were yelling stuff.
15186,Homer,"yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
27016,Homer,gotta find a way to change marge back. and replace the m&ms i took from the mini bar.
22720,Homer,no problem. i'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
31644,Homer,avenge me. in flamboyant impractical fashion.
41300,Homer,"uh-oh. she's picked names? who puts this much thought into having a baby? stall, stall, stall!"
20469,Homer,"hold on, i'm workin' it out."
26606,Homer,"i'm sure he'll turn up. look, here's one of his buttons."
35770,Homer,"well, in that case..."
19223,Homer,"wow, that's really lazy."
24494,Homer,"""my funny family,"" take one."
27718,Homer,"listen up, ""life obstacles."" from now on, nothing's gonna stand in homer simpson's way!"
14245,Homer,"... and when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold."
15631,Homer,"son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now."
29584,Homer,y'ello?
20864,Homer,"well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
36748,Homer,"marge, in a crisis like this, i need time for quiet contemplation."
33362,Homer,why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
32949,Homer,"son... all hobbies suck. but if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time."
38000,Homer,ow!
20910,Homer,"if you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car."
30210,Homer,bingo? that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
40135,Homer,i don't know.
38956,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
29074,Homer,"yeah. let's go home, honey."
16351,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
41031,Homer,"and sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. there's got to be something you can do about that."
32687,Homer,wanna take a ride with your old man?
40446,Homer,"you know marge, we're great parents!"
38319,Homer,"marge is right. i'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now."
27086,Homer,mr. seltzer?
39827,Homer,"uh... mr. burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, i'm no lover-boy."
37704,Homer,"did you just fart, sir."
22890,Homer,"now, step three..."
17893,Homer,hunh?

32952,Homer,this is the first book i've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
26191,Homer,"me. / right here. / oh, me too. / please."
30623,Homer,"hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"

14003,Homer,"oh, how i envy you!"
19076,Homer,oh no. aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... oh my god! lyndon larouche was right!
30824,Homer,woo hoo! i won!
40797,Homer,"i'll take that as a compliment. so, will you go out with me? please say oui."
17530,Homer,i'm sure it's nothing.
13238,Homer,i heard lenny had a terrible fall.
30042,Homer,"oh god! oh, they're delicious! oh, so happy! oh god, they're... they're gone."
21932,Homer,"well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!"
35577,Homer,"the least i can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. it's kind of my way of sending a christmas card. happy holidays, everyone! family's fine!"
38727,Homer,"oh, i don't have what it takes to play guitar. i mean, i'm no joe walsh in the brains department."
29263,Homer,i was thinking of chicken wings.
38049,Homer,"seriously, do you have my money?"
40858,Homer,"well, thank you honey."
20422,Homer,wipe that smile off your face.
24149,Homer,"does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""jet-laggg""."
41233,Homer,pick up bart! pick up bart!
41375,Homer,i mean it's christmas...
20783,Homer,"it's free, right?"
19379,Homer,"he fell for it! way to go, marge!"
14901,Homer,"she, uh... good for her."
23783,Homer,don't hurt me! here's my wallet.
14866,Homer,"well, when is he gonna act like it?"
16249,Homer,hello? can i get some help? snack related mishap!
38268,Homer,help me guys! guys?
13233,Homer,"at the end of a hard day, there's no better feeling than comin' home to the people you love."
20736,Homer,"hey, there's a sucker."
15755,Homer,then i got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
30765,Homer,stupid horse! it's a deer crossing!
23849,Homer,so much.
23968,Homer,that was my plan all along. now relax and the currents will take us home.
41331,Homer,go ahead! give in! beer! beer!
28952,Homer,and a one and a two and a...
14443,Homer,"well, okay. but you have to swear you're comin' back."
13198,Homer,this pays a lot better than you think.
33277,Homer,ow! my finger!
36572,Homer,now you're sure i bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?
38472,Homer,"oh lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. why i could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. that's why i never plan more than four seconds ahead."
31688,Homer,i got the idea from the regular pen.
15664,Homer,"step on his neck, and run like hell."
24427,Homer,"yep, this place is great. and someday, when lisa and bart get married, it'll all be theirs."
15303,Homer,hmmm.
21651,Homer,"look, son. edison was just like me."
34348,Homer,"i love watching you knit. it reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
33284,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
35332,Homer,the real magic is raising three kids in this economy! you can put the ball back now.
31055,Homer,"yes, now you do."
31850,Homer,yellow card!
31566,Homer,here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.
30364,Homer,"marge, we owe her the truth!"
13299,Homer,and?
36532,Homer,"you've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. after that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. i'll get us some ice cream."
37305,Homer,"you can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us."""
31121,Homer,"oh wait, it was a twist-off."
27109,Homer,but i like it...
38445,Homer,"giuseppe, i want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
14424,Homer,it's beautiful.
36691,Homer,holy moly.
34417,Homer,ned's run off into the desert!
38339,Homer,"son, can you put me in 3-d for a second?"
32069,Homer,woo hoo!
19138,Homer,yes.
24076,Homer,"okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of flanders paying his bills..."
27744,Homer,mr. burns! the nuclear regulatory commission is here for a surprise inspection!
13789,Homer,all right.
23843,Homer,that's me!
22413,Homer,"yeah. ""bart."""
20161,Homer,and why are the kids here?
38163,Homer,it's kinder never to tell them.
22079,Homer,"well, i'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial."
30773,Homer,ow! my ass!
17561,Homer,that's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
39088,Homer,"they taught me that i don't need to lose weight, i should just be proud of what i am."
39774,Homer,for marge?
23724,Homer,done.
32367,Homer,"oh, that was so hot! i love watching you do other guys!"
17765,Homer,no deal. out.
18194,Homer,communication. gotcha.
37168,Homer,where does it say that?
39073,Homer,this is it.
13743,Homer,"wait till i get you home, boy."
15225,Homer,"well, i won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks i'm lazy. i'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... eh, goodnight."
30767,Homer,"son, i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago... taking you to vegas!"
20889,Homer,don't you hate pants?
35406,Homer,right.
30281,Homer,"hello, marge?"
19681,Homer,you've changed me as well. i'm no longer the money-driven workaholic i once was.
40470,Homer,"bart, bart. we're home, son."
18665,Homer,he's not lost.
37948,Homer,"man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
21173,Homer,can he get a duck?
19992,Homer,"no, run around in circles!"
15316,Homer,"well, john q driveway has our number. now we play the waiting game."
13438,Homer,are you?
27179,Homer,"aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. well..."
37129,Homer,i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
27585,Homer,sure. my son is bart simpson and...
27245,Homer,"oh, i wish you would reconsider the proposal of hiram beatwife."
17896,Homer,request permission to slink by.
26303,Homer,start the movie!
29756,Homer,"boy, i wouldn't mind driving that to the holland, michigan tulip festival."
40017,Homer,"what! you did! well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! lisa, hand me your paper."
29013,Homer,do i ever!
33885,Homer,who the hell is banquo?
30829,Homer,i heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
20830,Homer,"i'm glad i'm back! because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, i was born again!"
32929,Homer,show me the law that says i can't! wheee!
19879,Homer,i said forty-two!
29533,Homer,"welcome to the ""homer simpson showboating academy."""
36664,Homer,you take that back!
26557,Homer,the one i didn't make and marge didn't make and bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
16080,Homer,do we have to?
37764,Homer,"wow, i'd love to help, but i did kind of have plans for tonight..."
21127,Homer,"uh, i'm homer simpson, your trusted employee."
19818,Homer,lisa too?
32477,Homer,"i sure have. plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. when it is, everyone should get it."
39575,Homer,"oh, no, marge!"
17842,Homer,"hey, are you like one of those english guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
29246,Homer,"a contractor? those guys are the biggest crooks around. they charge for materials and labor! pick one, jerks!"
37144,Homer,"the same way hollywood does, by watching british movies!"
18130,Homer,that tree's been in springfield since the time of our forefathers. give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
26563,Homer,how many people live in brazil?
31204,Homer,i've never seen him happier.
39889,Homer,aww. you called me dad.
15386,Homer,what? what?
25106,Homer,"all right, first item: i lost our life savings in the stock market. now, let's move on to the real issue: lisa's hogging of the maple syrup."
41519,Homer,"marge, come here."
38907,Homer,"set a course, mr. maggie. anywhere but home."
33068,Homer,human garbage can to the rescue!
28486,Homer,oh c'mon... mr. burns is way more selfish.
32646,Homer,"oh, the patriot act is so terrible! the government might find out what library books i take out. what's next -- finding out what operas i go to?"
32673,Homer,what if i told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
14947,Homer,"oh, stupid itchy church pants..."
21024,Homer,"no way, man! my hair is who i am!"
30933,Homer,i'll miss you kids too.
13517,Homer,"mr. burns, you brought us a present."
27404,Homer,"hello, this is a phone survey. if the election were held today, would you vote for ""a"" the cops are there, or ""b"" you are free to talk?"
19197,Homer,"uh, sure."
22332,Homer,c'mon!...
24681,Homer,pinball wizard!
31524,Homer,yes we are.
31217,Homer,and then today at lunch lenny and i went to the park and rented a rowboat. carl sketched us from the bank. summer days.
21214,Homer,"this is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. your father, me, beat city hall. it's just like david and goliath, only this time david won."
28291,Homer,"squeak, squeak, squeak. no, don't kiss me."
39533,Homer,and there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
24769,Homer,i'm on board.
17354,Homer,"fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
24713,Homer,"maybe so, but dawson's gonna be bummed."
16420,Homer,gotta go.
20464,Homer,"hello, son."
25981,Homer,oh! whoa! hemorrhage-amundo!
24210,Homer,looking for these? dee-dee-dee.
15260,Homer,fine. i'll look it up.
22563,Homer,"aw, please come in. maggie smells bad. and the cat wants something, but i don't know what."
18899,Homer,where are you two going at this hour?
24177,Homer,"yes, lisa junior?"
35067,Homer,bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but i didn't think it was the right thing to do.
39727,Homer,i knew it all along.
21512,Homer,looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
30565,Homer,i still feel it. it's so itchy. itchy...
18973,Homer,"but most of all, i remember the music."
23275,Homer,still not clean! stink of failure still on me!
25602,Homer,"now he's just a stinking flight attendant! hey, where's my pillow?"
13258,Homer,"bart, help! sonnn!"
17489,Homer,dad wasn't even around on christmas morning when i actually got to meet santa claus. some father... wait a minute.
41443,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to make fun of my socks...
13360,Homer,i admit it. i didn't know when to say when. i'm sorry it happened and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
30573,Homer,"oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. there's, uh... lisa and...the stove."
39927,Homer,"sorry, pal..."
28661,Homer,"where to, mack?"
16330,Homer,"okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. but you know what? at least i'm out there trying new things. if it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
37441,Homer,what the--? change the channel? but i'm watching soft-core tennis!
37950,Homer,bart! your comic vendor's here!
35928,Homer,"great show, people. great show. um... not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? not a big deal."
15413,Homer,"can you say ""daddy""?"
29335,Homer,ladies! there's no need to fight over me.
20382,Homer,i use it for everything! watch me turn on the tv.
14102,Homer,"fools! you poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your flaming moe's. all the time wondering, ""how does he do it?"" well, i'm going tell you. the secret ingredient is..."
21952,Homer,ooooh.
15522,Homer,what's it to ya?
25826,Homer,"ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves."
27283,Homer,i'm a people person. who drinks.
31268,Homer,"to daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day."
15845,Homer,"why, you little --"
26842,Homer,"uh, they discontinued the cobbler."
29456,Homer,"oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
22811,Homer,you gotta build fast! cement drying!
34803,Homer,"okay, okay. if you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
13206,Homer,"when i grow up, i'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. how many wishes do i have left?"
27274,Homer,"wait a minute, i'm not wearing a shirt!"
39662,Homer,"no. this is a trap. it's going to catch us our dinner. come on, boy."
31674,Homer,did she mention she was knocked up?
19090,Homer,don't blame me. i voted for kodos.
32572,Homer,really? then if i created all this... that means i can have pizza anytime i want!
13254,Homer,"hey, stop squirming!"
22957,Homer,"you see white people have names like ""lenny,"" whereas, black people have names like ""carl."""
32025,Homer,"all right, everybody. squeeze in real tight."
25213,Homer,we might be able to do business.
24127,Homer,"uh, why, no. uh... everything is just..."
15851,Homer,"marge, i ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
28768,Homer,the school sent this dealy over for maggie. his name is phonic frog.
21466,Homer,"now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
34909,Homer,"well, bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
27732,Homer,"ahhh, look at the little eels. electric eels!"
17520,Homer,"uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, i'm gonna let you do most of the work. i think you're ready for it, alan."
25125,Homer,"dr. joyce brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect."
25128,Homer,"everything from hop on pop to death be not proud. it's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop."
37652,Homer,"those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. now, the toast..."
19208,Homer,but you stopped the fight. won't everyone be mad at you?
32396,Homer,of course i know!
17120,Homer,"don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer."
25899,Homer,it's about time. oh.
30164,Homer,"ned, i had no choice. it was just so funny!"
27779,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. thank you for... huh?"
29545,Homer,every single super bowl halftime show has been great.
16702,Homer,"apu, if it'll make you feel any better, i've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish flanders was dead."
27339,Homer,purple rain!
20768,Homer,"yeah, i guess your old man is smarter than you thought."
31318,Homer,burn everything!
39143,Homer,"okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
35677,Homer,and i've got tickets for the grand opening saturday night!
15668,Homer,"what a nice idea, son. it's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. i'll just go get it."
30285,Homer,rugged? is that the same as handsome?
36650,Homer,what the--? i'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
25455,Homer,stop that!
39291,Homer,"don't you believe in me, son?"
14610,Homer,"dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
27975,Homer,why you little...!
33671,Homer,not even heated up. typical dog.
36166,Homer,"now, i'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. but just to make sure..."
22303,Homer,perfect.
14984,Homer,i can wait all --
35150,Homer,"""family, today i graduate from my anger management class."""
39399,Homer,proud. proud of what?
40267,Homer,"as i got up in front of them, i felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. it was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."
26021,Homer,"it's the family bar. right, kids?"
14448,Homer,good bye? where's my clean underwear?
18793,Homer,no.
20775,Homer,"this, bart, is a crazy man."
20257,Homer,and the rest.
24419,Homer,that's perfect! we can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
35514,Homer,"well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
31836,Homer,i'm open! i'm open!

29423,Homer,drugs! various drugs! be sure to read instructions! uh-oh! where'd i put the instructions?
39634,Homer,"well, here we are!"
16229,Homer,"oh, sorry."

17968,Homer,"good idea, marge. my mind is going a mile a minute."
23000,Homer,"oh, that's great, honey. you tell me everything you can before the commercial's over."
18281,Homer,rock stars. is there anything they don't know?
37026,Homer,"this could come in handy. but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home. dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
35732,Homer,the caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.

20082,Homer,"well, bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?"
36768,Homer,"so, which do you prefer, m'lady? tom selleck, rollie fingers or pringles man?"
18333,Homer,"piece of cake, son!"

14136,Homer,what? i sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
17034,Homer,"that's it! if he can teach a class, he can teach a class. i mean, i can teach a class."
23497,Homer,and there's some more!

31032,Homer,"okay weingartens, what else is in your mail?"
24628,Homer,"i reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
38005,Homer,monitors?!
39240,Homer,so?
35354,Homer,"yeah, that's his thing. anyway, fat tony and i think this is a chance to patch things up between you and selma. plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
13650,Homer,"stupid flanders... always showing off. go ahead, marge, have a ball... what if they game back and i was dead from not eating? they'd cry their eyes out. we should have never gone to the flanders'. oh, why did we go to the flanders' house and leave homer all alone with no food. and i'd be laughing. laughing from my grave."
32734,Homer,"well, that's our book for the year -- i think we've earned some tv."
36530,Homer,much better.
18762,Homer,no! nooooooo!!
31425,Homer,"son, i will not stand for intolerance!"
24157,Homer,"craig and amy, craig and amy. why don't you just marry craig and amy?"
16336,Homer,and that sends me into a shame spiral.
15471,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best... aw, forget it."
22960,Homer,"oh, yeah! and i'm not easily impressed. wow! a blue car!"
29470,Homer,"but i don't wanna take care of the kids... um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? bart sleeps in the microwave, right?"
38706,Homer,"once again, i've been saved from any consequences. it'll keep happening till one day i create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. thanks, boy."
16945,Homer,"huh? oh, right. so i guess you're in okay shape, huh? no heart problems or anything..."
35648,Homer,hug! hug! hug!
26015,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious. i'm turning our garage into a tavern. the kind moe's used to be.
36442,Homer,what's that a reference to?
14503,Homer,"oh come on now, flanders, i don't complain about your your... moustache."
22922,Homer,"don't answer yet. watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of god's greatest creation, the spring."
36200,Homer,"oh death, you're a lifesaver!"
21665,Homer,"look at me, bart! i'm driving!"
31452,Homer,"marge, let me explain: i had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
13394,Homer,would this be a good time to be honest?
15200,Homer,did you see the bubble?
28966,Homer,can i have both?
29010,Homer,"oh, you're on my hair. oh, that's better."
13819,Homer,"marge, don't flake out on me. that monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
34328,Homer,oh yeah? well .
15707,Homer,mmmm... gummi beer.
26614,Homer,"we'll get to that. right now, i think we need some time apart--"
23162,Homer,those movies sucked. i only saw 'em to get marge into the sack. ps: mission accomplished.
39637,Homer,"yes sir! this is a real adventure. why, i bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this."
28267,Homer,your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. but at least now i'll never lose you again.
26314,Homer,i learned so much about my family. you'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
15997,Homer,then came the day we knew we were finished.
34118,Homer,do you guys know funky town?
25576,Homer,leeches!
24555,Homer,woo hoo!
37958,Homer,"you're kumiko's father? welcome, sensei!"
17519,Homer,"but, i keep tellin' ya, i'm not a pilot."
17245,Homer,"nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. now, i'm not very political -- i usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this birch barlow really speaks to me..."
37111,Homer,"well, i'm glad someone has."
37405,Homer,the woman i love!
31092,Homer,and her.
18706,Homer,how - can - that - old - man - hit - so - far?!!
40139,Homer,"okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one."
25607,Homer,"aw, he loves beer."
13351,Homer,marge!
28872,Homer,"but you do believe it, right?"
24322,Homer,that i will.
18905,Homer,now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
40550,Homer,"you don't have to do that, mr. burns. i can throw myself out."
24709,Homer,my uncle still has my nose.
36095,Homer,yeah.
40286,Homer,phfft. you'll make new and better friends.
32282,Homer,"i've got tow dough i'm lookin' to blow, moe!"
30964,Homer,"silence! now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant."
19876,Homer,"sorry, i'm all out. wha-- how about some turpentine? or caulk? delicious caulk..."
18883,Homer,forget the name homer simpson. have it sent care of... langdon alger.
36896,Homer,"well, if i've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore."
25599,Homer,what a nice lady.
26187,Homer,"well, not with that temper."
25871,Homer,"oh, this punishment is so cruel."
33437,Homer,uninsured! uninsured!
13365,Homer,"oh, well, it's very tempting. really a wonderful idea."
40455,Homer,"eight o'clock, but what does it matter?"
16269,Homer,i can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
16995,Homer,souvenir.
18049,Homer,"kids are so naïve. lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""do not feed the bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
16582,Homer,return to your homes and places of businesses!
36634,Homer,this is the worst pain imaginable!
34520,Homer,flanders! wake up! take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.
24697,Homer,"oh lisa, this must be a rough time for you. do you have any friends or family you can stay with?"
29354,Homer,yeah. nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
17397,Homer,"well, that's kind of a gray area."
32971,Homer,"okay, i've set my trap. now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. condos! affordable condos! bail-jumpers welcome!"
13821,Homer,now you're talkin'!
20392,Homer,"oh, honey, please come home. i need you. it's dark in the house and i'm hungry and lonesome. and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
21198,Homer,"good news, everyone. i got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service."
38704,Homer,"you know, alarm code three six seven nine. three six seven nine!"
23180,Homer,"oh, wait. there they are."
32398,Homer,"is ""beautiful"" a color?"
23648,Homer,"hey, apu, manjula. you guys are still married?"
35916,Homer,"oh yeah, that's right. it's already happening, people. hoard your toilet paper! shoot the mailman! shoot the mailman!"
21336,Homer,huh?... wha ya?... hey! you guys are dragging me up the mountain.
21156,Homer,god bless america!
23356,Homer,"oh, wait... what i'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
29752,Homer,i've got gameboys and caramel apples!
25620,Homer,"okay boy, drop the thumb..."
32098,Homer,i came to relax -- you think of it!
17275,Homer,"i'm mike wallace. i'm morley safer. and i'm ed bradley. all this and andy rooney tonight on ""60 minutes."""
26672,Homer,y'ello.
40162,Homer,"oooh, thanks."
16424,Homer,"so uh, what do you guys think of mindy?"
40832,Homer,i want free cable.
14368,Homer,"you'd think that wouldn't you. but you see lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. even though they say it's okay in the bible."
25881,Homer,"i'm with you, son!"
22384,Homer,this is better.
39942,Homer,"sorry, son. you'll understand one day."
19215,Homer,can't they get a pole for that sign?
33306,Homer,"they're just drones, lisa. they only live for like five minutes anyway. and they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and bart."
32197,Homer,"oh, oh, i just have one question: what is this movie about?"
18786,Homer,"here are your messages: ""you have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""you have 10 minutes,"" ""your car has been impounded,"" ""your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""you have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
38217,Homer,oh yeah. that's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
31610,Homer,"oh sorry, i wasn't listening. i was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. lookin' good."
31880,Homer,"but it did happen. just yesterday, in crazytown."
26583,Homer,"but you're on vacation, honey. i'm not wearing my wedding ring!"
39598,Homer,what?
29327,Homer,it's a conversation starter!
15167,Homer,don't point that thing at me. i said you're not going to the movie and i'm sticking to it.
36676,Homer,my dad was an aspiring songwriter like charles manson? i never knew that.
20287,Homer,"so then lenny says, ""as if! don't even go there, sister."""
35840,Homer,"good one, boy."
28097,Homer,i'll do it!
29607,Homer,"...and do you, julio, take thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in massachusetts and vermont... maybe canada... stay outta texas... as long as you both are gay?"
34292,Homer,how's this for a date night?
19008,Homer,woo hoo!
29861,Homer,so why didn't you invite me?
21251,Homer,who should handle all your dirty jobs?
22550,Homer,"and that's it, right?"
27239,Homer,maybe i could wuther your heights?
15658,Homer,"thanks, son."
35073,Homer,"son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work."
33947,Homer,that could work.
31085,Homer,"the wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet."
19720,Homer,"yes. i certainly do. hello there, itchy. i know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish i would go away, but i think we got off on the wrong foot. i know i can come off a little proactive, and for that i'm sorry. but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, i know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
29811,Homer,how come nobody told me before?
14757,Homer,hear hear!.
29729,Homer,"none. no wait, three. since the last one, i don't remember so good."
35867,Homer,"if those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe i can forgive..."
20157,Homer,"okay, once more. where are we going?"
39186,Homer,i'm comin' for ya baby!
31638,Homer,you? you're too dumb to tell a story.
25491,Homer,we don't need your high-priced safety junk!
40592,Homer,"yum. i've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, lisa."
37504,Homer,but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson...
36098,Homer,apu! what are you doing out of your natural habitat?
32309,Homer,maggie!
21135,Homer,"no you don't. heh, heh."
38834,Homer,woo hoo!
30781,Homer,"it's called ""headvertising."" it creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
21174,Homer,come on. come to poppa.
19588,Homer,"you mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? oh, fat tony... i will say good day to you, sir."
36983,Homer,"hollywood has taught you well, my son. now let's push ""play."""
29353,Homer,you broke in!
33606,Homer,"moe, you were right!"
25673,Homer,"say bye, mr. flanders."
19643,Homer,"marge, kids."
24006,Homer,he ran all the way here.
26497,Homer,only in public.
21994,Homer,"relax, she just needs a little lovin'."
25713,Homer,mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
32880,Homer,why would a robber make pie?
37864,Homer,the secret is don't read the comment cards.
36675,Homer,wait a minute!
36698,Homer,"and i don't think you're boring. it's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. look at sunday night. there's like eight amazing shows. none of them on fox."
13944,Homer,"heh heh, the perfect crime."
36373,Homer,can i put my hand through you?
30187,Homer,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. oh, ned, i don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?"
20303,Homer,"c'mon, give us some candy. don't pretend you're not home!"
25048,Homer,circus?
24407,Homer,let's go!
31252,Homer,"look, i'm sorry you're upset. but if we tell the truth now, i'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. then you won't be married to a man. you'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the florida keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. you don't want that."
40675,Homer,papa!
37367,Homer,"ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!"
25927,Homer,easy... easy...
16732,Homer,i can't! i can't!
22797,Homer,can you?
17761,Homer,"okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
39255,Homer,"yeah, well, merry christmas."
22548,Homer,"hey, a red one! can i buy that? please?"
15449,Homer,"woo hoo, look at that blubber fly."
16750,Homer,"congratulations, barney."
16748,Homer,"ahem... i uh... don't think this contest is over yet, buzz. if that is your real name. i believe there is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
17026,Homer,"so, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. as usual, i'm winning and not realizing it. and lenny says that i'm uh... get this... ""a little slow."""
37439,Homer,"oh marge, when you hold me like that..."
31759,Homer,this ends now!
37514,Homer,"you have a great day, ma'am."
32187,Homer,"well, you're always telling me i should eat more dirt."
38068,Homer,fine! but the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
17145,Homer,"in america, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
13364,Homer,hmmmm.
14750,Homer,is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
35070,Homer,"well, in season two, when sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward."
34764,Homer,"man, it's been a crazy morning. champagne?"
22495,Homer,"mornin', apu. still in hot water with the squaw?"
33368,Homer,that's not why i'm here. get dressed.
22777,Homer,"don't say that! maybe i can sneak you back in. i mean, god can't be everywhere at once, right?"
13731,Homer,... bart! have you started smoking?
25065,Homer,"yeah, as a tribute to princess di. and dodi. because these days, princesses..."
32067,Homer,what a great show: real people with real problems!
17309,Homer,don't touch anything?!! i'll... touch... whatever... i... feel like!!
20187,Homer,"and that, my children, is the story of bart's first day of school."
25419,Homer,"and i gave that man directions, even though i didn't know the way. 'cause that's the kind of guy i am this week."
38746,Homer,"that was not my intent. okay, covercraft: hands in."
18450,Homer,"i don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. what do you have in that secret government file, anyway? i have a right to read it."
19471,Homer,uh-oh. i guess you're cranky because i didn't come home last night...
24590,Homer,television broken?
39047,Homer,it's on your face too!
37358,Homer,"and you know, marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
30051,Homer,i'll always be there. not even death will stop me.
36001,Homer,"...counting the moments to closing time when i can stumble home to you. another round, moe. uh-oh. did i type that? delete! delete! hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."
19323,Homer,oh yeah. you gotta do that.
37976,Homer,look at these jerks.
29655,Homer,woo hoo! that's been my dream ever since i heard it existed right now. what do i get?
32777,Homer,wrong number.
33022,Homer,hello! hello? anybody home? hello?
22906,Homer,god bless america!
34502,Homer,oops.
33103,Homer,i have the situation under control. the compass needle is pointing east.
22460,Homer,give something back? boo! get a haircut!
37106,Homer,women and their horrible thoughts.
40347,Homer,"""neighbors forever. oh, no! ned flanders."""
21510,Homer,"okay, this bacon's done."
24595,Homer,great idea. then we should call the doctor about this.
19036,Homer,"well, i have been eating more..."
38392,Homer,here's a blanket they can borrow
24673,Homer,"oh, don't worry. they'll be here soon. and then they'll see who's got the better town."
36836,Homer,"really? i'm... ...cool? oh, can i man-hug you?"
14217,Homer,so... will you marry me?
32487,Homer,"one battery, please."
38572,Homer,"ooh marge, that was fast. yeah, that's it, baby. grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
21261,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ray. are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?"
38653,Homer,"listen, i-i know you're a robot and incapable of emotion..."
32392,Homer,way to go! many happy returns.
18734,Homer,hear ye! hear ye! ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! chooseth homer simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
32574,Homer,see? that's where my memory stops. who the heck is that guy?
15940,Homer,"two wrongs make a right, lisa. ah, rex morgan m.d., you have the prescription for the daily blues."
29848,Homer,much better.
13737,Homer,see? it was all your imagination.
22637,Homer,maybe you'd feel better if we watched some tv together.
14375,Homer,you think we should bet against them?
29941,Homer,and what's the network?
18180,Homer,no we shan't. yoink!
33139,Homer,i feel the same way about that lamp.
31963,Homer,"i'm stealing five segways at once! and speaking of segues, i'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
25767,Homer,i'll mace you good!
26385,Homer,"we said ""good day""!"
23231,Homer,really? with butterscotch on it?
38692,Homer,poking through.
39456,Homer,"oh come on. that cornball routine. ""i love you, daddy."" give me a break."
14929,Homer,"you know, the painting class, the first aid course, that whole lamaze thing."
18955,Homer,"so how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
35085,Homer,"and i love having you here, son. 'cause you can wake me up if somebody comes."
24211,Homer,"twist off, dammit!"
41235,Homer,"that's it, i'm getting outta here."
14397,Homer,"all right. if you must know, lisa and i have been gambling on pro football."
37765,Homer,i think i'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
20657,Homer,"outta my way, snow-poke!"
40969,Homer,"let's see, powell, powell... powell... pomerant, poole, popkin, potter, quigley, quimby, randolph... whoops, too far. here it is, powell."
33020,Homer,"marge, i can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. but withholding sexy cake? i know we have to move past this, but i don't see how."
17890,Homer,time to fertilize the lawn. a couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
15334,Homer,i know! i'll do a rap. i'm mr. plow and i'm here to say: i'm the plowingest guy in the usa / i got a big plow and i move a lot of things / like your cow it you have one.
21050,Homer,thank you.
30371,Homer,"oh. you always gotta work blue, don't ya marge?"
35805,Homer,"that's great, let me run the numbers because i really want the simpson account. and give these cigars to your children."
25468,Homer,but i wanna!
16162,Homer,yes. we'll send the eye.
33576,Homer,i'm on it.
32947,Homer,"son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of krusty...which appears to be everything. hey, maybe we should give lisa this room. you know she works for krusty now."
35822,Homer,whose side are you on?
32593,Homer,"oh, right."
13824,Homer,"come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. i thought he was just being colorful."
38852,Homer,"well, that's it. we've visited every section including churro county, toonton abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? i'll tell you: fun. the kind of fun attractive families have in commercials."
18167,Homer,"yeah. and who the hell are you talkin' to? marge, do you have other men in this house? radioactive men?"
13724,Homer,"c'mon, you lefties. what'd i tell you?"
21273,Homer,will cash be okay?
32672,Homer,marge! look over there!
20426,Homer,"i knew it. slowing down already, huh?"
18764,Homer,get lost!
36890,Homer,"finally, a woodcutter that will do what i tell him."
36548,Homer,"hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? help a brother out, b.h."
24969,Homer,"oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! we could make a fortune."
31350,Homer,americans!
18421,Homer,i could sit in the aisle.
37302,Homer,"marge, i thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous."
20375,Homer,"but marge, i swear to you, i never thought you'd find out!"
38525,Homer,"seriously, i am getting so tired of those stupid flandersisms."
14869,Homer,that's it?
26251,Homer,okay. lemme check the specs.
16756,Homer,"you're right, marge. just like the time i could've met mr. t at the mall. the entire day, i kept saying, i'll go a little later, i'll go a little later.' and then when i got there, they told me he just left. and when i asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. well, i'm never gonna let something like that happen again. i'm going into space, right now."
37498,Homer,carl's family was even worse than people thought.
18832,Homer,oh... forget it.
17506,Homer,okay.
36024,Homer,"so, dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in lisa's head?"
20320,Homer,"i wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
20016,Homer,"oh, i can't believe it. i've got an enemy. me! the most beloved man in springfield."
30847,Homer,"when the monkey falls asleep, i'll sneak you out in this trash bag. then i'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
24959,Homer,"i know, but which one?"
31940,Homer,i can't! that fire siren could sound at any moment.
27263,Homer,if we formed a club we could serve drinks.
21325,Homer,"you too, marge. if you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
33358,Homer,please! you've gotta have some secret agony! i bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
22345,Homer,my spine.
36758,Homer,"i just want to say, i was having the worst day of my life."
29249,Homer,fine.
30756,Homer,"i don't enjoy it. being a father is just a job. long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
14467,Homer,"barney, i've lost the baby. it's the worst thing i've ever done."
26892,Homer,marge?!
26754,Homer,"c'mon barney, if you're gonna be general grant, you have to have a drink."
27049,Homer,moe's tavern.
34766,Homer,that's my cell phone.
29480,Homer,how do you know about that?
26202,Homer,wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!!
26093,Homer,"love? ""signed photo""?! marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! well i'll show her!"
14665,Homer,what?

22636,Homer,"hey, you're mad at me. that wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?"

41361,Homer,oh my god... is she flirting with me?
25743,Homer,"it's just a legal thing, to protect me."
15242,Homer,"there you are! thought you could get away, huh?"
41460,Homer,"""color my world,"" ""disco sucks"" and butthead the goat."
33444,Homer,"me too, baby. but we gotta get real."
14108,Homer,"hey, do you think aerosmith will be in tonight?"
20000,Homer,"hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip. if you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
17867,Homer,"all right, that's the last straw. it's time to take out the trash. but first, i'm going to have to ask you to leave."
21034,Homer,marge!
16089,Homer,"look, i'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."

36537,Homer,"boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!"
24517,Homer,who told you about those laws? was it marge?
24021,Homer,what do you want me to do?
21063,Homer,mr. moe -- steady as she goes!
29332,Homer,"oh honey, her life can't compare to yours. you've got three kids, a tv tray from expo sixty-seven, and you're married to king stink!"
26935,Homer,"ooh, ooh! here's my commercial!"
22424,Homer,"that's the way max power is, marge. decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
13161,Homer,uhhhh... ummmm...
18676,Homer,"yes, mr. ford!"
36986,Homer,wow. your end of the world is better than my during the world.
31328,Homer,now where's my parade? where's my parade?
30604,Homer,do i have to hang out with them?
38359,Homer,"oh, everyone does, son. that's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
28076,Homer,you can bring a bag of ice.
40253,Homer,"let's go now... sa-winggg, batter!"
19352,Homer,"eh, mornin', apu."
30362,Homer,"where's lisa, boy? this book's gonna solve all her problems."

20707,Homer,oo! oo! me first!
14219,Homer,"you know, i had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
32208,Homer,"wow, praise from placido domingo."
36382,Homer,now that's what i call a snappy retort!
29525,Homer,"don't forget showboating. that's the cornerstone of my ""pyramid of success."""
31934,Homer,what the?! my car?! milhouse?! nutmeat?!
19292,Homer,"what are you doing, marge? didn't you hear the song?"
31251,Homer,"marge, giving me credit was your idea. now could you rub my butt? i sat on it so much it's a little sore."
21205,Homer,then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits diaper hill.
20414,Homer,game's out there! made you look...
36379,Homer,"yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!"
36392,Homer,"eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
16281,Homer,hi guys!
23707,Homer,"hey, don't make me hassle you, lisa."
40946,Homer,i thought i said knock it off!
32247,Homer,no problem.
39655,Homer,"bart! oh bart! bart, bart! oh, bart, my beautiful son. why couldn't you have taken me? of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"

33934,Homer,don't look at me. don't look at me!
25584,Homer,not a chance.
20453,Homer,"don't listen to them, son. i have total faith in you."
39897,Homer,"oh, that sector twelve."
17854,Homer,stay back or i'll boot your prime minister! i'll do it! so help me god i'll boot him!

20323,Homer,"oh, yeah."
15945,Homer,"ooh, delicious."
20802,Homer,"uh yeah, i guess i could lose a few pounds. and i can be kind of thick sometimes."
23867,Homer,too far.
34577,Homer,oh come on! leave me alone! i'm trying to save your precious whales!
32307,Homer,"once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named shrek three. he lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times..."
28556,Homer,"oh. wise guy, eh?"
26120,Homer,"it's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
36566,Homer,note to self: edit out my lies.
38252,Homer,"oh, come here."
20931,Homer,ger-onimo!
38861,Homer,"hey, captain squid! if you really want to be nice to us, how 'bout some snacks?"
13952,Homer,y'ello.
28933,Homer,"don't worry, i've got a man on the perimeter."
18352,Homer,"hey, wait... ""hyper-obesity."" ""if you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
16097,Homer,we're gonna go out and par-ty!
20317,Homer,"oh, let's get that."
24955,Homer,step right up! see the magic boy! witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!
13889,Homer,"marge, i've got to get her a pony. when i look in lisa's eyes, i don't see love anymore."
27798,Homer,"oh. well, where do i twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
29132,Homer,even my best friends have left me! i'm all alone!
41114,Homer,dad!
24988,Homer,dog for sale!
22848,Homer,"look marge, they're advertising my show in ""art in america."" it's the first time i've been mentioned there, that i know of."
17485,Homer,wheeee! wheeee!!!
26377,Homer,"oh, it's no good. everything reminds me of marge."
34698,Homer,"uh, the long island ice teas?"
27870,Homer,you noticed! i've been using lancôme.
17415,Homer,"hey, that's a half truth."
13823,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. we're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
37045,Homer,"dear lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to oz, but don't let flanders be the scarecrow!"
27874,Homer,"maybe it is. i used to look at marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see rip taylor. but now, i don't know what's gonna happen. c'mon, let's dance."
23925,Homer,"just a second, marge. hello! thailand? how's everything on your end? uh-huh. that's some language you got there. and you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
29523,Homer,"""l"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. don't try to stop me. just enjoy the view, sir."
40313,Homer,the only applause i got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
18586,Homer,the hardest shot in bowling. it was all up to me.
20817,Homer,"that's a negatory, good buddy!"
13224,Homer,i was supervising the guns for toys program.
38143,Homer,you guys are crazy. i've never even heard of that guy. it's not like it was painted by leonardo da vinci code.
35834,Homer,they were so childless and miserable.
30124,Homer,"screw you, dino! you squandered your gift!"
37410,Homer,"tent, eh?"
31209,Homer,"sleep tight, my angel!"
36265,Homer,play balll!
38071,Homer,at least someone in this family is using them.
31064,Homer,you used to love my non sequiturs!
22715,Homer,i bet ol' red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
33638,Homer,but i have to marry marge!
16897,Homer,"i don't have time to read. just give me the gist of it, son."
38247,Homer,thanks for telling me. i was gonna tape it.
30742,Homer,"bart, where are you?!"
20897,Homer,whatever happened to your mail order bride?
31233,Homer,"blah blah blah, blah blah blah..."
41066,Homer,nooooooooooooooooooooo!
18277,Homer,lisa! lisa!
20727,Homer,"please, folks. hold your fire. the water level is dangerously low. oh!"
20332,Homer,"well, if he didn't have any guns, i'd show him a thing or two."
18522,Homer,"there you go. now that's not so bad, is it?"
18485,Homer,"mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
25616,Homer,"he shoots, he sco-- my thumb!"
32480,Homer,"now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. we're just gonna get a camera battery and go home."
14770,Homer,i hear ya. come on boy.
13583,Homer,"now listen. i'm bringing michael jackson home to stay with us for a few days... isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
24899,Homer,"gimme a hundred lotto tickets, apu. because mr. x is on a roll."
25732,Homer,"well, marge isn't here. she had to identify a body at the morgue."
34794,Homer,"oh, come on! just a second..."
40486,Homer,"'cause if you don't, i'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
18138,Homer,sorry.
14753,Homer,ooooh.
28259,Homer,"mom, i'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... disney's california adventure."
15455,Homer,"well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge."
24225,Homer,"okay, now do moe."
27111,Homer,can i have forty guest passes?
18927,Homer,yeah. those are exactly my sentimonies.
17644,Homer,"brothers, brothers."
13794,Homer,we could have seen a monkey.
20397,Homer,"okay, don't shoot!"
21346,Homer,"homer simpson here. i've sent the sherpas home and i'm heading for the top, solo."
41019,Homer,because you think i'm dynamic?
33147,Homer,"hmm, all right. the trick is to ease them off--"
23994,Homer,"mmm, that's terrific, duncan. you're ten for ten. now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the nfl."
39955,Homer,what?
37760,Homer,good as new. and thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. it may be a little stretched out.
21282,Homer,come to what?
14015,Homer,"thank you, bill cosby, you saved the simpsons!"
22368,Homer,"follow me, boys. we're finally going to the sup... ow!"
32974,Homer,"now, let's think about this. if you shoot me, i won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. but someone may come after you. probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. what i'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
22539,Homer,roses.
37228,Homer,"your grandfather is super lame! i mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?"
26859,Homer,laxative?
13676,Homer,"so, flanders, have you sold anything?"
21438,Homer,"oh, sorry."
17035,Homer,"well... i can tell the difference between butter and ""i can't believe it's not butter."""
23350,Homer,"wow, it sure is slippery up here."
25847,Homer,"yep. man one, machine zero. how do you like that score?"
14055,Homer,"what's the matter, moe?"
32412,Homer,cha-ching!
36870,Homer,"parenting? let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! it's nature's way!"
17221,Homer,"trust me, marge. with today's modern cars you can't get lost. what with all the silicon chips and such."
28989,Homer,"marge, i won't let that happen. we have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. not 'til lisa's in college and we've lost contact with bart."
22599,Homer,"yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad."
17823,Homer,krusty the clown.
30580,Homer,"hey marge, where you goin'?"
27367,Homer,"look lisa, i'm still trying to get to know you. who's your favorite traveling wilbury? is it jeff lynne?"
21172,Homer,"marge, can i get a duck?"
31965,Homer,make them stop!
29857,Homer,lousy cat.
35235,Homer,tour bus parked. gotta save marge!
24269,Homer,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.
14052,Homer,"you spoke while you were jinxed so i get to punch you in the arm. sorry, it's the law. heh, heh."
30200,Homer,"that'll straighten you out, boy. there, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to hell!"
21012,Homer,but i'm not a h--
25018,Homer,yeah. ya big idiot...
36149,Homer,unguarded stuffff...!
31842,Homer,"thanks, honey. after what you said to me, i watched hours and hours of soccer. i almost saw a goal! but there were so many ads for spanish cell phones..."
38879,Homer,what the?!
32887,Homer,"every time you go, i feel abandoned. but not this time. i'm not gonna let myself get hurt."
16469,Homer,"uh, murphy, you are elf a controllably i think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo."
20876,Homer,"woop, sorry son. i didn't know you, jay leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
27675,Homer,"krusty, you've let everyone down. and even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
39339,Homer,the hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
37373,Homer,"well i'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. but as we say in the snow plow business, ""i'm your astronaut""!"
35857,Homer,"""bloody harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! now, i'm gonna show these boys downtown springfield."
37959,Homer,"i know, mr. sparkle."
13428,Homer,"no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
37092,Homer,name another.
23827,Homer,leprosy? i can't believe it! that fortune cookie was right.
32483,Homer,"battery, battery, battery!"
41337,Homer,she's so cute...
15919,Homer,i'll miss sheriff lobo...
25314,Homer,"you're right. but just to be safe, maybe i should chain him up."
25698,Homer,bullies breaking bread with nerds...
36462,Homer,i'm talkin' about this guy.
39461,Homer,"no! ignore the boy, lord. now can the chatter and bow your heads. dear lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. i mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my french... but they act like savages! did you see them at the picnic? oh, of course you did. you're everywhere. you're omnivorous. oh, lord, why did you smite me with this family?"
33107,Homer,"a really fun party? full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? doesn't seem like your kind of thing, marge."
23259,Homer,"if he's so smart, how come he's dead?"
13366,Homer,marge! what are you doing? are you insane?!
20467,Homer,"aww... you know, tomorrow's the championship game and i could sure use a good offensive tackle."
41478,Homer,i've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest.
16607,Homer,"well, mr. cat burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? there's just one little problem. thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named homer j. sim -- oh my god! underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
33882,Homer,conrad birdie? coming here to sweet apple?!
36688,Homer,my dad had furniture?! i don't know him at all!
16638,Homer,"gig, son. when you're a musician, a job is called a gig."
36012,Homer,that's better.
27905,Homer,everybody in the usa / hates their stupid neighbor / he's flanders and he's really really lame / flanders tried to wreck my song / his views on birth control are wrong / i hate his guts and flanders is his name.
27247,Homer,lisa! explain!
17474,Homer,all right! that's it. we're goin' home. i'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
13790,Homer,"eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... if he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
31838,Homer,could someone bring me another barf cone?
38919,Homer,it's called a double standard. one of the bedrocks of parenting.
39782,Homer,how can i eat it? she made it. it's all i have left.
35230,Homer,eurocentric! when do we have wacky adventures?
18745,Homer,"well, nice talking to you."
17301,Homer,i gotta go back... fix future...
36715,Homer,in my business i try not be seen. i'm scary good at it.
37984,Homer,"that's it, i'm taking you off."
39158,Homer,"chief! thank god! i was drinking at moe's, and i lost an african princess!"
40937,Homer,like my wife's ugly sister.
41206,Homer,"heh, heh, heh, heh."
13195,Homer,all gone!
30150,Homer,"what are you kids laughing at? and if you say jimmy fallon, i'll know you're lying."
39539,Homer,"not now, marge."
36229,Homer,a surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
16512,Homer,no!
19556,Homer,it's gone. and we still don't have any proof.
24771,Homer,consider it done.
37625,Homer,a beer from the sky! it's a sign!
31344,Homer,nope. i'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
22543,Homer,i saw krabappel's butt. i paid.
14603,Homer,hmm...
41044,Homer,no! stay away! this is not for you! this is homer food.
18936,Homer,"hello, selma? selma my dear? how are you? uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... listen, shut up for a second. how would you like to marry apu so he doesn't get deported?"
30015,Homer,"well, moe's getting a big screen tv in february. just in time for the pro bowl. maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
30420,Homer,of course i do. the only thing i can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
32769,Homer,maybe you're drunk.
38335,Homer,"woo-hoo, liquid center power-up!"
14436,Homer,"and uh... later tonight i think you and i should uh, snuggle."
26579,Homer,"there he is! it-- oh wait, you said brown hair, right?"
13440,Homer,bart! what are you staring at?
37194,Homer,i'll give it one marathon.
40136,Homer,"ooh, a vortex."
32355,Homer,"great, great -- i turned over so many wheelbarrows... wait, that was your thing."
38495,Homer,come on. lick it!
21711,Homer,you are sooo dead.
21613,Homer,"thanks, sucker!"
26853,Homer,and i can ride my bike real fast.
18776,Homer,but i think the dodo went extinct...
26804,Homer,...i get knocked down / i get knocked down again / you're never gonna knock me down!
40929,Homer,"but enough about bart. tell me, principal skinner, are you married?"
30025,Homer,you love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
35437,Homer,"oh, what the hell? life is made to be lived. i've been buttoned down too long!"
34206,Homer,could you scooch over a bit?
31652,Homer,"eat marshall tucker, idiot!"
31131,Homer,look at that ugly old man.
37798,Homer,i have a soul and you guys don't!
33541,Homer,how am i gonna get us all across this river?
34358,Homer,must... squeeze... harder!
24692,Homer,"oop, wait a minute..."
20928,Homer,"oh, no! the train!"
31678,Homer,"thanks, boy. hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while i sing public domain songs out the window?"
41429,Homer,not so fast! say hello to the united federation of homers through history!
33771,Homer,it tells you how you can get popular.
29818,Homer,"marge, c'mon!"
25474,Homer,"don't listen to him, duffman. for once in your life, stand up for the little guy!"
23068,Homer,"oooh, they got our number."
26253,Homer,mm-hm.

22699,Homer,"bye, marge!"
20714,Homer,"who, me?"
37982,Homer,"as early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
30858,Homer,how did lenny get to be newsfake magazine's man of the year?
32334,Homer,"oh, hello, marge. i'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. am i disappointed? yes. am i surprised? no."

36081,Homer,now i'm over here!
36291,Homer,"sorry. before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?"
31772,Homer,marge! this isn't like you.
38917,Homer,"look, i don't have time for childish games. if i don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
30611,Homer,marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
28964,Homer,i'll right-side you!
26841,Homer,lousy community service. meals on wheels! eat it up or i go to jail!
22407,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's."

22400,Homer,who-o-oa! who-o-oa! who-o-oa!
16397,Homer,"woo-hoo! see that, boy? your old man was right, not flanders. we are doomed! in your face, flanders!"
15908,Homer,should i whack slow or fast?
17956,Homer,"okay! wait a minute. that's bad! look, i know i'm not witty like that critic guy. but does he know all the words to the oscar mayer song?"
33454,Homer,"baby, i hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause i'm about to file a claim."
19225,Homer,"...and larry and i have so much in common, marge, way more than you and me. if i could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be larry!"
37670,Homer,"aw, don't cry."
18120,Homer,"no, what i was wondering is..."
17742,Homer,okay.
14546,Homer,"something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that i could make a bat out of."
22217,Homer,"oh, that. that can be treated with our good friend alcohol. you might want to write that down. where the hell's your notebook?"
35334,Homer,"i was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired."
39826,Homer,"it won't happen again, sir. i promise. may i get out of your sight now?"
35581,Homer,"how did this happen? last thing i remember, i was decorating the house for halloween."
35441,Homer,what was that?
28675,Homer,"all right, ""chapter one."" hm, that makes sense. ""there once was a girl from nantucket..."" good, good... ""her name was temperance barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. she..."""
39439,Homer,be normal! be normal!
21813,Homer,i'll do that! you go upstairs and have a beer.
16821,Homer,"oh, yeah. a judge made me do that once, too. stupid lack of public urinals. hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, i'm comin' with ya."
13865,Homer,the moron next door closed early!
19538,Homer,"you do?! oh, marge, you've made me so happy!"
28719,Homer,"i am so wasted. oh my god, oh my god, we're having a simultaneous pass out!"
27094,Homer,precisely.
20482,Homer,"o-kay, here we go..."
28930,Homer,"hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage."
13958,Homer,"yes i do. you see lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
18809,Homer,got it.
33073,Homer,"if that boy thinks i'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! stupid kids... think i'm made of hormones..."
17127,Homer,"you see, marge? you see?"
32866,Homer,no.
39103,Homer,"marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like albert."
38431,Homer,"oh god, oh god, i'm the smart parent."
26691,Homer,don't you have criminals to catch?
23334,Homer,"eh, i've had a good run."
39944,Homer,"yes, i do."
31446,Homer,marge's show!
18036,Homer,"a little too well, if you ask me. i'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
32238,Homer,"well that's it, i'm retiring from the opera. it's just too popular."
31548,Homer,"it's not sugar, it's caramel!"
16285,Homer,come on marge. it's fun to smash things. i smashed it good!
30798,Homer,huh?
33974,Homer,"yeah, marge. he'll knock your block off. your beautiful block."
23845,Homer,"bill, bill. oooh! llib! eh-- wait a minute. bill?!"
27337,Homer,"oh, you mean the enron ride. let's go."
39970,Homer,"actually, the simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family."
18121,Homer,"yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
34780,Homer,"well, it was rhubarb."
34621,Homer,"into the playpen, sweetie. and if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
39872,Homer,"wait a minute, skinner. how do we know some principal over in france isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
40639,Homer,"i'm not done yet, marge. what's that word you use for when you and i... you know..."
39530,Homer,"see, that boy? you didn't expect that, did you? and neither will he."
33484,Homer,"i'm back, baby!"
17062,Homer,"look, marge, you don't know what it's like. i'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. and i'm not out of order. you're out of order. the whole freakin' system is out of order. you want the truth? you want the truth? you can't handle the truth. 'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. forget it, marge - it's chinatown."
17016,Homer,what?!
21195,Homer,uh oh.
28086,Homer,"you're welcome. and now marge, we cooked, you clean."
17538,Homer,it's raining men!
26395,Homer,"ten-four, princess. is that your beer tent?"
40244,Homer,"uh... simp-sons, sir."
25201,Homer,yeah... in fact...
18235,Homer,no.

26413,Homer,de-fense! de-fense! de-fense!
19600,Homer,woo hoo!
41560,Homer,"gimme a beer, moe."
41308,Homer,"this simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis."
35265,Homer,"marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. has the joker taught you nothing?"
28255,Homer,"geez, pal."
13886,Homer,"maybe i should just cut my losses, give up on lisa, and make a fresh start with maggie."
13701,Homer,now i don't want it.
23321,Homer,"""rough!"" ah, i don't know. you've been pitching that all night."
33467,Homer,"fine, mr. skeptical. give me back your beads."
18023,Homer,"yes! come on, you little horse!"
23310,Homer,"well, i hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. hm, i seem to be missing a piece of my ear. touché!"
33525,Homer,"no, i'm gonna see it first!"
28204,Homer,cranford man missing. what's he missing? his pants? a train? gimme a break!
41437,Homer,"you're right marge, i could never leave you. not even for you. if there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much."
40744,Homer,it was worth it.
30308,Homer,"okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. is marge saving them or killing them?"
34486,Homer,oh yeah -- sorry i was such a jerk about it.
34242,Homer,never!
22680,Homer,didn't i?
15090,Homer,don't leave me alone with him.
40783,Homer,french. what a coincidence. just the subject i'm having trouble with.
22488,Homer,"yeah, i'm going right to the top."
23296,Homer,are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?
35118,Homer,oh i know.
18879,Homer,"okay, we'll work this out together. first things first: where is knoxville?"
24470,Homer,i'm down.
23605,Homer,"oooh, morlocks... chuds... mole people!"
40438,Homer,will you forget the report! he's down at the rescue mission!
30389,Homer,oh yeah.
31006,Homer,"oh my god, our boat is upside down!"
30181,Homer,but i siphoned that gas from flanders! flanders...
18505,Homer,"well, goodnight, son."
14407,Homer,"well, c'mon, we can still watch the super bowl together. can't we? eh? huh?"
13792,Homer,you think it's him?
30039,Homer,don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.
14660,Homer,"we'll take two tickets to ""the stockholm affair."""
18355,Homer,"i'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. but try to see it my way. all my life i've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
21154,Homer,"mr. burns, i think we can trust the president of cuba."
25295,Homer,"with that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
22719,Homer,sold!
36523,Homer,i didn't say i swapped our house.
27035,Homer,fine. there are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
36553,Homer,i am nature's perfect choking machine!
20100,Homer,"lousy bart... his money... all right, new york, i'm coming back. but you're not getting this!"
28423,Homer,he must be following this thing. well i'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
15215,Homer,wha dey do?
19708,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
25228,Homer,for once in my life i'm tall. don't take that away from me.
15335,Homer,all right.
36206,Homer,roomy.
19677,Homer,"no, no. leave it in."
28563,Homer,"honey, this marriage is a partnership. when you fall, i pick you up. and when you can't finish a sandwich, i eat that sandwich."
33694,Homer,"aw, sweetie, you saved me. well, i promise that wherever you go in this world, i will always be there for you."
39483,Homer,"well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. marge, go get the kids' college fund."
28050,Homer,"top of the mornin', ladies."
38998,Homer,"uh, pittsburgh thirty-five, dallas thirty-one!"
41444,Homer,"ouch! oooch! eeech! ouch! ooch! oh, stop it!!"

28293,Homer,i'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! you can't go to that school!
23046,Homer,but it's so cheap.
30601,Homer,a lamborgotti fasterossa? that's the car i think about when i make love to my wife.
38793,Homer,"okay, okay!"
33350,Homer,"if i had won class president, i'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
21476,Homer,bart! yes.
18312,Homer,i'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
22191,Homer,that's your problem. you're living up here.
30998,Homer,woo hoo! it's almost new year's! ten... nine... eight...
38546,Homer,"hey, tony roma's wasn't built in a day. but don't worry. i told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. you do have drone delivery, right? i kinda promised that."
19552,Homer,"yeah, me too."
28708,Homer,i was so close.
35088,Homer,"damn, that hurt!"
19615,Homer,no sir. i am not.
34214,Homer,i know. it's where i hide my adult magazines.
40459,Homer,that was beautiful. can we go now?
37203,Homer,feather boas?
19941,Homer,can lenny have it?
30646,Homer,but i do a great impression of him.
14188,Homer,for several years i'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
23617,Homer,daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. yes he is. yes he is.
29916,Homer,"but that's not true, bart saw him at the builder's barn."
39585,Homer,"aw, come on."
31930,Homer,zombie kill.
25261,Homer,that seems about right.
37671,Homer,i'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
16284,Homer,woo hoo! it's garret morris' birthday.
19221,Homer,he made fun of my weight.

24675,Homer,"oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""pacman fever / a do do do do / it's driving me crazy."" look lisa, daddy's in the who!"
19034,Homer,"lisa, let's go!"
28594,Homer,bike's over there.
14345,Homer,"huh, they both make a good case."
18159,Homer,"me! me! me, me!"
32774,Homer,i thought you might have trouble with this. that's why i'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. someone you'd never expect.
40381,Homer,"what, are you afraid to make a real bet?"
37218,Homer,look at all this wrestling stuff.
30399,Homer,this-this is marge's bra. i bought it for her boobs!
32599,Homer,"for the love of god, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
30720,Homer,"hey guys, i have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then i'll be back to go to vegas!"
30512,Homer,i don't know. what happened to the last safety salamander?

40392,Homer,"see you downstairs, boy."
35714,Homer,"yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"
37378,Homer,since when?
16054,Homer,"c'mon! gimme the hand, you stupid dog! c'mon! gimme' that!"

31493,Homer,an unexpected occurrence?! what could it be?!
39226,Homer,"oh, thank god for the big jar."
34012,Homer,helllp me!
26698,Homer,"all my other senses are getting sharper. bart, you had pizza for lunch. lisa, you're extremely depressed."

16751,Homer,default? woo hoo! the two sweetest words in the english language. de-fault! de-fault! de-
23692,Homer,"wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! i feel like i've gone back in a time machine."
15751,Homer,"it's just a movie, son. there's nobody that evil in real life."
31720,Homer,"give it here, i'll find some fat we can trim. here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in."
22054,Homer,"well, actually, you did..."
38752,Homer,"buddy, buddy. think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night. you just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
22526,Homer,uhhhh.
15690,Homer,"something wrong, officer?"
23248,Homer,i'm on top of it.
23633,Homer,"oh, current... too strong... i know! if i sink to the bottom i can run to the shore."
33271,Homer,"oh, look at that. we're out of almond paste. don't get up. i'll grind the almonds myself."

13231,Homer,"oh you know, i'm a guy at a place. how'd you get such a crappy job? you a convict or a junkie?"

16454,Homer,"hee, hee, hee, hee. did you know hogan had tunnels all over your camp?"
28207,Homer,"from what, too much hot fudge? huh? c'mon bart, show me some love!"
39920,Homer,"did you hear that, marge? my boy speaks french."
34301,Homer,"well i don't. the motto of the simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead."""
34638,Homer,lousy--
17624,Homer,i've learned my lesson!
23122,Homer,"uh, you're thinking about me, right?"

33494,Homer,poltergeist in the closet...
15077,Homer,"i mean don't worry, son. i forgot to get you a present. but i swear on my father's grave..."
25131,Homer,"better. i was working on a flat tax proposal, and i accidentally proved there's no god."
22103,Homer,they'll be fine in half an hour.
23941,Homer,propellers... spinning! turn... left! boat go... there!
34182,Homer,songwriters who are stuck!
30341,Homer,that's bull man.
31896,Homer,move over just a...
34770,Homer,"fine, i'll get the hook."
22632,Homer,"if you've got to do something, click this pen."
33816,Homer,i feel like i've died and gone to hell.
17966,Homer,what'd i miss?
32379,Homer,"wow, you guys are good. the alien's right here in the living room."
24610,Homer,"it's not fair! i've been a fan of the who since the very beginning, when they were the hillbilly bugger boys."
25798,Homer,"i haven't had buffalo in six hours. marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-o.j."
34775,Homer,"hey, i've had a hard trip too. one of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
41146,Homer,"oh, shut up."
33500,Homer,"flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on christmas, would you?"
27884,Homer,uh-oh. gotta even it out.
19470,Homer,"hi, honey."
40315,Homer,my wife and kids stood by me. on the way home i realized how little that helped.
21763,Homer,"okay, remember where we parked."
27762,Homer,"sweetie, these things are gonna take time. i just found the door-shutting thing."
18700,Homer,"oh, this game could mean big things for me, marge. if i beat mr. burns, i mean really wallop him bad... i'm sure to get that big raise i've been gunning for."
31160,Homer,"so, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
21347,Homer,the hell i won't. you're forgetting i've got my power sauce bars.
23229,Homer,"ooh, let's go to the waterpark. my ten-year ban ended yesterday."
35383,Homer,"lady, i'm not a hairdresser -- i just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
38410,Homer,"well, you know--"
19421,Homer,"one... two... hey, what's the big idea?"
40624,Homer,"""try something new, homer. what'll it hurt you, homer?"" i never heard of a poison pork chop."
37201,Homer,"in the money game, cash is king."
40099,Homer,"well, thanks, karl. i don't know what to say."
35430,Homer,"stop who, marge? be specific."
28329,Homer,"yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
37791,Homer,yes. we'll be back by three. homer has a very tight nap schedule.
13174,Homer,snake!
39628,Homer,i'll tell you when we get there. go back to your smell game.

13535,Homer,"all right, all right. i'll get lisa to do it."
24192,Homer,woo hoo!
37635,Homer,should've chopped off bart's head long ago.
18042,Homer,"i'm with you, marge. lisa, get in here! in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."
26732,Homer,"ah, nothing can make me mad out here."
19550,Homer,"now, son, you don't want to drink beer. that's for daddies, and kids with fake ids... besides, it's such a beautiful night. how about a ghost story?"
15653,Homer,"for your information, i'm his father!"
17875,Homer,"no, my invention! all my money problems could've..."
26101,Homer,"why look, it's chad sexington!"
24630,Homer,oh yeah? what is it?
34938,Homer,"no, it's not. i just told a lie so we could go to hawaii."
31995,Homer,"well, i can breathe out okay."
37857,Homer,uh-uh! no way! i'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! and maybe that guy. lincoln-style. but that's it.
31226,Homer,don't tell me how many times to think!

35415,Homer,"aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life warren beatty lived in ""shampoo."" and now it's time to pay you back..."
14711,Homer,my personal hygiene has been described as...
18141,Homer,--son!
13376,Homer,"wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. who's general sherman?"
19927,Homer,"i'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
32798,Homer,"boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
24038,Homer,but what if i have to do my business?
19569,Homer,"what do you need to make money for anyway? as long as i have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
35913,Homer,"a high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
14159,Homer,i sure do!
31044,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. i got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room."
30490,Homer,no father's day eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... daddy claus?
23333,Homer,"ooh, sweet."
26401,Homer,"don't worry, honey. we can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, i promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."
35337,Homer,woo hoo! first in line! brought you a gift bag.
18516,Homer,wake up everybody! it's world war three!
29049,Homer,i'll show him.
31507,Homer,"just think, lisa, if i had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!"
39008,Homer,bye!
25460,Homer,they're moving the team to albuquerque!
32345,Homer,"don't worry, sir. i'll handle this cleanly, quietly and bart!"
37023,Homer,"goodbye, my electrical friends. i can't afford to use you, so i'm doing what any good american would do -- throw you away."
39258,Homer,no!
35266,Homer,"son, i'm really, really sorry."
13391,Homer,sorry.
19417,Homer,"marge, we're missing the chili! less artsy, more fartsy!"
18878,Homer,"all right, i have thought this through. i will send bart the money to fly home, and then i will murder him."
17252,Homer,"it's the rapture! quick, get bart out of the house before god comes!"
29983,Homer,time to take out the euro-trash.
37155,Homer,"if i buy you, why do i need all these books?"
21355,Homer,"it just keeps going! i give up. you beat me, mountain!"
24271,Homer,"gold bars discovered by marge? zero. gold bars discovered by homer? well, let's just see..."
18730,Homer,that's for my master to decide.
20672,Homer,there's only one way out. we've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
37500,Homer,attention everyone in iceland! we have an important announcement!
39379,Homer,oh.
33021,Homer,"first, why don't you and i and the cake take a shower?"
33477,Homer,"and on the zillionth day, god created hugs."
15129,Homer,"well, i've always been a firm believer in the three ""r's"": ""reading tv guide""... ummmm, writing to tv guide... and renewing tv guide."
33436,Homer,this was due two weeks ago! i'm not insured! for the first time in my life i'm financially responsible for my own actions!
25414,Homer,"oh, really..."
17581,Homer,next.
19722,Homer,"hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! those finks double-crossed me!"
31312,Homer,this hurts so much.
32089,Homer,i'm aroused and confused.
38802,Homer,gimme another one.
21828,Homer,"oh, i can't. i promised i wouldn't."
20784,Homer,"who cares what it is? the point is these are some decent, generous people that i can take advantage of."
30662,Homer,i hope i never hear that god-awful nutcracker music again.
15285,Homer,bart! that car belonged to bonnie and clyde! show a little respect.
38920,Homer,"no. marge, if i lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. oh, i guess, as a fallback, i could direct films like angelina jolie. how many properties do we have an option on?"
14834,Homer,"oh, my god!! woo hoo! i win!"
37002,Homer,baritone.
24557,Homer,"hey, i thought you guys could see everything."
41042,Homer,"no! no! no! bad dog! let go! bad santa's little helper! stop it! no, not the sports section! no!"
37910,Homer,you!
13586,Homer,here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
26317,Homer,krackle was my favorite.
41397,Homer,"after we eat it, can we let it go? can we catch a submarine?"
37548,Homer,"you guys are the best. i just want you to know when i'm holding marge in my arms tonight, i'll be thinking of all of you."
21199,Homer,"hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men."
38272,Homer,"hey, guys! why are you ducked down like that?"
31117,Homer,"thanks, marge. it's not a twist-off!"
23949,Homer,look at those poor saps back on land. with their laws and ethics. they'll never know the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.
31979,Homer,"deep down, i... i guess i knew that."
32612,Homer,oh right. just leave! but kick like a rockette!
30251,Homer,i swear.
30014,Homer,"honey, our time together is precious to me. i didn't want to say anything, but i don't think i'm gonna be around much longer."
38356,Homer,"why are you doing this to me, booze? i drank every kind of you!"
13782,Homer,their eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
23666,Homer,"man, the last nine months sure were crazy."
27103,Homer,noooo!!
14214,Homer,"oh, i wrote down what i was gonna say on a card. stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
26927,Homer,"finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people."
32596,Homer,what plan?
23733,Homer,really? read it.
26904,Homer,"oh. seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
15432,Homer,i keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
24028,Homer,"well, it is a good life, believe me... all right, we'll give it a shot. i'll deal with those murderous trolls."
40349,Homer,"too bad we don't live on a farm. let's go, boy."
39922,Homer,"oooh, premium -- wait a minute. why?"
23767,Homer,i think what lisa meant to say is...
33519,Homer,"kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy."
14492,Homer,"yes you are. you've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on tv. i know, i'll build him a dog house."
16853,Homer,now how 'bout that game at the pitch 'n putt?
29289,Homer,"that's ridiculous, honey. you're the cutest little girl i know. you just have what is known as the simpson butt. permit me to elaborate."
33299,Homer,you're the nerd.
37371,Homer,deacon? is that like one of those weird catholic priest things?
35466,Homer,"well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. that's a burn on you, flanders."
18401,Homer,sound alertness horn? y-e-s.
39409,Homer,same here.
13692,Homer,"um, mr. burns..."
38725,Homer,it's like some kind of guitar central.
23597,Homer,mm-hmmm.
15163,Homer,"sorry, but the punishment stands."
36490,Homer,voop! voop! voop! voop!
36935,Homer,"oh my god, dad... i owe you an apology. you saved bongo. i never understood that till now."
20879,Homer,i also have to go. booo!
28284,Homer,my name is nelthon! i use a thalad fork. la-dee-dah! i wash my face!
35199,Homer,he's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
18232,Homer,"what was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... moe? look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... moe?"
25305,Homer,i don't think they saw me.
27032,Homer,what the-- where's my money?
21335,Homer,"if you're trying to scare me, it won't work. i'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. hey, my hat has ear flaps!"
35461,Homer,"little help... little help... flanders, little help?"
24738,Homer,"no, i like to save the environment in my own way."
31541,Homer,i've never seen marge like a dvd about a place so much. i'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her ipod.
37021,Homer,"we can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?"
37170,Homer,leave it to me...
27407,Homer,"lisa, i can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. i'm the worst dad in the world."
39584,Homer,listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
22109,Homer,"so, how'd you get the nickname ""legs""?"
37319,Homer,searchy? where can i find brake fluid?
24194,Homer,"so have fun everybody. and who knows? maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise."
37737,Homer,"nice sunglasses, lenny."
36804,Homer,as promised: the miracle!
13689,Homer,"homer simpson, sir."
24919,Homer,who are you and why are you holding me here? i want answers now or i want them eventually.
30483,Homer,"lord, i'm coming home to you / alabama!"
15986,Homer,"i miss you too, honey."
34898,Homer,"hmm... back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, flanders' mailbox, lenny's freezer, tire fire."
15076,Homer,oh yeah? with what?
37830,Homer,ooh! thank you.
22886,Homer,"so long, the simpsons!"
17745,Homer,"come on marge, show a little enthusiasm."
18057,Homer,"well, it's like the time that your cat, snowball, got run over."
37282,Homer,i don't like the sound of that funeral march.
13244,Homer,"aw c'mon, serious homer, let me out! we'll get a monkey drunk and push him down the stairs."
20981,Homer,"oh, lisa's right. we're nothing but a big bunch of losers. show's over, folks. go home."
41029,Homer,and some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! like tail fins! and bubble domes! and shag carpeting!
13926,Homer,"fine, i will. there's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
13633,Homer,mmmmmm... money.
32961,Homer,"objection, your honor."
14390,Homer,"well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter's picks."
31721,Homer,"no, no. this place is too expensive. i saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
26226,Homer,"you know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face."
17322,Homer,stop him! he's headed for the window!
19041,Homer,"i forgot my swimsuit, too. but i improvised."
32218,Homer,hua-hua!
24873,Homer,what a bombshell!
39468,Homer,i wish i could hear what they're saying.
23525,Homer,"no, i'd rather die!"
38204,Homer,rockin'
20053,Homer,dad? is that really you?
20860,Homer,"get a load of the bowl job, marge."
33346,Homer,"no, he's ten days younger."
27252,Homer,our lives are ruined!
29226,Homer,maybe this'll help.
14512,Homer,what if i catch on fire?
24646,Homer,you're right. we've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
19029,Homer,"you know what the song says, ""it's hip to be square."""
37259,Homer,just what do you want?!
27556,Homer,but not too crispy.
17939,Homer,but what can i do? i'm just... one man.
24603,Homer,"don't you miss the old 636, carl?"
26553,Homer,let's try the red one again.
25511,Homer,get her outta here.
37022,Homer,"good riddance. when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, i really lost interest."
26243,Homer,"wait, wait, wait..."
21870,Homer,"well, there were script problems from day one."
35379,Homer,who undid my do?
24656,Homer,i can't believe those traitors abandoned us. they couldn't take one lousy famine.
35748,Homer,"gentlemen! to ""the troll twins of underbridge academy!"""
18152,Homer,he can't remember my name!
32537,Homer,"moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and i can't remember what happened last night. was i here?"
35988,Homer,i'll take it! provided you charge me for services that google offers for free.
39495,Homer,good idea.
16410,Homer,thanks boy. now be careful when you...
14708,Homer,"really? well, i should warn you... i'm not great with figures..."
18633,Homer,"hey, big spender! / dig this blender! / rainbow suspenders!..."
38536,Homer,"what are you doing here, freezer stealer?"
35852,Homer,"yeah, after i stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
21447,Homer,g'night.
17567,Homer,"hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
30477,Homer,"oh marge, i love her so much."
39338,Homer,"don't worry son, you can have mine. here, let me show you how to put on a tie."
15400,Homer,"all right, i know how to handle this. just use a little reverse psychology. let's go, marge. leave the baby with his little crib."
16609,Homer,"well, no matter what the paper says, i still have a job to do."
29317,Homer,"one of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. how you solved crimes i'll never know."
24898,Homer,"real news is great, son. but i'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-a bull plop."
37978,Homer,"now, a simple sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
37617,Homer,"aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, i couldn't take that in."
41043,Homer,stupid dog.
26545,Homer,"ooo, fascinating."
18470,Homer,mo-om! you're not looking!
15195,Homer,no.
33397,Homer,"debbie, i forgot i have an english paper due on monday. would you read ""to kill a mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how boo radley fits into the southern gothic tradition, that would be great."
37805,Homer,you didn't tell me he was a soldier.
13833,Homer,come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.
16150,Homer,"i think i'm so big. blah, blah, blah."
23126,Homer,"well, that was a stinker."
18151,Homer,"oh, you're a dead man! oh, you're dead! you're dead burns!"
35044,Homer,god you're hilarious.
28836,Homer,"marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!"
20343,Homer,woo hoo!
19306,Homer,shut up and let the woman talk.
30474,Homer,okay.
19176,Homer,yes!
37952,Homer,but why pick me?
41139,Homer,oh noooooo!!!!
14075,Homer,i need to talk to moe.
17989,Homer,"oh, right."
40671,Homer,"never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other."
18504,Homer,"now you, boy!"
13683,Homer,"hey, boy. how was class?"
38309,Homer,"marge please, control your jealousy. this is your daughter!"
26769,Homer,"in my role as customer, i saw the whole thing."
24956,Homer,"come on, pony up, flanders. the kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
27887,Homer,"you guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?"
29087,Homer,"oh, this is so confusing. i'd like a brief recess."
22900,Homer,a mascot contest?! i'm sure to win that. unless one of you jinxes me.
30037,Homer,neither. i'm both.
40054,Homer,"nothing... well, that newsletter."
27902,Homer,maybe.
21745,Homer,you intergalactic hussy! how could you?! was he better than me?
19899,Homer,"aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
34862,Homer,"now boy, everyone in town gets burns for half an hour to do as they will."
19298,Homer,"keep it down in there, everybody."
20446,Homer,"oh, really? do reeky players get the game ball?"
20043,Homer,"lenny, tell mr. burns i've gone home to work on the contest."
23444,Homer,'cause i'm trying to think! what would zorro do?
39835,Homer,"look, i'm not drinking out of the carton. come on, marge. please forgive me? i'm sorry. i'm so sorry."
34894,Homer,i got the idea from a show where people regret these.
27321,Homer,"whoa, wait. frank grimes wasn't married. how could he have a son?"
40046,Homer,great! great! great! how much? how much? how much?
19868,Homer,"well -- and i can explain, remember -- i fill the balls with beer that i found at the dump, then i bowl them and some underground pipes take them into moe's."
29609,Homer,"okay, what's next? adam and steve or madam and eve?"
32343,Homer,"the problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you."
23475,Homer,"leave me alone, you big bully."
28099,Homer,"let's see. what native american activities should we do? making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the civil war."
29192,Homer,"""all my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. i may be her father, but when i grow up, i wanna be just like her. except still a dude."""
32404,Homer,sleep tight. the container store now has five convenient locations!
37942,Homer,up bup bup bup bup! what have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
33609,Homer,"don't worry, dad. we'll get out. america is the new york yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
40970,Homer,"no, i've called all three herbert powells in detroit. nothing."
16445,Homer,"hi, son. howya... ewww."
40479,Homer,"he's got us, marge. there's nothing we can do. he's as good as dead."
15723,Homer,"thank you, that'd be nice."
16511,Homer,"no! please, please, please, please, please..."
14530,Homer,"i may hold you to that, marge."
34127,Homer,it's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... my father is interesting?! the whole world's upside down! that must mean cathy is funny.
28362,Homer,"kids, we're going mother's day shopping! i'm glad this holiday only comes every four years."
41169,Homer,"oh, isn't that wonderful. my work and my home life come together in such a nice way. marge, may i see you in the other room?"
14959,Homer,"uh-oh. here, boy."
22288,Homer,serves you little punks right. maybe next time you'll think befo--
35141,Homer,my little roman polanski!
22468,Homer,tree-huggers...
32663,Homer,"with the nineties drawing to a close, and the sydney olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled..."
29714,Homer,but he loves me.
35091,Homer,"hmm, the boy's acting really weird. i did everything that tv show told me to and he's still not happy."
15383,Homer,"dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. i'd be honored if you came to live with us."
32500,Homer,"finally, some service. now listen. we wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- michigan or better."
19686,Homer,nope.
38372,Homer,"well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
33319,Homer,"a simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
37643,Homer,"i'm an idiot! of course! i get marge to marry moe, then i kill moe, then she gets the ring, then i marry her, and the ring is mine. and the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
36072,Homer,there's no sex like fugitive sex.
27455,Homer,"why you little... oh, hi jesus. i was just..."
36196,Homer,woo hoo!
33548,Homer,"great time to nap, einstein!"
39544,Homer,do you know where my keys are?
21823,Homer,did too!
29205,Homer,"hey chief, throw me your piece."
15669,Homer,"apu, you gotta help me! i need a valentine's gift for my wife."
37412,Homer,thank god i'm not in the shower!
24263,Homer,you should've thought of that before you dropped out of the devry institute.
36776,Homer,okay.
33218,Homer,"mr. teddy, can you ask lisa if she's mad? what's that, mr. teddy? you're saying that you know women? and that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?"
40900,Homer,"oh, no."
40049,Homer,"so i say ""forget you, pal! thanks for nothing!"", and i storm right outta there."
35494,Homer,"also, if you wanna find the real shooter of mr. burns, go back and look for more clues. they're all there!"
23134,Homer,"and i've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
32662,Homer,i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos.
31562,Homer,how many yum-yum fish did we get?
40994,Homer,even pork chops?
28873,Homer,that's my girl!
35978,Homer,and ours!
19088,Homer,"oh yeah. so long, stinktown."
39380,Homer,i'm fine. i'm just thinking.
17372,Homer,"hurry, marge. if we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving musketeers."
41566,Homer,he who is tired of weird al is tired of life.
33637,Homer,who would do this to me?! it would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
15941,Homer,"hey, moe, can i look too?"
20872,Homer,i still don't get it.
25156,Homer,moe szyslak?!
18436,Homer,the ice cream man!
37079,Homer,"wowww. your house is perfect. no sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool grampa..."
15692,Homer,"you know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops."
15870,Homer,i discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
15695,Homer,"yeah, syrup is better than jelly."
20584,Homer,lenny really wanted to go.
27586,Homer,sorry. i just wanna win my son back so badly.
22053,Homer,"the name on the back says ""honeybunch."""
35606,Homer,but i guess i should find out a little bit about you.
31486,Homer,angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of headmaster greystash...
35520,Homer,wayne!
18424,Homer,"this may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! i'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! the overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. and they're gonna make their voices heard! all they need is a leader!"
39599,Homer,"just be happy with what you got, son. don't try to keep up with the flanderses."
27837,Homer,whatever.
13387,Homer,she's perfect.
14181,Homer,"yeah, and i have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating i always get."
24924,Homer,"no, sir."
40635,Homer,so you're going to die... 
21575,Homer,reading about this edison character. they won't let me in the big people library downtown. there was some unpleasantness. i can never go back.
27836,Homer,yeah.
13417,Homer,"i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!"
21838,Homer,"all right, i'll go. but the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old homer won't be here anymore."
14825,Homer,"well friend, you're going back where you came from. the curb in front of flanders' house."
14320,Homer,you must think we're the worst parents in the world.
29009,Homer,"marge, i guess we'll just have to make love in heaven. i'll bet it always works up there."
32347,Homer,have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
15855,Homer,"i don't know. i flunked latin, too."
33186,Homer,"uh-huh, got it. marge, i'm going to a hardcore gay club, and i won't be home till three in the morning!"
13262,Homer,hamlet... avenge me!
25217,Homer,they'll pay for what they did to my can.
16692,Homer,are we in india yet?
33998,Homer,you mean tell her i love her? or i meaning you?
16874,Homer,he's taking the elephant instead of the money.
29918,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
21756,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
19407,Homer,where? to the big annual what?
27116,Homer,all-access.
37085,Homer,"man, you sure can talk surfer talk."
26870,Homer,"oh man, what a day. i'd kill for a beer."
38153,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
28177,Homer,"okay, who am i giving the finger to today?"
41266,Homer,now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover!
24585,Homer,"wait, stop! we can outsmart those dolphins! don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. i'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
34666,Homer,"marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
35420,Homer,"cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? you will?!"
35788,Homer,i really should look at this picture a little longer.
33451,Homer,"oh, mr. burns! why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
14612,Homer,well... i guess we'll have to talk it over.
28990,Homer,i've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
25778,Homer,"run, children! run!"
35725,Homer,a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
30423,Homer,"now, i'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. do you think i could..."
27597,Homer,"i put you in humiliating commercials for money, which i spent on myself. i just wish i had an opportunity to make things right."
21934,Homer,"seth, munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""uptown girl / she's been living in her white-bread world..."" come on, guys... uptown girl..."
41265,Homer,oh glory of glories! oh heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of god's creation!
14602,Homer,what do kids know about spending money?
28912,Homer,"well, that's the end of my shift."
21312,Homer,"ow! ow! ow! boy, am i feeling this. ow! oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. ow!"
21848,Homer,"only 5, no wait 10 dollars. you heard right, 20 dollars."
23104,Homer,"hello, i, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos."
19507,Homer,"then, i insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
35243,Homer,"hold on, lemme get the door here."
14663,Homer,"who's that guy?... what did that guy say when i said, ""who's that guy?"""
19383,Homer,"hope you like it, neighbor. we didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
36468,Homer,sorry.
35130,Homer,only my hairdresser knows for sure.
32299,Homer,who are you guys?
32812,Homer,"yeah, me too. since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
35836,Homer,"now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
28905,Homer,"interesting. marge, what does that sign say?"
32136,Homer,"oh, it was great! flew to tulsa on the company jet. did my job in a way consistent with what i already told you. because that's what you do. when you have a job."
31951,Homer,"hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
18794,Homer,except... i killed mr. burns.
25111,Homer,"you mean, like, medical testing?"
16486,Homer,well i guess you'll want to come in.
17597,Homer,"aw, thanks, lenny. when am i gonna be initiated?"
38080,Homer,fine. i'll take you. they have this cool psych class at the campus i sat in on.
33427,Homer,who taught you that language?!
27987,Homer,"all right, you're not a coward. and that's beside the point because--"
35078,Homer,"hey, apu."
34409,Homer,porky pig?
26469,Homer,you sunk my scrabbleship!
33740,Homer,"oh, i'm big and yellow / and i'm servin' jell-o / if you're a fellow and you want some jell-o / you'd better bellow / hey, big guy / gimme some jell-o"
38547,Homer,dammit!
40651,Homer,"shut up! bart, this is good stuff. i want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. number one, ""cover for me."" number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" number three, ""it was like that when i got here."""
22833,Homer,"in high school i was voted ""most likely to be a mental patient, hillbilly, or chimpanzee!"""
28318,Homer,"well, marge, you've gotta admit. i've been on my best behavior this trip."
18341,Homer,"yeah! especially your big fat... oh, wait."
26149,Homer,"now all we need is our astronaut. bart, where's america's newest hero?"
34734,Homer,come in. come in. don't wipe your feet.
30071,Homer,this whole deal is scientifically proven. the book of revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at the last supper...
28379,Homer,ants!
33989,Homer,"ooo, ooo, can i go, marge? can i? can i?"
32901,Homer,i'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
41527,Homer,i understand. we should follow the lead of today's celebrity role models.
16858,Homer,"i'd love to honey, but daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
35095,Homer,the boy's flash drive may be in there. but i've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
27192,Homer,forget it kiki. you're not putting your brain into her body.
19639,Homer,what do we do?
30110,Homer,"oh, i'm wrong again. i'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
29153,Homer,yes.
34384,Homer,hold that thought.
33183,Homer,and you will again. because he isn't really dead. and now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
34843,Homer,ta-da!
19987,Homer,"that didn't explain anything. all i know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". there's no other explanation."
19759,Homer,you! i should have known!
32797,Homer,confederate degenerate?
30246,Homer,"marge would kill me! please, there's gotta be something else i can do. like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. i can't do it next week."
27132,Homer,"oh, yeah... when you've been in as many as i have, you can sense them coming."
20868,Homer,"why, yes. yes i do."
40849,Homer,the lad has a point.
39113,Homer,"and because you love me, i will not stop yo-yo dieting till i get it right."
13413,Homer,"wow, i did it! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. i fought it for six hours. she says one word and i toss it back. and you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? come here, baby."
37179,Homer,we'll get those kids back.
21275,Homer,"close, but you're way off."
26484,Homer,lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
32107,Homer,"no way. i don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or ""guru""."
19760,Homer,"look, john, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. just stay the hell away from my family!"
22724,Homer,you'll never believe what happened. i fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
18616,Homer,good ol' evergreen terrace. the swankiest street in the classiest part of pressboard estates.
20971,Homer,that's a good idea. let's go out for some frosty swirls.
15906,Homer,woo hoo!
24332,Homer,barney...
36467,Homer,people here do not respect boundaries.
33584,Homer,"okay... ""pitch in the negro leagues,"" i can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
31366,Homer,"hey, pal. like the way you handle that mop. you like killing? hey, ladies. are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? i know i am."
30741,Homer,you little monster! show your face this minute!
33161,Homer,i don't want to let go of our special carving!
39412,Homer,hey! what's the problem here?
21393,Homer,lisa... lisa...
24795,Homer,anti-polio.
32066,Homer,apu sang a song. what are you gonna do?
33904,Homer,"great. okay. marge, go."
26551,Homer,"all right, let's try the red one."
26047,Homer,"ah. and now to read my fortune. ""geese can be troublesome."" what the hell is that supposed to mean?"
19847,Homer,prohibition! they tried that in the movies and it didn't work. i predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
36465,Homer,bart! don't call me that!
40265,Homer,"what's wrong with you people? let's show some spirit! come on, get up!"
25719,Homer,miss work? but my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
14500,Homer,"what is it, flanders?"
26775,Homer,that guy's hilarious. his reaction would be priceless.
19845,Homer,i'll come with you.
27288,Homer,"look, junior. i expect this to be fixed with quality gm parts."
17693,Homer,"actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. at that time, i had no idea maggie even existed."
19261,Homer,"geez, look at this place. we gotta do something."
19828,Homer,can you see the pie stains?
33388,Homer,huh? who said that?
30270,Homer,let it ring. play hard to get. that's hard enough!
31724,Homer,why are you telling me? he's your father-in-law.
31767,Homer,"tick tock, sweetie."
24327,Homer,"lenny, carl, i know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. to me, you're true blue."
25769,Homer,yes!
30833,Homer,springfield high football rules!
19305,Homer,"you know what you two need? a little comic strip called ""love is."" it's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
22224,Homer,the what now?
37919,Homer,woo hoo!
36456,Homer,"daughters of jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
19564,Homer,marge! how could you?
28192,Homer,let the baby have her bottle.
25481,Homer,"you know, i think our marriage is..."
38422,Homer,"well, if that's how you think it has to be."
34015,Homer,i'd like to try most every guy / from here to timbuk-tee
13275,Homer,exactly. exaaaaactly.
37851,Homer,"marge, to that i say boo, humbug."
18315,Homer,"just a second... no, it's a place i've never been before."
37934,Homer,i'll sign with whoever can convince channing tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
32439,Homer,marge! marge!
23943,Homer,"well done, mr. lenny. well done."
41001,Homer,"oh, okay. i'd like a big one, then."
28227,Homer,i think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
40118,Homer,i don't know... a hundred and two?
26865,Homer,without a trace.
16578,Homer,"you know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
32968,Homer,i make that in a year.
21504,Homer,"yo, apu, gimme the usual."
37657,Homer,"you're rejecting me? but i'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
34549,Homer,"be careful! if you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
40364,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. this time move your head and don't follow through."
23416,Homer,"will you duel, or are you a coward?!"
16818,Homer,"i'd like to introduce ned flanders, my best friend."
39117,Homer,"moe, quick! beer me before i answer the phone!"
21537,Homer,"dear lord, i know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. but if you help us steal this grease tonight, i promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
26199,Homer,"oh, no! the roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
16772,Homer,"what do you mean? it says right here: ""free wig with every purchase of large wig. downtown wig center."" why you little... hmmm... free wig."
24060,Homer,quit hogging flanders. i want to comfort him.
27683,Homer,"i say, i say... my groin!"
34446,Homer,woo hoo! i'm drinking my salary!
13446,Homer,nah.
33497,Homer,kadiddlehopper.
30855,Homer,"why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? i like your hat, sweetie."
21888,Homer,"i'm gonna be a hippie, just like mom wanted. i'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of god's creatures!"
19039,Homer,i left a few helpful notes around the house...
25383,Homer,i am a robot. do what i say.
25739,Homer,don't tell me what i'm not doing.
40707,Homer,"goodbye, maggie -- stay as sweet as you are."
25272,Homer,door.
39864,Homer,make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
35831,Homer,fatso flanagan!
30267,Homer,"you mean ""homer's famous marinara sauce."""
32780,Homer,"see? now go, boy!"
14083,Homer,"hey, moe?"
19400,Homer,"c'mon, flanders. there's got to be something you hate. what about mosquito bites?"
26525,Homer,quit suffocating me. i'm going to moe's.
20943,Homer,"hurry up, moe, for the love of god! hurry up!"
33790,Homer,"ladies, we've got it all. rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys."
19150,Homer,"well, the simpson men are doing fine, right, bart? you haven't even gotten in trouble at school."
36323,Homer,totally scripted.
37621,Homer,just like when i smell up the toilet.
25254,Homer,"of course i do, dad."
29029,Homer,"that's really sweet, honey."
21722,Homer,idiot?! why you... little...
23897,Homer,"oh, right. the ice pick."
37148,Homer,the melody is by beethoven
23269,Homer,"thanks for the chance. you won't never regret this, mr. editing guy!"
36167,Homer,why can't i cork my wang-wine?
33334,Homer,"oh, i get it. here's ten bucks."
14507,Homer,"hey marge, do you want to hear something funny? flanders thinks i swear too much. marge, you're not laughing."
27499,Homer,"it worked! i got my wish! from now on, i'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding."
31496,Homer,he killed greystash!
23889,Homer,"quick, pass me down!"
35707,Homer,marge! this isn't a food restaurant! it's a meth restaurant! a meth-taurant!
15962,Homer,"barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
33142,Homer,"coming, marge!"
18417,Homer,nuts to that. i'm going to the movies.
36526,Homer,"oh, geez. not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
18840,Homer,"aw, hell. well... what about dracula?"
24184,Homer,"come on little friend, make a wisecrack. you know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."
40962,Homer,herbert. herbert powell. great! where can i find him?
40298,Homer,"sorry, honey. i'm just a little nervous."
19594,Homer,"you heard her. she said ""no."""
33658,Homer,"this is no time to pat the bunny, maggie. daddy's watching a very important mid-atlantic hockey league conference semi-final do-over game."
34673,Homer,"uh yes, i'd like... um... how do you say taco in mexican?"
36469,Homer,"great, we'll take care of everything. we'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners."
13404,Homer,whoa! holy mackerel!
34321,Homer,hey! you're supposed to be doing your homework! no more tv for you!
19837,Homer,"did you see that, marge?"
16866,Homer,shazam.
23643,Homer,yes it is. it's very good and you're a good little baby. yes you are.
32551,Homer,done.
30316,Homer,"rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! please, no rubes..."
36328,Homer,wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!
38810,Homer,wow.
37770,Homer,"oh, yes, i am shopping for maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
25550,Homer,africa? they're bound to have food there!
36868,Homer,could we at least agree to both hate flanders?
41403,Homer,and we're off!
24830,Homer,let's just say lisa gave me an early christmas present. the gift of dignity.
39000,Homer,you-- get-- out!
28258,Homer,"take care, ladies. i'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own."
40681,Homer,"gee, dad. way to hog my last moments."
24151,Homer,"no, i'm good."
37483,Homer,"sorry, lenny."
20211,Homer,"dad, what are you doin' here?"
23402,Homer,so we're all gonna die?
21211,Homer,attaboy!
27187,Homer,"well, that cinches it. lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response."
19713,Homer,i'm the worst poochie ever.
17582,Homer,"so, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
25946,Homer,so... it cost you nothin'.
14862,Homer,"i try, but i can't."
15311,Homer,he could still surprise ya!
35701,Homer,"i guess i'll get started before my family gets here. how much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
30464,Homer,"hello, domino's? what do you mean, you're not open? no, you call me back during business hours! i'll show you who's a recorded message!"
34614,Homer,"i like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
22242,Homer,"ooh, a friendly bee."
40238,Homer,"well, okay. it all started on ""nuclear plant employees, spouses, and no more than three children night,"" down at springfield stadium."
39271,Homer,"ah, son. one day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. receiving a big fat check for a job well done."
28093,Homer,"now i'm michael jackson. i own all your songs, losers. hee, hee, hee."
26279,Homer,kinda.
38835,Homer,this party's great. but all i wish is that i was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
14767,Homer,"wow, my concert going jacket still fits. and this is where i used to hide my beer."
13590,Homer,"stupid junk mail... ""you may have already won!"" yeah, win this... ""here's good news for homer simpsoy""... i'll see that he gets it. how dumb do they think i am?"
40435,Homer,"you know, his girlfriend is the weather lady."

32841,Homer,the food is all around us.

15987,Homer,oh. thanks.
21959,Homer,perfect.
33722,Homer,is it 'omplimentawee?
37153,Homer,"honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets."
37835,Homer,"as i always say, don't get mad, get dinner. then get even. with skinner."
38347,Homer,"come on! hug your grampa, boys!"

18593,Homer,"yeah, moe, that team sure did suck last night! they just plain sucked! i've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
24321,Homer,that's right.
28889,Homer,that woman means the world to me. would it be all right if i read from my bible?
22269,Homer,now it doesn't work.

29082,Homer,"actually, marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
25172,Homer,"man, that was a good apron expo."
23491,Homer,"all right, now don't panic. it's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."
24865,Homer,get out! who told you that?
15281,Homer,it's a pornography store. i was buying pornography.
39788,Homer,"just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
31028,Homer,i'm needed at the door!
34755,Homer,"they sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
22757,Homer,"'course not. there's no pain in the garden of eden. hey, you must be eve."
33899,Homer,"goodbye, fat me."
36549,Homer,woo hoo!
32718,Homer,wrong again.
18655,Homer,you owe me an apology!
36224,Homer,"so, what's on the agenda?"
36183,Homer,"hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we."""
32571,Homer,"it's okay -- we're not really your kids. we're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
20376,Homer,so this is the thanks i get for protecting my family? then go! i'll be just fine!
31009,Homer,"hey, check it out, i'm scratcher or something."
13295,Homer,"mmmmmm, donuts."
33796,Homer,must finish poet's corner... or bart will work for noah... with his hot mom...
16199,Homer,do you have a donut or not?
25107,Homer,point of order: i didn't lose all the money. there was enough left for this cowbell.
38897,Homer,what the?!
20243,Homer,stupid frog.
31200,Homer,"marge, could you let it go? you won. she's dead!"
31927,Homer,"okay, here's the solution -- i want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so i can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
31714,Homer,"marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. because i've got a plan..."
26367,Homer,just for twenty-five years.
18165,Homer,stop telling them it was me. i'll kill you for saying it was me.
22171,Homer,but it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. isn't that so?
18463,Homer,i'm sorry.
22185,Homer,"first of all, i get five dollars a day plus expenses."
40553,Homer,fifty percent?
25699,Homer,orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... lighting candles!
15516,Homer,bo-ring!
40179,Homer,"though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --"
24296,Homer,you came to the right guy. i'll straighten ya out... right after i finish this beer.
29407,Homer,"hey, it's a guy in a goofy burns head!"
23954,Homer,third best for me.
34730,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. don't you realize what just happened?"
38257,Homer,no penalty!
21049,Homer,what's a jib?
22047,Homer,"uh, excuse me, i'm fleeing in shame and i'd like to look my best."
16637,Homer,"yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
33359,Homer,no. yes.
14070,Homer,"moe, i haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
15246,Homer,"no ""all you can eat seafood."" i wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. nothing!"
40605,Homer,no!
20331,Homer,lousy big shot. thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
34342,Homer,we can't let bart drive us apart. he's the reason we had to get married.
40284,Homer,i shouldn't have called her that. bite my tongue. bite my tongue. oooh.
23775,Homer,oh no you don't!
26831,Homer,"fine, i won't kill it."
37136,Homer,"oh, it'll happen again, son."
30832,Homer,old man flanders!

25520,Homer,babies of springfield! we need your help! please! skin your knees! put dice up your nose! let cats sleep on your face!
19290,Homer,"let me finish. we could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
34983,Homer,"sorry, boss."
31564,Homer,"finally. something even i wouldn't eat. well, maybe a little more."
14212,Homer,"marge, there's something i want to ask you. but i'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
34090,Homer,back to the horses! back to the horses!
22948,Homer,"woo hoo! look at me, i can juggle!"
19258,Homer,"you know, i don't know."
32695,Homer,"mrs. simpson, may i take you for an evening drive? our loaner awaits!"
28349,Homer,"okay, what do i do?"
20562,Homer,that's a typo.
21898,Homer,heads up!
38487,Homer,eat your broccoli.
18808,Homer,you're on.
28904,Homer,my poor boy is miserable in here. there has to be something i can do to help him.
41055,Homer,"y'ello, hi, lisa, what's wrong? the mumps? oooh, the kissing disease! my little girl is growing up."
20801,Homer,"ooh, look a bird."
36655,Homer,on a poker site!
26379,Homer,do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? something indoorsy.
22245,Homer,"blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. the program is rock solid. the program is sound."
13525,Homer,who stole my shirt? who stole my shirt?
37188,Homer,"it's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
15306,Homer,it may be on a lousy channel but the simpsons are on tv!
14349,Homer,mm-hm.
14105,Homer,"moe, sorry i lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
38045,Homer,"all right, son... but you have to pay me back."
19654,Homer,but how am i supposed to pay for that?
16143,Homer,"marge, the comedy roast is an american tradition. it's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. hey flanders, you smell like manure!"
27951,Homer,"it's okay, bart. this track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh."
26369,Homer,"oh guys, it was horrible. i saw marge kissing a far superior man."
31303,Homer,"well, back to the drawing board."
38871,Homer,come on... come on... you son of a--
37639,Homer,"marge! get away from those freaks! you belong to me! the dumb, hairless brute!"
21126,Homer,i'm in.
31103,Homer,look at that line.
38711,Homer,all camping is pointless. you drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. i guess what i'm trying to say is: where's maggie?
24904,Homer,wuzzah?
28589,Homer,i'll assemble it myself.
14573,Homer,"they're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
32869,Homer,sit on a bench! sit on a bench!
39260,Homer,"so, what do you think kids? beauty, isn't it?"
17487,Homer,"some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! but now, i've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
40048,Homer,"a thousand bucks. of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! thanks for nothing!"
20760,Homer,good morning everybody.
41401,Homer,i need a ride to cub scouts.
24997,Homer,"now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man..."
33672,Homer,"this is it, maggie -- the place where daddy goes every morning."
24974,Homer,interesting.
28946,Homer,shut up! i didn't tell you to say that!
30890,Homer,"listen up, stonehenge. i made a drawing of the places on marge you can't touch. especially the hair."
32617,Homer,"marge, that was a joke!"
37726,Homer,stupid tallest building in springfield!
25142,Homer,"effigy, eh? yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. hey, that's me!"
14406,Homer,"look lisa, honey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings. but i really had a good time watching football with you. and i think you had a good time with me."
33282,Homer,bart?
26588,Homer,"mine keeps disappearing. oh, well."
28785,Homer,i am so there!
40116,Homer,five thousand two... i mean... lots of money.
24280,Homer,see? a new pacifier for maggie.
17872,Homer,"uh, could i just get a look at that?"
30378,Homer,and would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
39752,Homer,"whoop! don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. beauty, isn't she?"
23610,Homer,no. i don't want your pity or your money.
21541,Homer,"okay, turn on the suction."
40422,Homer,"come on, dad. let's get outta here."
13437,Homer,are you?
26529,Homer,"son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?"
20248,Homer,you should be.
17226,Homer,"well, okay. if it's fun. let's see..."
37912,Homer,"baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
25118,Homer,but i've had thousands of head x-rays. how come no one ever noticed it before?
15503,Homer,"bed goes up... kids, i want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. let's see... uh... oh, i'm no good at this."
21765,Homer,"c'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack."
31909,Homer,"i couldn't find maggie's brand, but i got every other kind i could find. how about ""syntho-nip?"""
13551,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons."
35423,Homer,fine.
16570,Homer,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
29182,Homer,"oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
34483,Homer,oh yeah. all the time. they say it's 'cause i'm overweight.
39554,Homer,"what did you do this time, you little hoodlum? oop. get out of the way."
25753,Homer,"yes, but then i discovered the joys of raising children."
21812,Homer,sure. we'll all stay.
39576,Homer,"marge, are you all right?"
17417,Homer,"ooh, ""portrait!"" sounds classy... doesn't it?"
21841,Homer,"oh, it was so great. i didn't have to fake it with them. i was actually excited to hear about their day."
36635,Homer,"exactly. well, we're all set. let's make a thad supersperm junior. with a name like that, he could be president."
30553,Homer,a little.
34604,Homer,"remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? well, now i can afford a motorcycle!"
31867,Homer,"oh, that's long gone, baby. long gone."
16176,Homer,right here.
23657,Homer,decided? that's classic. decided. babies just happen.
33307,Homer,"which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til i was hired to run it."
39148,Homer,"i see. you want excitement. princess, have you ever heard of studio fifty-four, c-b-g-bs, the roxbury?"
14502,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
25499,Homer,she will be.
40551,Homer,hey! lionel hutz...
33044,Homer,no problem.
41475,Homer,...unnecessarily big tvs?!
22755,Homer,heads up!
36800,Homer,to hope!
15011,Homer,sorry.
21703,Homer,you sent me to the chair.
19337,Homer,"good morning. you know, marge, i was thinking about how much i enjoy your interests, so i wandered over to that theater you went to last night. and i bought tickets to their entire season."
22942,Homer,"yeah, they're not great."
26056,Homer,"yes, mr. burns."
40475,Homer,"oh, hi, kids. thanks."
33826,Homer,tempting. tempting. where's the bathroom?
24394,Homer,"they called you a pig, sheriff."
16187,Homer,that's right.
13695,Homer,"hey, flanders. is everything okay?"
32789,Homer,"all right, that's it, pull over."
27707,Homer,you know everything about me!
36331,Homer,"the lava being! that's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""
28687,Homer,that one i got.
17684,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. there will be exactly enough money for you, me, bart and lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
38602,Homer,i know just the place.
33190,Homer,"sweet conclusions break-up service. oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented tenderdump system."
21874,Homer,"you know... i have no idea. hey, dad. what does the ""j"" stand for?"
25026,Homer,"anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. let's hit the hay."
18078,Homer,you did what?!!
40577,Homer,"marge, dear. would it be all right if i went over to moe's for a drink?"
14438,Homer,"well, all's well that ends well. goodnight, marge."
28578,Homer,i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am.
31016,Homer,"hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
15047,Homer,"how about you, barney?"
27053,Homer,couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
33511,Homer,will you kids knock it off? i'm trying to watch badminton!
18849,Homer,this has purple stuff inside. purple is a fruit.
20443,Homer,look at him go!
40461,Homer,"thanks, flanders. big know-it-all."
38134,Homer,"she's gone, honey. she's gone."
35533,Homer,why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?
31687,Homer,"just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish."
29705,Homer,"it wasn't easy, marge -- i've missed you so much."
15143,Homer,just promise me you'll try to be good.
30333,Homer,no soldier left behind.
33631,Homer,"but there is, marge! the first two letters..."
39016,Homer,"fine. we'll both go. and if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
31093,Homer,what about him?
29084,Homer,i thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
33010,Homer,now let it unfurl in your stomach.
37700,Homer,i wish.
29586,Homer,i know what i'm doing. you can use any section of the paper. except metro. it's a big snooze.
40142,Homer,don't be so stubborn! we're not talking about a few dollars! we're talking about a few thousand dollars!
25170,Homer,"did you say ""smockron""?"
36019,Homer,"that's right, sucker! it's valentine's day, and i've got a date with some fastballs!"
16786,Homer,huh?
27766,Homer,no deal!
20777,Homer,hmm. makes sense.
32051,Homer,"fine, cone."
26234,Homer,"peace, my people. all shall be looked up. let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. one hundred and sixteen."
41304,Homer,"uh-oh. if you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!"
20924,Homer,"hey! oh, no you don't!"
22716,Homer,"relax, boy. we're ahead of schedule."
14807,Homer,"tut tut, gentle marge. for here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
27041,Homer,"ah, i don't care about the color of your skin, lenny. you're my friend!"
17394,Homer,"c'mon, i'm a decent guy..."
14013,Homer,"oh, that sounds too complicated."
22695,Homer,"oh yes he will! and on time, too!"
30516,Homer,"yeah. now, i'm off to bring safety to springfield elementary and win back your love!"
13658,Homer,nah.
25860,Homer,what'd she say about cupcakes?
29462,Homer,that was me.
18468,Homer,"oh, i've missed moments like this... mom."
28084,Homer,why you little...
39620,Homer,yeah!
38251,Homer,it was pity-fridged!

13356,Homer,i slipped it into your glass as a gag.
33115,Homer,something something limbo something
37183,Homer,no. i'm sorry. it's... wait a minute.
23962,Homer,"oooh, oooh, charlie horse, charlie horse!"
30834,Homer,"no one turn on the sprinklers, okay?"
22512,Homer,this valentine's crap has gone too far.
22809,Homer,"okay, no big deal..."
26436,Homer,"it's just not fair. this buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
28856,Homer,no problem. we can still have fun without you drinking.
38121,Homer,"oh, it is so hard running in sand."
30107,Homer,but my prediction says--
39097,Homer,right here.
29787,Homer,hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot!
40221,Homer,"marge! don't worry. my daughter's very bright, i'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow."
30485,Homer,i was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. now let's go to bed.
29962,Homer,"c'mon, son. you can fight this. do the bartman. do the bartman!"
24202,Homer,"not bad, lisa junior. but god's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume."
36202,Homer,mom?!
24490,Homer,everybody wanted a piece of us.
31956,Homer,"yeah, we're awesome. this'll make a great toilet seat!"
38512,Homer,yeah...
26333,Homer,listen to all that revving!
16384,Homer,"bart, i'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!"
30570,Homer,"ladies. marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
18065,Homer,jazz. they just make it up as they go along. i could do that. dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
14578,Homer,"yes, sir!"
30266,Homer,"look, we've been down this road before. i do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles."
19490,Homer,"come here, people!"
16896,Homer,"wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
36245,Homer,"so, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
21271,Homer,"wait, shutup... i just thought of something!"
33382,Homer,"yes! i want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame."
29499,Homer,"oh, it's true. i don't know marge at all. i'll just go home now."
20062,Homer,"but, marge...!"
30557,Homer,"that's an excellent question, kent. first of all..."
17645,Homer,"brothers, i've learned a wonderful lesson. helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. so instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
15115,Homer,take that washington!
23469,Homer,"and for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... i'm down."
40242,Homer,what are you getting at?
18690,Homer,"uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your mom's done fitting in."
34915,Homer,now to take care of the witnesses.
34046,Homer,we're gonna be snore in the morning...
21650,Homer,"invent your way out of this, edison."
21220,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. put on a big show for the cameras."
40602,Homer,no.
31957,Homer,just what are you getting at?
22545,Homer,"ohhh, you suck, marge."
16651,Homer,what kind of catchphrase is that?
39060,Homer,gonna be a tight fit.
40064,Homer,"no, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye."
26029,Homer,lemons...
14387,Homer,"oh, violin guy!"
25625,Homer,give me back my thumb!
33728,Homer,"ooh, lemon. that'll stop the cherry."
32950,Homer,do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
38402,Homer,they all make good points.
32533,Homer,daddy...
39858,Homer,my back! there goes my back again!
40606,Homer,no!
36474,Homer,i'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
32853,Homer,who are you?
21470,Homer,"well, yeah, kinda..."
17188,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
33698,Homer,not a thing in the world.
34443,Homer,woo hoo!
34261,Homer,we're outta here.
22061,Homer,that's the last time i trust the strangest people on earth.
35643,Homer,"that's it! that's it! my nightmare is over! oh flanders, you are my personal savior!"
17988,Homer,"you can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom i built. remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
36770,Homer,the old stupid moustache'll win him over.
16899,Homer,"look at this, marge! fifty-eight dollars! and all of it profit! i'm the smartest businessman in the world!"
37370,Homer,"seriously, ""pews?"""
25324,Homer,"hey, leave my teammate alone!"
18039,Homer,"lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. you just go in every day and do it really half-assed. that's the american way."
16074,Homer,"hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?"
18248,Homer,"this barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but i'm sure you're up to it, marge."
34149,Homer,"""when i rode with abe simpson on the tinseltown starliner, i never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? at three o'clock on monday, abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
24793,Homer,baby made a boom-boom.
28995,Homer,"oh, right."

31371,Homer,"ohhh, don't forget. don't forget what?!"
25177,Homer,"that's not gonna do it, marge. you need something red."
17139,Homer,"that's because i've loaded it with sugar!!... marge, our ship has come in! i found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that i'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. and all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."

17799,Homer,"oh yeah. when i started this clown thing i thought it would be nothing but glory. you know, the glory of being a clown? i tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when i see the smiles on their little faces, i just know they're getting ready to jab me with something."
18274,Homer,"bart, go to your room!"
40699,Homer,"faster, barney, faster."
26290,Homer,"no marge, i love when you do that. you're a regular carin' a-lot-ovich."

37933,Homer,"one family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
24033,Homer,"nah, we're cool."
16958,Homer,"can i keep him anyway? huh, huh?"
27027,Homer,what game?
37886,Homer,"two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."

18548,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not."

28850,Homer,"hey, you do a great me, marge. you gotta show the guys at moe's."
21817,Homer,"a, uh... division of, um... homer-co."
26821,Homer,"marge, where's my pellet gun?"
16784,Homer,"why do you mock me, oh lord?"
17715,Homer,oh just that one time.
14060,Homer,"as i stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, i knew i needed a drink."
19919,Homer,"geez, that dog has more education than i do. he's some kinda super dog. hey, where'd he go?"
30628,Homer,"okay, so far i'm rootin' for ya."
34374,Homer,"you're halfway home, lady."
19216,Homer,"ooh, let's pick him up!"
37393,Homer,oh boy.
40326,Homer,"well, uh, okay. what the heck, i've earned a little break."
23965,Homer,"shut up, net face."
27794,Homer,"no, of course not!"
36374,Homer,"yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill."
40835,Homer,"""myth: cable piracy is wrong. fact: cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
19380,Homer,now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
19454,Homer,"yeah, that's me all right."
22727,Homer,"well, i'm not really a trucker, so i don't talk to the rep that often."
29158,Homer,"no, marge, there's one group that's always welcome in america: immigrants without i.d."
30243,Homer,"hey, i didn't bet any of our money. i just borrowed some from him."
33879,Homer,why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?
20871,Homer,i don't get it.
24637,Homer,that'll play great in the sticks.
23639,Homer,"well, all i care about is that my little girl loves me. and we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
37815,Homer,"hey, what's this marching band have to do with homer junior? what? there were cheerleaders in our house? and nobody told me?"
25206,Homer,"you brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
14633,Homer,"well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
15958,Homer,"run along, boy. you're free now!"
40710,Homer,the good book...
32313,Homer,here's your nose. daddy's putting back your nose.
40806,Homer,you said you'd go to the prom with me.

40250,Homer,examine my zipper? why? whoops!
32328,Homer,"ooo, an awesome accident! easy, easy... i'll just take three seconds to gawk. aw, everyone's okay."
27280,Homer,"wow, you don't even have to point it at him."
14906,Homer,"excuse me, marge. i think that if you told me i would remember! i mean i'm not an idiot!"
19959,Homer,i made a bad mistake and lenny sent me home to think about what i did. but i don't remember what it was so i'm watching tv.
18319,Homer,what's going on here? i'm so bulgy...
14535,Homer,"mmm, do - nuts."
39573,Homer,"you know marge, getting old is a terrible thing. i think the saddest day of my life is when i realized i could beat my dad at most things. and bart experienced that at the age of four. so why are you still awake?"
39937,Homer,"oh fantastic. marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. i was down at the kwik-e-mart minding my own business when... oooh oooh, ooh, the news."
35851,Homer,too late!
30078,Homer,"funny story, kent. it's the end of the world! god loves you! he's gonna kill you!"
36627,Homer,"um, i'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a simpson, homer. or it may be under the name thad supersperm."
18885,Homer,there. done and done.
32472,Homer,you better not make me cry. 'cause i don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
35451,Homer,boy! stomp on my head!
25580,Homer,"monkey. now, according to animal crackers, there's no river here."
30334,Homer,"lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
19859,Homer,really? i heard good.
26321,Homer,"dude, i thought we were friends."
30695,Homer,"mason, come see my room!"
25841,Homer,"yeah, she's cool."
20444,Homer,"exx-cellent poise, son. you panicked, but you didn't lose your cool."
35855,Homer,who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
32215,Homer,my pleasure.
27863,Homer,"you guys lead a fascinating life. like, why are you reading the new york times? you don't live in new york."
39923,Homer,"how you doin', apu?"
34095,Homer,point and shoot.
18132,Homer,i'm okay.
31059,Homer,okay. all it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
26196,Homer,"okay, but talk like this."
31348,Homer,"oh my god, i just remembered. it's chinese new year!"
41020,Homer,you think i work well with others?

15283,Homer,"kids! if we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
18306,Homer,"oh yeah? well it's my house, so it's my spot."
34996,Homer,ohhhh!
38900,Homer,i think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
18592,Homer,"ah, ha, ha, ha, god-boy couldn't get a strike."
32129,Homer,"well, i can see the position of handsomest c.e.o. is already taken."
33513,Homer,"so, after i paid for the ice cream cones, i said ""thank you"" and was on my way."
41433,Homer,i just wanted the woman i married.
18961,Homer,"for more information on grand funk, consult your school library!"
13915,Homer,i know you love me. so you don't get squat. hee hee hee hee.
29138,Homer,"there there, save your lies for the american public."
22638,Homer,no it's not.
31491,Homer,"lady, you're nice, but i'm married."
21871,Homer,"that was the problem. the important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, i'm finally getting some decent parts."
40920,Homer,but marge...
19887,Homer,i'll be right back.
25722,Homer,"two weeks?! well, what am i supposed to do? just sit on my ass and watch tv? that ain't my style, man!"
30458,Homer,"marge, i don't hate your mother. i just won't be sad when she dies. forty-seven, forty-eight..."
17242,Homer,"die, bad robots, die! with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero."

17759,Homer,"what's everyone so worked up about? so there's a comet. big deal. it'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
29464,Homer,i had to! or moe's would stay closed forever!
14559,Homer,"well, are you better than me?"
28818,Homer,i sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
40933,Homer,"heh heh heh. here we go. boy meets beast. principal skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, selma."
38358,Homer,"do you know how embarrassed i was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?"
20045,Homer,"well, basically i just copied the plant we have now..."
16062,Homer,"sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that i really should watch."
38968,Homer,"i'll eat in bed. not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... oh, and tv would be on. loud."
32739,Homer,go-go or boring?

29157,Homer,and here no one calls me a fat jerk... i'm a gourmand!
35439,Homer,hm. is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? maybe i can find the answer by texting.
41340,Homer,"lord, this is a dire emergency. if you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs..."

36401,Homer,you know... maybe i should call in sick. we could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary halloween stores.
26575,Homer,"look marge, i'm brazilian."
22690,Homer,so much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
13774,Homer,"look, i get enough admiration and respect at work. i don't need it here at home."
18725,Homer,"yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
27148,Homer,i bet you would.
16498,Homer,the sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.
20492,Homer,then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
41135,Homer,"all right, everybody stick together. we don't want to get separated..."
26425,Homer,"eh, i'm sick of this tarzan movie."
29306,Homer,"and lisa, what have you learned?"
36403,Homer,"my feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
33835,Homer,the heat is off. the hissing from the radiator is a snake.
21818,Homer,"and lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back..."
21565,Homer,oh. i see you're having a party. i'll come back later.
23958,Homer,i don't wanna!
16267,Homer,"how can you do this, marge? how can you desert your children?"
17299,Homer,"oh no! they're gaining on me. wait, i have an idea."
32708,Homer,"oh boy, dinner time! the perfect break between work and drunk."
33992,Homer,"well, we're not going out to help him. we have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!"
25853,Homer,"hey, we stayed for your kids!"
26500,Homer,stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. piece of crap...
39027,Homer,"be my guest, but i seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em."
16278,Homer,two.
16888,Homer,that bird! he's killing the elephant! stop him!
18653,Homer,"hey, bush! get out here!"
33140,Homer,okay.
14961,Homer,i know that!
34250,Homer,you have a right to be angry. furious! and even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
22183,Homer,let's do it.
13272,Homer,moooooe... you killed meeeee.
18140,Homer,"here's your package, mr. burns!"
30099,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. let's go to moe's. we'll walk and punch.
25241,Homer,"oh, the whole deal. coffin. tombstone. anti-stink spray."
18028,Homer,ooh... this time... ah...
21981,Homer,that's my girl!
28051,Homer,i can walk from springfield to alaska / then hobnob with the stars in malibu...
22535,Homer,lousy message.
25450,Homer,they're secretly planning to move to albuquerque.
36593,Homer,a reason? what could it be?
17251,Homer,"oh, sideshow bob."
28793,Homer,"hey, i paid for this popcorn and i'm eating it."
33018,Homer,"i can't believe flanders dumped me. marge, do we have any more of your extra-long twinkies?"
32882,Homer,mom!
29130,Homer,"oh, cold shoulder, huh? well, i'll just talk to myself. hey, how ya doin', homer? oh, not too bad, how about you? oh i'm fine. your wife was great in bed last night. you keep your hands off my wife! oh yeah? well i give her what she needs. and she likes..."
27017,Homer,flanders?! a perfect vacation ruined.
39509,Homer,ah. say no more.
20890,Homer,"hey, i thought your mother told you to take a bath."
22265,Homer,especially me.
26826,Homer,"certainly, lenford. make every day a celebration of your love. surprise her with a pasta salad! put a mini-beret on your wang!"
34287,Homer,"ooo, you're mad when you're angry..."
40805,Homer,"thanks, mr. b."
39244,Homer,what do you mean? all the time? even when they're nuts?
18456,Homer,"damn you, walt whitman! i... hate... you... walt... freakin'... whitman! ""leaves of grass"" my ass! wait a minute. maybe it's that other grave. the one that says ""simpson."""
36040,Homer,"it's fun, but not as fun."
32560,Homer,"aw, i landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them."
13214,Homer,d'oh!
29459,Homer,... marge?
26757,Homer,this was supposed to be a mock battle! mock!
25096,Homer,you heard the monkey -- make the trade.
37773,Homer,excuse me.
26383,Homer,marge?!
21319,Homer,not there either. over here.
26836,Homer,"oh fine, i'll go back to the beginning."
39739,Homer,"oh, no. come on, come on! open up!"
38231,Homer,"ah, brazil. i couldn't stay afraid of you forever. the only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. that is a deal breaker."
21852,Homer,"ooh, look at me! i'm kim basinger, the big movie star! i'm so beautiful! i think i'm so great! i'm too important to take homer to the oscars."
32285,Homer,"marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
34572,Homer,bad dog! stop!
16753,Homer,"marge, i don't really want to go through with this... but being an astronaut is how i got you to respect me."
25877,Homer,cobras!
37717,Homer,"well, we've gotta do it! i never leave a job unfinished. it's as true now as that week i worked on the high school yearbook. so much infighting. i had to get outta there!"
23060,Homer,i don't have time for that.
32242,Homer,throw my hands up and
39879,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'. the lek?
15529,Homer,heh-heh. kids.
31331,Homer,you? don't make me laugh! you couldn't--
23074,Homer,hmmm...
22521,Homer,not entirely.
32588,Homer,a surprise party?
32271,Homer,i would love to! but i don't have a tow truck.
32889,Homer,well i'm not going to digest it!
36819,Homer,"get lost, pervs!"
33516,Homer,"well, i can't compete with that!"
19821,Homer,"you like parties, huh? well, i just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
33053,Homer,"you better settle down, boy, or i'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera..."
27056,Homer,and that's why you're my favorite.
37190,Homer,why you little! that's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
31690,Homer,he loves it!
31403,Homer,"oh, jemima!"
23574,Homer,"yes, the girl bart has a crush on."
14275,Homer,"thanks, mom."
21023,Homer,but only if you're good. even if you're not.
17263,Homer,i'll kill you! i'll kill all of you!
26635,Homer,"oh my god, this dude does the best flanders! you got the mustache and the didilly... okay, now do wiggum."
41584,Homer,"ketchup, please."
37683,Homer,my boy's okay!
22253,Homer,"but amber, i can change!"
26408,Homer,"yeah, one time, she-- oh, she's looking at us. be cool."
26405,Homer,"look, boy. here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
15258,Homer,"no, that's not it. what's his name? the man of la mancha."
31554,Homer,"oh, they're getting a little exercise."
33213,Homer,no.
29033,Homer,"maybe you're right, lisa. maybe you're pie. pie-be you're pie."
20360,Homer,or would i?
19988,Homer,"well, it was a good ride while it lasted. c'mon kids. let's go home."
22722,Homer,"i whole-heartedly-agree. oh-man-i'm-really-wired. this-is-a-big-mistake-i-can... ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. so drowsy. pep-pills-perking-up-again. i-could-drive allll niiight..."
20796,Homer,"wow, a free movie. thanks! outta my way, jerk ass."
18853,Homer,"boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
36087,Homer,"well, i rented that plane."
26694,Homer,and life just gets more exciting.
34284,Homer,can i help you with that?
37604,Homer,weird thing under a tarp.
28671,Homer,"ooh, typed!"
39967,Homer,oops.
37802,Homer,"okay, i've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. the sky is blue, but no one really knows why. don't believe what they tell you. girls are great and terrible at the same time. get used to it. and, most importantly-- oops, we're here. you'll have to figure it out on your own."
24434,Homer,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
39648,Homer,"and remember not to act afraid. animals can smell fear. and they don't like it. besides, there's nothing to be afraid of."
29043,Homer,we shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
37304,Homer,"and uh, how was your day?"
37509,Homer,"okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
18835,Homer,"you know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? why i heard..."
36933,Homer,"well, that's just the way dogs are. the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made."
37399,Homer,i know c.p.r.
15082,Homer,that's good.
33364,Homer,al gore?
23411,Homer,sh-sh-shh!
28225,Homer,"give me a hug, you."
22085,Homer,get out of there!
13842,Homer,you both toilet-trained?
35925,Homer,"take that, centers of art and commerce. and this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. that's right, i'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!"
34646,Homer,the ferry will be back in ten minutes. it'll take us home... to find out the truth.
39254,Homer,you both look well.
17000,Homer,what? it's not magaggie's birthday? oh.
17546,Homer,you'll be picking many a bean.
32827,Homer,have you got lou in your car?
24663,Homer,"huh? oh, right."
24814,Homer,i see what you're saying -- i need to buy a gun.
20599,Homer,oh yeah.
24142,Homer,"jebus, where are you?! homer to jebus!"
38155,Homer,this dude gets it.
36445,Homer,whee! whee!
20138,Homer,sorry.
28559,Homer,you can't change the rules in the middle of the game! we never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. promises were made!
15843,Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. there and there. don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. now, some aftershave."
25608,Homer,"here, little fella."
32591,Homer,"don't worry honey, i'll get you an ice pack. where's the ice pack?"
20060,Homer,"it's not a plant, marge, it's a tree, and i've nearly chewed through it. now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
22008,Homer,can't stop now. we're making great time.
39736,Homer,it's my birthday? what did i get? i love birthdays.
37981,Homer,the rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
34911,Homer,"hey, show some respect. three gingerbread workmen died making that."
28058,Homer,"it's okay, marge. it would have been a lot worse if i hadn't been carrying this bible in my crotch."
21767,Homer,life jackets?
35742,Homer,"yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript."
24636,Homer,big grins!
29427,Homer,oh wait. i was supposed to take these with food.
22540,Homer,"well, i think i have a collapsed lung, but okay!"
27997,Homer,what has he done for me lately?
14579,Homer,huh?
20851,Homer,"uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. that's why i need a name that's cutting edge, like cutco... or edgecom... interslice... come on, marge -- you're good at these. help me out."
26276,Homer,"oh, you mean tennessee?"
13498,Homer,"so a few people won't get a few letters. boo-hoo. you know the kinda letters people write: ""dear somebody-you-never-heard-of... how is so-and-so? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. yours truly, some bozo."" big loss."
19344,Homer,marge? can you come in here? we need to talk.
21200,Homer,"i never apologize, lisa. i'm sorry, but that's just the way i am."
39005,Homer,um...
41194,Homer,"oooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
18396,Homer,"pro: i, uh... don't have to go to work."
35122,Homer,i do keep it together.
26158,Homer,got it.
24728,Homer,"so, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?"
15127,Homer,i did. i did read to her!
23142,Homer,"you had me at ""hello."""
19609,Homer,uh-oh.
36746,Homer,"yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now."
20146,Homer,thanks for your patience!
32565,Homer,bring it on.
25527,Homer,in the cart.
37845,Homer,"now, i'm afraid it's time to start your new life. you'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. so avoid mirrors."
23458,Homer,now we're talkin'!
20697,Homer,even the criminals are beginning to croon.
25926,Homer,you're right. it's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
29243,Homer,uh-oh.
27990,Homer,everything is going according to plan. i'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
39497,Homer,unortho what?
33387,Homer,i don't feel much like eating. i'll never know what would've happened if i'd have been class president.
31421,Homer,and now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
35683,Homer,"when i'm sad, i make baseball bats."
39166,Homer,there was beer involved. i have two daughters. and i've learned you have to let them go their own way. even the one-year-old.
17569,Homer,"hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
39993,Homer,"ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
33262,Homer,the power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
29030,Homer,"aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down."
20411,Homer,"yeah, homer again. i think we got cut off. y'ello?"
27106,Homer,never!
22961,Homer,a sober irishman?
21418,Homer,"oh, so now it's we, eh."
13432,Homer,are you?
36533,Homer,why you little... where's that ice cream?
41461,Homer,they're too big to fail.
37458,Homer,"the power of friendship is so amazing, i don't feel at all suspicious of carl."
18765,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!!"
38659,Homer,a boxing glove!
21596,Homer,"what? eh. eh. let me handle the creative end of this, marge. you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do."
17493,Homer,we're both screw-ups.
33585,Homer,have one more beer at o'flanagan's pub... we'll do that one!
20745,Homer,"i was trying to, but the opportunity never came up."
35658,Homer,i won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
26521,Homer,this truly is hell!
40205,Homer,"you know, i was just telling the wife that if i was governor, i'd do things a lot differently."
29910,Homer,"yes he does. he's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! you'll see!"
29319,Homer,huh? huh?
21506,Homer,"uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
39588,Homer,excuse me. i think i hear my wife calling.
18865,Homer,"all right, dare."
29441,Homer,really? in america we do it four times a week. you come on down and i'll get us front row seats.
38805,Homer,gimme another one.
26001,Homer,not for friends of moe's.
21861,Homer,"well, i'll always have my crank calls. hello, old lady from ""titanic""? you stink!"
17475,Homer,get out.
40670,Homer,"dad, we've never been too close, have we?"
35678,Homer,"pine needle... sorbet... pine needle sorbet!! my kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!"
15545,Homer,"stick your head out the window, boy. it's the greatest!"
24520,Homer,rocks!
15191,Homer,the half-assed approach to foundation repair.
29339,Homer,"why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... i'll fix your wagon!"
33125,Homer,"all marge and i need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""do not disturb"" sign."
40496,Homer,"goodbye, son."
33847,Homer,foam wasn't spilt in a day.
37466,Homer,i just need to get closer.
17025,Homer,how dare you call me that?!
35876,Homer,try to catch one on your tongue.
18422,Homer,"shame on all of you. give me my dignity! i just came here to see ""honk if you're horny"" in peace."
33569,Homer,"that was good, but lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
38989,Homer,"you know, boy, i'm not sure i can strangle you anymore. i'm gonna try something new."
29764,Homer,that's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
18546,Homer,"marge, is lisa at camp granada?"
18242,Homer,aww.
24111,Homer,why are you torturing me? i'm just a man.
33840,Homer,you make words into dudes.
40665,Homer,"heh-heh. the joke's on him, i'll be dead by then."
22573,Homer,"back! back, i say!"
35482,Homer,"um... uh... so uh, joey, is wikipedia accurate when it says ""walk this way"" was inspired by ""young frankenstein?"""
23467,Homer,"oh, a little bit of everything."
17923,Homer,"look, all i ask is that you be fair."
28367,Homer,"yeah, i love sprawl-mart. they've got everything. even christian videos with talking vegetables."
40576,Homer,"no, thank you."
21349,Homer,forget it. i'll be at the top by noon. over and out.
26996,Homer,we're out of donuts!
22246,Homer,"oh, those awful women want their omelettes."
27015,Homer,"oh my god! she's become a monster! which i have to admit, i sort of suspected during the sex."
24165,Homer,"i guess so, but that first month was pretty rough."
31501,Homer,the end.
29258,Homer,"oh, now you tell me."
31803,Homer,"now maggie, i had to use your car seat to hold the new tv guide...so i'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
34772,Homer,"you're safe now, my friend."
25348,Homer,sorry.
19913,Homer,"marge, mail's here."
36515,Homer,"...and five hundred dollars for yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus..."
23650,Homer,"kids are the best, apu. you can teach them to hate the things you hate. and they practically raise themselves, what with the internet and all."
32911,Homer,it works on so many levels.
15623,Homer,"no, you haven't! you've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! haven't you, haven't you. look at me."
39949,Homer,ahhhh!
29927,Homer,not real.
16901,Homer,"um, milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. right?"
17285,Homer,get it off! get it off! get it offf!!
33077,Homer,"all around the something world,"
26794,Homer,whee! whee!
40195,Homer,"oh, man. plain cake donuts? thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. why can't i ever get here on time?"
24643,Homer,woo hoo!
28701,Homer,in marge's book i was so mean and you were so nice. how can i be more like you? just give me some advice.
39109,Homer,"twenty-three?! people, for god's sake, join a gym."
29909,Homer,ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
24785,Homer,you're the boss.
30196,Homer,"how can we afford any of these private schools? they're all so expensive. if we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get grampa that new pacemaker?"
30271,Homer,oh-my-darling-i-love-you-please- forgive-me.
17500,Homer,jokes on them. i'm still alive.
39220,Homer,"what is it, flanders?"
31911,Homer,wanna suck on the receipt?
30081,Homer,"here's one -- revelation 6:13. just before the rapture, ""the stars will fall to the earth."" so all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
37381,Homer,church bulletin? church bulletin? find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. the answer may shock you.
38360,Homer,"hey, i created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
33278,Homer,everyone get out!
31941,Homer,any moment...
19898,Homer,i filled the balls with a funnel.
29051,Homer,or should i?
22582,Homer,"oh, no! she's not gonna make it!"

34676,Homer,stop! stop! stop!
18055,Homer,"lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?"
20792,Homer,will there be beer?
14416,Homer,buffalo's gonna win. lisa hates me!
22649,Homer,"sure they are, honey."
29503,Homer,"listen, i gotta tell ya, i chew in my sleep."
17412,Homer,under the sea / under the sea / there'll be no accusations / just friendly crustaceans / under the sea.
30391,Homer,"y'ello? no, i'm not coming into work. i have chicken pox. i know i said that last month, but i was lying."
40042,Homer,i was right.
41219,Homer,it's a deal!
20615,Homer,"ooo, gumball."
34888,Homer,"dearly beloved. i'd like to open this service with the words of emily dickinson: ""hope is the thing with feathers..."""
20565,Homer,"okay, folks. get your angel glow sticks! no one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
17371,Homer,they wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
18834,Homer,"yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
17588,Homer,i'd give anything to get into the stonecutters.
39569,Homer,you just clack as loud as you want. lis.
33251,Homer,"okay, i'll apologize."
16817,Homer,hey everyone!

19948,Homer,"you're welcome, honey."
30817,Homer,'cause he wants it.
34117,Homer,"no, you said ""naked bacon."""
25792,Homer,what are you gonna do to us?
30403,Homer,you're not saying no.
27346,Homer,"lisa, nobody likes a shill."
31931,Homer,zombie file grievance.
15121,Homer,"all right, i'll talk to lisa's teacher this year. you can have bart's."
28939,Homer,wait a minute. i thought you didn't wanna get married.
13844,Homer,huh? what?
37916,Homer,forever!
28657,Homer,"slow down, picasso! you were gonna start a novel without informing me?"
21062,Homer,very well then. i'm a captain.
38523,Homer,"my one weakness: the third ""really."" come with me."
32209,Homer,"eh, i'll think about it."
13654,Homer,the fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
36448,Homer,does jesus have a big part in this thing?
23518,Homer,"thank god, there's one left!"
27030,Homer,you guys are nuts. all you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do i sign up?
17654,Homer,"but marge, knightboat. the crime solving boat."
37409,Homer,got anything for a man my size?
30654,Homer,"okay, christmas, christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a christmas card with his home address on it? what's up with that?"
15111,Homer,to the book depository!
15598,Homer,i'm on my way!
19007,Homer,"but the main thing is, i've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
38962,Homer,"'cause if i'm sick, i get to stay home and make s'mores. all i need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
17633,Homer,remove the girl.
28813,Homer,and the peanuts in your mouth.
36751,Homer,"aw, come on chief, i've had a rotten day. can't you help me out?"
21964,Homer,"that means that you weigh... one hundred and sixty pounds! oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!"
39551,Homer,okay. here we go.
24739,Homer,mmm... donuts.
33554,Homer,catholics!
40865,Homer,"yeah, friday night. you want to come over?"
35320,Homer,"when we get home, the peaches will be gone."
33440,Homer,"i won't be insured until three o'clock?! okay, until then, i have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or i'm ruined."
36761,Homer,i don't wanna.
13757,Homer,who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
30618,Homer,it says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
33836,Homer,that's another twenty or thirty years.
26192,Homer,cooperate?! this is one family that doesn't swing that way.
35344,Homer,dammit!
13828,Homer,"yeah, but i gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... yeah, that's what it is. wanna try it? heh, heh, heh."
15476,Homer,uh... some dog could do the operation.
21889,Homer,"get off, you stupid dog!"
36919,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll be nicer to the dude. i've just never really been a dog person."
40540,Homer,he's awake!
19685,Homer,"oh, that poor woman."
22859,Homer,"all right, how about a million?"
41161,Homer,"great, fine, go nuts!"
30983,Homer,may i escort you to the railing?
35270,Homer,bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
38014,Homer,what else is marge hiding from me?
19728,Homer,give her a break! her husband was killed!
23395,Homer,"well, son. i guess this is the end. but we've both had long, full lives. oh, right."
38540,Homer,"careful, marge, that's how i bankrupted a pizza hut."
17882,Homer,that was in the third grade.
24163,Homer,here we go. ee-yeah.
17444,Homer,oh. all right.
28883,Homer,feed my pets and tape my shows!
15537,Homer,woo-hoo!
30577,Homer,i wish. i made these at work.
25650,Homer,"i'm sorry. i thought he was a party robot, like in that play i wrote."
35319,Homer,"honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, i booked us a couples massage."
16063,Homer,i hate that lousy dean!
36315,Homer,"c'mon, boy. we've gotta go home. i saved big bucks on the delivery charges."
33973,Homer,what'd i miss?
29041,Homer,"let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
17369,Homer,"sorry kids, but this is one event i want my darling wife by my side."
40617,Homer,there's gotta be something i haven't tried. huh? hey! what's this? fugu!
17496,Homer,"i'm with you, dad."
33990,Homer,no holds barred.
13836,Homer,i'm not nodding. it's the air conditioning.
39517,Homer,"tough day at school, boy?"
36589,Homer,"i gotta hand it to you, marge. you got the exact amount of car for our family. room for two adults, three kids, and zero grampas."
37012,Homer,white rice or brown?
36056,Homer,"eh, i'm sick of watching fox. let's get some fresh air. i got the atv's right out back."
13511,Homer,"hey, c'mon, joey! do you have to twist my arm?"
28496,Homer,i'm upside down so much!
34415,Homer,"ned! ned, wait up!"
35602,Homer,why you little!... /
28632,Homer,"bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside."
35459,Homer,i thought i was.
17334,Homer,i mean my little girl buddy.
36334,Homer,and where will i watch tv?
28079,Homer,"tonight, we're here to serve you. sit back and enjoy the finest foods springfield has to offer."
32026,Homer,i wanna get us all in the picture this time. closer.
13840,Homer,"oh, ah, thanks boy."
30135,Homer,"thank you, lord! it's back the way it was."
34696,Homer,"wow, marge. i can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar."
38258,Homer,"well, at least i'll die the american way. in a foreign country wearing short pants."
31405,Homer,i thought we were playing cincinnati time-waste.
29239,Homer,"oh c'mon, marge. it's not fair to compare us to an american household."
27204,Homer,let's go get fried chicken!
17673,Homer,"sorry, that just slipped out. i'll miss ya."
30220,Homer,right. and how do i join? do i whale on some unitarians?
37847,Homer,someday i may have to fake my own death. and maybe you can help me with that.
37907,Homer,"i now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""cosmic wars episode seven""."
26532,Homer,wow.
25416,Homer,wait a minute. four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
17790,Homer,kill wealthy dowager.
31540,Homer,i've never seen marge want to go somewhere so badly. i'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a dvd.
22337,Homer,"yeah, it's a good group."
39035,Homer,does that drone do date nights with the wife?
31284,Homer,"if he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"
16515,Homer,"marge, i'm taking the car."
24945,Homer,"okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding."
34097,Homer,"you had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""
38079,Homer,overfed? i don't know this word.
30590,Homer,i gotta stop marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
20280,Homer,"good night, losers!"
27930,Homer,"all right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble native americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
27011,Homer,"what's up, honey? want a little lovin'?"
29260,Homer,"get lost, crook!"
27373,Homer,my name is homer simpson. and i desperately need your help.
22763,Homer,"no problem, lord. and it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if i had a few extra wives."
20594,Homer,you're the boss.
36692,Homer,that's dad's cologne? i always thought it was his old-man stink.
15487,Homer,who are you donating them to?
40384,Homer,"read that back to me, marge."
22939,Homer,"thanks, noodles."
17709,Homer,thank you. thank you very much. it is nice work.
22052,Homer,i've been on that one. the taffy shop.
32643,Homer,what i did made the tv thing happen.
20856,Homer,can i have some money now?
13858,Homer,uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
13547,Homer,that's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. they're gonna eat it.
19897,Homer,"you forgot one thing, wiggum."
16807,Homer,"wow, thanks. now i have four children. you will be called ""stitch-face."" wow, flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
34514,Homer,i have an idea. but i must go alone. my car is filled with printer paper i stole from work.
14855,Homer,twenty minutes?!
13767,Homer,"eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... eenie meenie minee... moe."
21411,Homer,"closed, eh? so getting in would be a pretty big risk. what do you say, honey? feeling stupid? i know i am."
30887,Homer,i'll bet the twist is he's gay.
29740,Homer,"i'm sorry, moe. marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
19787,Homer,"butt out, butt-insky! what would you know about hunting?"
24892,Homer,"oh, don't worry about the mr. x thing. i'm just here for a beer."
24550,Homer,"well, the thing about that is..."
21360,Homer,"this may not be the top, but it's as close as a simpson's ever gonna get."
26976,Homer,"no, you've got chores to do."
28882,Homer,my demons and i are closer than ever. next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. i'm just goin' in to bust marge out.
16056,Homer,son of sniglets??
17784,Homer,hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
14760,Homer,"oh, would you two knock it off? i hate all the programs marge likes. but it's no big deal. you know why?"
29563,Homer,"quiet, you!"
13435,Homer,are you?
15064,Homer,hey... hey!
27940,Homer,"quick, find the master log! there's always a master log."
41115,Homer,"well... sure. we'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. bart!"
29555,Homer,the children of god once lived according to their father's laws.
32808,Homer,lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. why can't i leave for thirty years?
24979,Homer,"what have you done, you clumsy little ox?! that cake was for your deaf sister!"
28184,Homer,y'ello?
38109,Homer,i'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
15630,Homer,pepi!
32757,Homer,"that wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
17340,Homer,"okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, i want to make a few things clear."
23634,Homer,maggie! call aquaman!
25104,Homer,family meeting! family meeting!
38712,Homer,"uh, listen here, desert arnaz. homer simpson knows how to pitch a tent."
28837,Homer,and i know just where to find him. 742 evergreen terrace.
24742,Homer,"marge, she's gonna narc on our stash."
40973,Homer,by any chance does the h stand for herbert?
24453,Homer,"oh, here we go with the add ons. no thanks."
26137,Homer,"just a second, son. i've gotta put on my contacts."
18271,Homer,"marge, tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like i do every morning."
26680,Homer,and now a man you will see is definitely not dead... mr. montgomery burns!
26959,Homer,"aw, she's taking a nap."
28279,Homer,but i'm up two hundred thousand dollars! give me my money!
33872,Homer,"thanks, marge. but don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit."
34851,Homer,"your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. so, by the power vested in me, i now pronounce you sweet dreams."
39809,Homer,hmmm... still got it!
23661,Homer,"now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy."
39156,Homer,get outta here!
21902,Homer,what is this place?
30805,Homer,"boy, come here and listen to lisa's story. it's about moe's treasure!"
40018,Homer,"i'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. well as long as i'm here, i might as well kill two birds with one stone."
37267,Homer,"you may be the sweater man, but homer is the better man."
29137,Homer,"talk about boats! then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't."
28239,Homer,"dad, you testified against her!"
30197,Homer,get 'em from the smoke detector.
15038,Homer,oh my god!
34314,Homer,a little!
18994,Homer,i'll never be part of the scene again!
27176,Homer,... and that's how my beautiful wife brought our son bart into the world.
29845,Homer,oopsie.
31033,Homer,"ooh! marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?"
40982,Homer,oh.
22275,Homer,championship?
41293,Homer,"okay homer, don't speak. if you must make a sound, whistle."
26124,Homer,never!
29867,Homer,a sign!
24343,Homer,"hi, kids!"
23528,Homer,cash'll be okay! or stock? does your company have stock?
35129,Homer,"is my job creating power, empowering?"
18058,Homer,"remember, honey?"
27784,Homer,quit crowding the plate!
21217,Homer,"but this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. and i'm going to get it back. lisa, do i have my pants on?"
15482,Homer,kids. kids... i'm not gonna die. that only happens to bad people.
30540,Homer,hmmm. i will run for mayor!
16007,Homer,"oh. i wrote that one, after bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt."
24931,Homer,what a horrible four months. now to warn everybody.
33565,Homer,"no, marge. you're the most giving person i know. besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne."
32826,Homer,"okay, they bought it."
24414,Homer,"the only thing we can do. sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
30095,Homer,wait for it... wait for it...
39553,Homer,ohhh... get out of the corner!
13163,Homer,i found this stone earlier. i was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but i want you to have it.
30656,Homer,"oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... i'd like to tell you all a little story i call ""the first christmas."""
34677,Homer,that is disgusting.
26867,Homer,"now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... does that ever work?"
32463,Homer,"all for you, baby."
25564,Homer,what did you just see?
22567,Homer,i've seen plays that were more exciting than this. honest to god. plays.
32664,Homer,"and one moonlit night, i finally had fun at a mini-golf course."
38970,Homer,yeah. thank god that never happened.
25940,Homer,"i hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her."
36995,Homer,"creepy? marge, the apocalypse is coming. maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
16762,Homer,and that is that.
30800,Homer,i'm bald!
13201,Homer,why not?
22027,Homer,really? you think it's dangerous?
29000,Homer,never!
15086,Homer,"happy birthday, son!"
39408,Homer,"stay here, i'll be right back."
15557,Homer,"now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
13245,Homer,"hear me, people of springfield. i come from yet another distant future where gun violence has destroyed the very earth itself."
28289,Homer,"lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. and when you do, people will remember you. just look at these postage stamps."
28819,Homer,don't tell my kids i'm going to jail! tell them i've joined the blue man group! i'm the fat one!
38389,Homer,fat tony's horse is gay!
22996,Homer,uh... geraldo... simpson.
40029,Homer,hmmm...
34305,Homer,"the library? bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?"
15088,Homer,didn't even pull the string that time.
19472,Homer,"oh, honey, i didn't get drunk. i just went to a strange fantasy world. c'mon, you gotta believe me. you're my soul mate."
17471,Homer,"dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? maybe i could've been something more than i am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
26858,Homer,"marge, i can't say no to a helpless old lady. they put spells on you!"
25888,Homer,"oh, son. you know that's none of your business. say, is that our house?"
26358,Homer,"this round's on me, moe. i got a big payday comin'."
18642,Homer,"wait a minute. if lisa didn't vote for him, and i didn't vote for him--"
26971,Homer,outstanding.
16317,Homer,"kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
37637,Homer,son-of-a!
21056,Homer,"ooh, comfy."
35833,Homer,"everything's a rip-off of ""the honeymooners."" margie, you're the greatest."
24731,Homer,"take that, lisa's beliefs."
41122,Homer,"a double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for god's sakes, hurry!"
32380,Homer,"hop in, bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
14724,Homer,"marge, it takes two to lie. one to lie and one to listen."
19528,Homer,"no, i'm sorry."
17336,Homer,"okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, i'll kill you."
22466,Homer,sure you can. buncha no-good do-gooders.
37544,Homer,it's in drugtown. not the nice part.
16916,Homer,he took bart too?
38072,Homer,"uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. you know, dweebler."
38787,Homer,nothing's gonna stop me now.
28205,Homer,"too soon, huh?"
33051,Homer,"oh, uh, she's uh..."
24320,Homer,barney.
29330,Homer,"good news, marge!"
14881,Homer,"now, bart. we made this deal because i thought it would help you get good grades. and you didn't. but why should you pay for my mistake?"
24123,Homer,"maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in springfield are simple folk. we like our cars fast, and our banks closed. okay, fine, we'll go down there. but they're not going to be open."
21219,Homer,"don't come off all high and mighty with me, patterson. you can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
30920,Homer,"y'ello. you want my opinion on current movies?! well, first of all, they're all perfect. also: when's the cap'n crunch movie coming out? and will it be ""r"" or ""hard r""?"
35902,Homer,"now, i may not be some mani-pedied tv blowhard..."
20895,Homer,hi sweetie. i'm off to moe's. love ya.
23715,Homer,how could i be down a thousand bucks?
13884,Homer,no wonder she hates me. i never even noticed that she was alive.
23285,Homer,"okay, start the presses!"
14577,Homer,got it.
18014,Homer,"my ""best of ray stevens featuring the streak"" album! so it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
14962,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson."
29300,Homer,i thought you two broke up.
40534,Homer,"marge, get the door."
39945,Homer,okay.
41413,Homer,"you watch your mouth, you little smartass."
35645,Homer,"congratulations, roz."
31568,Homer,so that means... it is opposite day.
38353,Homer,whoa. that's a bit of a woo-hoo. indeed.
37094,Homer,"too late! you already signed! oh wait, there's one more."
24231,Homer,whatever.
32096,Homer,i wanna be back on the plane.
13960,Homer,"oh no! what is it, a hippopotamus!"
32135,Homer,look happy.
28215,Homer,wait a minute. this is today's paper. that meeting is tonight!
33661,Homer,wha-wha-what's the score?!
13649,Homer,"don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. marge simpson... president of the international we love flanders fan club..."
21737,Homer,"this little piggy went to kwik-e-mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--"
15775,Homer,"you know, you could have just called me."
14816,Homer,"forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
31631,Homer,"oh, right -- revenge!!"
16362,Homer,steak?
36653,Homer,"it's a classy operation. see, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. cute."
32018,Homer,"oh, i'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!"
23932,Homer,"havin' a party, moe. i'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
25327,Homer,i think he's trying to psych you out.
34643,Homer,"i was there when your wife got to moe's, being my usual effervescent self..."
40930,Homer,"but if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?"
14768,Homer,billy beer!
39378,Homer,why not? i think after all these years i deserve an explanation.
31549,Homer,i bet it was bill clinton's fault.
18004,Homer,see? you're still helping me.
28352,Homer,"boy, a krispy kreme would really clean up down here."
33547,Homer,yo! over here!
36043,Homer,we won! woo hoo!
38216,Homer,ooh!
32182,Homer,will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
33157,Homer,so that wasn't marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! i'm getting out of this marriage while i'm still young and handsome.
35012,Homer,he took me to a fight that he fixed. but he never let on. not even when i bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. then he said he would dope a horse for me.
40345,Homer,you are my brother. i love you and yet i feel a great sadness in my bosom.
39732,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
38844,Homer,okay! we're there! finally!
13576,Homer,mmm... pancakes.
14721,Homer,"marge, lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, i'm going to be there."
32743,Homer,well wonder no more!
39075,Homer,so... you guys are proud of what you are?
36519,Homer,"i'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""
33143,Homer,"now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--"
35521,Homer,want a ride?
31788,Homer,what are the first three?
20070,Homer,"no, no! your room is full of toys. you're going to the, uh, garage!"
20721,Homer,hmm...
30348,Homer,"okay, marge. but don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
38934,Homer,oh for god's-- now? do you have to?
33983,Homer,marge simpson reporting for duty!
40121,Homer,i've never been more awake in my life.
19804,Homer,"bart, look! it's santa claus!"
22311,Homer,"see ya, kids. me and my val-u-qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! i'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and i'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic."
16126,Homer,"look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. these guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
22827,Homer,i'll handle this.
30258,Homer,i owed the mafia money...
22509,Homer,wouldn't you like to know?
33085,Homer,take me with you!
18732,Homer,"ah! well, if you kids believe in me that much, i'll give it my best shot."
40303,Homer,"omigod! i don't believe it. it's really you, the capital city ""goofball."""
25562,Homer,wowww... it just rolled over to ten thousand.
20183,Homer,"oh, well, it all happened in 1990. back then, the artist formerly known as prince was currently known as prince. tracey ullman was entertaining america with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. and bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."
35152,Homer,"oh okay, uh, lenny, hit me with that chair."
14930,Homer,you know i would never do anything to hurt your feelings. good night.
34380,Homer,"yeah, now that i look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
29390,Homer,"get back in the garage, old man."
23379,Homer,uh-oh.
15846,Homer,this calls for a celebration. we're all going to hawaii!
25836,Homer,trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
22186,Homer,"and i'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here."
40097,Homer,you did?
36643,Homer,this one's cold.

33741,Homer,"up-bup-bup. no jell-o for you, bart -- it'll keep you up at night. like last week when you crawled into bed with me and mommy?"
15867,Homer,"homer's not here, man."

19175,Homer,you really think i could do it?
29336,Homer,"oh. well then, carry on."
37751,Homer,"um... i don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--"
41412,Homer,"okay, hold still. this is the last picture on the roll."
23116,Homer,"well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."
13908,Homer,i want to buy a pony.
22525,Homer,mr. john. i'm your biggest fan. i've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
25027,Homer,huh? but that's impossible.
17411,Homer,"marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. now go upstairs and pack your bags. we're gonna start a new life under the sea."
20700,Homer,"the experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
35372,Homer,"actually, dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
33049,Homer,"is that him? no, it's just a bush. clearly the work of wirakocha, the trickster god."
38485,Homer,milk. that's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. broccoli.
20266,Homer,a c... a coffin!
41213,Homer,what? where're your going? i--

40148,Homer,"aw, come on, marge. you said you'd sleep on it."
21847,Homer,step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of alec-and-ron-and-kim-arabilia.
33487,Homer,bart! don't forget to turn the chicken!
29280,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him. oh, well. bart, i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. but what's going on up here?"
29820,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i got you into this mess. can i snitch on my heart and say... ""i love you""?"
26017,Homer,beautiful.
33372,Homer,woo-hoo!
35058,Homer,life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
28583,Homer,"yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works."
39974,Homer,"son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo."
29214,Homer,cool. you guys got a good buffet up here?
39123,Homer,"man, moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
21897,Homer,"okay, okay. narc."

19915,Homer,"oh, it smells like salmon, too! thanks, boy!"
25329,Homer,did you hear that? she said we're goin' down!
34346,Homer,"you may not realize this, bart, but your mother and i have been fighting about you a lot lately. and i've realized our marriage is more important than your future. from now on, you're on your own."
23020,Homer,i am.
38889,Homer,"so, what do you eat, space broccoli?"
18451,Homer,"""wife: marjorie. children: bartholomew, lisa..."" aha! see, this thing is all screwed up. who the heck is ""margaret"" simpson?"
21223,Homer,never!
26954,Homer,i need you guys to help me. why'd you lock yourselves in?
13194,Homer,is he the same as jack be nimble? and jack frost? and little jack horner?
26228,Homer,woo hoo!
17924,Homer,"you won't be happy 'til my family thinks i'm a loser, will you?"
15555,Homer,wowww.
41279,Homer,i've already gone this far... i wonder what my life would be like if i robbed the kwik-e- mart?
26703,Homer,i'm sick of your lies. secrets and lies. it's always secrets and lies.
26977,Homer,clone?! that's ridiculous. where am i supposed to find a... wait a minute.

26943,Homer,"now that i am the law, i'm gonna make a lot of changes around here. first, i'm gonna cut overhead by freeing otis, the lovable town drunk."
41382,Homer,...lisa simpson.
37069,Homer,"i got it, dad."
35179,Homer,yeah. but lisa won't tell me how to make it.
28301,Homer,you know the drill. try to land on my back-fat.
35120,Homer,"well, i don't know... it's a lot of work."
36737,Homer,"just listen. if you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are."
25624,Homer,i have nothing he wants.
21350,Homer,"air's getting thin, but i'm gonna make it. woo! getting lightheaded... good -- no heavy head to carry. wait! i'll just take that escalator!"
25565,Homer,glibbie glop gloopie / nibbie nabbie noobie / la le lo lo lo.
38699,Homer,"look, i really need a campsite. my wife is making sandwiches!"
31849,Homer,ronaldo?! winner of two world cups and three fifa player of the year awards?
20623,Homer,you're...
24036,Homer,"now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies."
18302,Homer,take out the garbage.
29876,Homer,"wait, did i add that right?"
30105,Homer,"wake up! the rapture is coming in half an hour! there's no time to waste! marge, grill a chicken! no, make sandwiches! and some kettle chips would be nice! original, not barbecue!"
17556,Homer,"why, you clattering clank of.... my dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. d'oh the pain! d'oh the pain of it all!"
38069,Homer,"look, the eagles and the falcons. tell me you're not interested in that."
25343,Homer,who are you?
23470,Homer,move the handbrake...
27733,Homer,"well, he does. all my life i've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. mr. burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" no, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
17895,Homer,"well, maybe i'll just stay and work overtime. my sisters-in-law are at my house again."
28926,Homer,don't worry. your secret's safe with me.
25231,Homer,no problem.
14519,Homer,"well, he just goes... ohhh"
38866,Homer,that's right. pick the only two times in history where things got messy.
40975,Homer,from the shelbyville orphanage?
32234,Homer,"before you go, could you hire your own replacement? but make sure she's not crazy like you."
38160,Homer,"marge, you like kindness, right?"
35126,Homer,and you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
27482,Homer,yes...
17088,Homer,"i love you... will you marry me, marge?... you mean i'm gonna be a daddy?... i hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
37686,Homer,what the?! if this kid's dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
35830,Homer,and people will see my tattoo of donald duck smoking a doob! that was for marge's eyes only! oh my god!
14062,Homer,i decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
21315,Homer,"hello, handsome. nice muscles. care for a rubdown? oh-ho, well, i'm flattered, but spoken for. oh, what the heck, give me your number."
24482,Homer,take your time!
39695,Homer,"but you don't understand, marge. i have fifty bucks riding on this game."
34603,Homer,"well, uh... the one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so i'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?"
18750,Homer,"town crier. i'd like to ask you a few questions. one: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
27460,Homer,ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! i'm married to joey heatherton.
26122,Homer,"bye, moe."

36354,Homer,why don't you talk to mrs. steak?
33242,Homer,"here's the plan, marge. you keep 'em talking. i'll be listening... and quietly judging."
16494,Homer,mmmm... marge.
21692,Homer,"aww... ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur."
20072,Homer,"well, i'm sorry if you heard ""disneyland"", but i distinctly said ""military school."""
24813,Homer,"aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should i do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? i better throw it in the garbage."
27954,Homer,"look, i have no idea who frank lloyd wright is."
15967,Homer,"it'll be a long time before your mother gets back with the tire, so why don't i tell you more of the story? now that we had a name, the be sharps needed a hit. something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's..."
40106,Homer,"dirty trick. okay, i'm not gonna kill you, but i'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. you ruined your father. you've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
21987,Homer,yeah... pinchy?... pinchy?!... oh... pinchy!!!
24048,Homer,"oh, i missed one!"
36092,Homer,it's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.

20733,Homer,"oh, we'll see about that. gimme ten rings."
19816,Homer,"or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
36322,Homer,british version was better.
33263,Homer,gotta prove the genie was right...
35176,Homer,your kisses feel like raw liver.
30311,Homer,"look, if it were up to me, i'd be harassing them with you. if anything, i'd be the guy who took it too far. but i love my wife and i want to win her back!"
17620,Homer,the black panthers?
25945,Homer,"hey, how ya doin'?"
30532,Homer,i don't know.
21281,Homer,nay!
22831,Homer,"oh, i got that, lady."
25948,Homer,"just the radio, dear."
29651,Homer,"don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. i have a more humane solution."
33351,Homer,"yup -- back in high school, right before i met your mother. a simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation..."
31090,Homer,but do you also remember that you're an enabler?
14989,Homer,no. they moved to phoenix.
20235,Homer,...and that inscription is still there today.
28670,Homer,here in my car / i am hosing off blood / some of it's mine / but most of it's not / here's marge...

16904,Homer,"sorry, bart. i'm gonna have to sell him."
38915,Homer,"and marge, i've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. a little sour and a little sick."
18367,Homer,"hey, flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
33531,Homer,you just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
18599,Homer,"look, guys. it's not that simple, he's my boss. i'll tell you what: i'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
34804,Homer,"man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
28240,Homer,"look mom, look! i'm riding by myself!"
38414,Homer,do you want to be more alone?

32916,Homer,"this is hard work. isn't it, boy? boy?"
36009,Homer,well i'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
34458,Homer,please tell me they suffered.
33483,Homer,it's so beautiful. no two are exactly alike. though many of them are very similar.
19743,Homer,who doesn't?
13303,Homer,"did you hear that, marge? she called me a baboon! the stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
36335,Homer,and where will i walk?

33831,Homer,that's not enough.
14884,Homer,"marge, am i crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
35037,Homer,"it's kind of weird, us all being naked in here."

28280,Homer,you think i won't manhandle a little boy?!
13489,Homer,"all right, think very carefully. where did you see it last?"
27099,Homer,really? you really think i'm better than you?
40087,Homer,"well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and i always run out."
26650,Homer,look at shemp! he is so high!

32447,Homer,"marge, get away from them!"
40753,Homer,"well, yeah, maybe, but i just met this girl, marge bouvier and i want to force her to like me."

37299,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
36582,Homer,"ooh, i like that. now, i'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
35491,Homer,"there's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
30202,Homer,"i didn't need that new fact! now i forgot who won bud bowl eight. boy, i'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
40861,Homer,how can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?
23141,Homer,guilty as charged.
35740,Homer,"i just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is."
32035,Homer,why you little...

27775,Homer,bart's growing up without me. he won't be ten forever.
19318,Homer,i don't wanna go to that.
14701,Homer,"well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. but she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
13396,Homer,no.
32611,Homer,happier!
29168,Homer,"here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"
21085,Homer,no.

40026,Homer,i wish i had amoria phlebitis.
37008,Homer,why do we have to shoot them at all?
23111,Homer,"hi, girls."
19048,Homer,"um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of old harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. no, make it two."
18464,Homer,"hey, everybody, i've got a big surprise for you! presenting: my mother!"
27726,Homer,"megatronics tip twenty: ""make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""
17180,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
18345,Homer,"stupidity, eh?"
14531,Homer,three simple words. i am gay.
21643,Homer,"so, we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it! then i'll be an inventor!"
26721,Homer,leave me alone!
19852,Homer,"maybe i do, chief. maybe i do..."
16369,Homer,mmmmm... free goo.
22130,Homer,"it's my duty, marge. besides, those mobsters don't scare me. bart, would you go start daddy's car?"
27814,Homer,can't help you -- all i got is gray. anybody working on a cement wall?
40464,Homer,"not now, lisa."
28375,Homer,"hmm, dare i pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
20544,Homer,i didn't like it. the mast had termites.
15661,Homer,"first, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. that's when it's time to kick some back."
35134,Homer,mix it in.
20378,Homer,"ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
36735,Homer,you really should tweet less.
19502,Homer,the light! we gotta get the light back on!
34109,Homer,"oh, sweet meerschaum, take me away."
21416,Homer,"well, daddy will figure it out."
22576,Homer,"ohhh, when will detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?"
38874,Homer,"see, marge?"
23042,Homer,there's only three left in the world!
37229,Homer,"you grandson-ruining fiend! look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
40235,Homer,"hey, you did it!"

20778,Homer,how much is this free resort weekend?
20131,Homer,"aaaaaahhhhhhhhh. oh, yes. oh."
39327,Homer,this lunkhead?

27725,Homer,"i finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. well, time for work."
24299,Homer,is there any other st. louis?
19264,Homer,just a minute!
19081,Homer,stop! those candidates are phonies!
14833,Homer,don't jinx it!
14890,Homer,he-he-he.
26912,Homer,"look at him over there, eating that apple. what's he planning? what?!"
14561,Homer,"marge, forget it. he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do."
20481,Homer,not... really...
33521,Homer,"oh, flanders, i promise i'll never abuse our friendship again."
33197,Homer,surely some holds are barred.
33601,Homer,ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. it's as if danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.
13390,Homer,it's true. it's all true.
28173,Homer,leave everything to me.
33366,Homer,i've gotta know.
17688,Homer,marge...
25537,Homer,"no, i can handle it. i'll get you, squealer."
30231,Homer,why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? shouldn't bart and i be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
16082,Homer,"yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. besides, it isn't costing us - i swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
38313,Homer,where'd you get that dress?
30908,Homer,i thought it was about her boobs.
14450,Homer,"marge, marge, how do i use the pressure cooker?"
16250,Homer,"mmmmm, candy."

27648,Homer,"poor ned, gardening away his misery."
35371,Homer,"i get to enjoy this, but i'm not responsible."

20205,Homer,i'll give ya fifty bucks.
21125,Homer,"but mr. burns gave me my job. and he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one china syndrome. i can't betray him."
41164,Homer,"woo-ooo! i'm a work of art! ""last supper"", eat your heart out!"
26349,Homer,"hey marge, i just thought of something."
34712,Homer,another good one...
40074,Homer,i deserve this.
16193,Homer,"well, we didn't get any money, but mr. burns got what he wanted. marge, i'm confused. is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
30747,Homer,"so lenny, how's it goin' in vegas? pretty boring, i'll bet."
31230,Homer,"cool, a carpenter's library!"
13598,Homer,"""well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- ain't it the truth."

33854,Homer,"how 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?"
20081,Homer,"oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
15397,Homer,"and that ""little while"" is now eight years and counting. heh heh heh."
36122,Homer,stupid kid.
26806,Homer,i take a whiskey drink / i take a chocolate drink / and when i have to pee / i use the kitchen sink / i sing the song that reminds me i'm a urinating guy!
21021,Homer,no.

38381,Homer,now where's she going?
23306,Homer,"hm. this pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."

31001,Homer,what? i have great ass suction. now how 'bout a little privacy?
26688,Homer,waiting for my wife. she has a surprise for me.

16438,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
35384,Homer,"a hundred dollars?! marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
13839,Homer,"well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
31778,Homer,"okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
27674,Homer,let him speak!
38131,Homer,"boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done."
20121,Homer,geez! that's just... awful!
34341,Homer,must apologize. must apologize.

14177,Homer,woo-hoo! i got my job back!
15858,Homer,i can't believe i ate the whole thing.
30452,Homer,"they'll bounce back, son. they're a strong people."
14743,Homer,my whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
33248,Homer,"shut up, old man."
21953,Homer,"hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? oh, i can't afford that."
18972,Homer,"back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
35086,Homer,"check this out, bart. one of those retinal scan dealies. it only opens to my eye or an exact copy."
33495,Homer,why you little...
33520,Homer,that's not true. you have bug bites you can scratch.
16837,Homer,food fight!
22774,Homer,"i gave a rib to eve, and now she's gone forever."
29356,Homer,"you know what, mr. burns? i'm never comin' back. my son's making so much cash in the t-shirt game, that i don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as i age."
40037,Homer,"dear god, give a bald guy a break. amen."
17730,Homer,"this was the happiest time of my life. i'll never forget you guys. especially you, joey."
17691,Homer,everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. i hope things stay exactly like this forever.
34084,Homer,"marge, please. you're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
25212,Homer,"ah, you saw our bus ad."
33181,Homer,"exactly. you're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?"
24370,Homer,can't sleep. gonna die. can't sleep. gonna die.
38159,Homer,then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
30602,Homer,you're sending me to italy?
32422,Homer,"/ when happy they sparkle, when sad they cries"
24872,Homer,no way! mr. x is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
19613,Homer,"mr. burns, i insist that we cheat!"
34294,Homer,"yeah, the simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few..."
36172,Homer,"so, i gotta know... do you guys forgive me?"
30811,Homer,i deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
37542,Homer,"boy, oh boy!"
14787,Homer,"son, come here. heh, heh, heh. of course i'm not mad. if something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. you just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch tv."
29210,Homer,but ice cream cake...
36607,Homer,sorry guys. private family moment.
21150,Homer,i call president!
39829,Homer,"well... uh... wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir."
21409,Homer,"feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? that's what my heart's doing all the time. bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
19362,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
33226,Homer,"well, i had a little help from this guy."
29112,Homer,that's not true! i thought about that girl every day of my life... until i met you.
13552,Homer,"oh, of course i've heard of you. i mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
29616,Homer,do you cletus take brandine to be...
16533,Homer,"oh yeah, the costume."
15806,Homer,arrrgh!
21138,Homer,"hey, that guy looks like you."
22016,Homer,so... you're saying i don't need a new muffler?
26995,Homer,noooo!
36723,Homer,someone must be watching on another tv.
28991,Homer,noooo!
14166,Homer,i think i did pretty good in there.
40594,Homer,what are you talking about? nobody's trying to teach you that.
40261,Homer,"will you shut up, i'm trying to think of a name."
36488,Homer,"hey, why don't we go see lady gaga? that'll turn your frown upside down."
33792,Homer,"hello, little girl, who do you belong to?"
14523,Homer,maggie. oh. cute.
23847,Homer,"remember my love affair with ali mcgraw? she used to call me ""preppy."" then she died."
15924,Homer,"now, come on! i'm your best customer."
18711,Homer,bull-honkey! i don't care about joining this stupid club.
15093,Homer,and that is that.
39730,Homer,"well, maybe i am a little responsible."
26270,Homer,"ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!"
38837,Homer,"oh marge, you found me! you always find me. now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot."
17622,Homer,what? did i miss something?
26600,Homer,this corn doesn't look so big.
22216,Homer,"well, there you go. now how 'bout a drink?"
21065,Homer,enough of what's out! what's in?
16781,Homer,why am i such a loser? why?
16077,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
32660,Homer,...hating being famous.
32568,Homer,who was it with?
35731,Homer,"come on beautiful, i can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
26890,Homer,i've made my choice.
16962,Homer,because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
26605,Homer,"so lisa says by killing their enemy, i became the alpha-crow."
16328,Homer,rust i tell ya.
24719,Homer,"this is perfect! if i know fat tony, which i don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. come on."
14414,Homer,"don't worry, moe. i'm not bettin'."

22856,Homer,"this piece i call ""failed shelving unit with stupid stuck chainsaw and applesauce."""
37462,Homer,"hey, what's this? ""i've gone home. goodbye forever, carl carlson."""
25857,Homer,i love our court days.
17668,Homer,"simpson ten, terrorists eight."

34669,Homer,and i'm not a locksmith!
28828,Homer,"oh bart, what a man you've become."
19757,Homer,"right. thank you. i hope you realize this is all your fault. i mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?"
15470,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best jew... but i rented ""fiddler on the roof"", and i will watch it. anyway, can i have forty-thousand dollars?"
37906,Homer,why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the air buds and ray liottas of the world?
39946,Homer,"no, i'm not. i'm hopping on the bandwagon. now come on, son, get with the winning team."
38190,Homer,that's why she'll believe it.
29796,Homer,"oh my god! that man might be hurt! guards, there's a prisoner in there!"
26498,Homer,"overdue book?! this is the biggest frame-up since o.j. wait a minute... blood in the bronco... the cuts on his hand... those jay leno monologues... oh my god, he did it!"
15151,Homer,"no tricks, boy. i said i'm gonna punish you and come hell or high water i... wait a minute..."

27519,Homer,"woo-hoo! can i get that in lottery tickets, please?"
21403,Homer,"oh, lisa, thank god you're okay!"

13468,Homer,"lisa, dim the lights! no, turn on more lights! but do something!"
28176,Homer,i'unno.
16949,Homer,how come bart gets to do that and i can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside chef boyardee's house?
39985,Homer,because i'm so carefree?
37234,Homer,"he's taking on mean man monty! go get him, honest abe!"
25056,Homer,"ahh, why does that always happen?"
20480,Homer,"oh. well, congratulations."
37904,Homer,"well, what'd you think?"
33797,Homer,"that's not henry the seventh, it's henry the sixth! stupid, stupid, stupid!"
22830,Homer,you mean this hunka junk? this isn't art. just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. didn't you? didn't you?! you stupid so...

24354,Homer,are you a good driver?
21849,Homer,"that's right, mister tough guy can't handle a little penicillin. oh, and look at this. we can't even pay our bills and they're drinking royal crown cola."
13760,Homer,"simpson, it's all up to you. it's showtime!"
22519,Homer,"not yet, i'm not. you'll know when i'm driving. and it'll..."

25413,Homer,"either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
22386,Homer,wow. they've captured my personality perfectly. did you see the way daddy caught that bullet?
32101,Homer,i'm so happy!

28189,Homer,i can't go on...
23177,Homer,they are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
39168,Homer,see what i mean? always an argument.
33180,Homer,"look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. you have all your hair... unlike me. no kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... oh, god, i hate my life!"
31716,Homer,"yes i do. under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets."
16650,Homer,that dog can sell anything.

29301,Homer,"oh, what's the big deal? bart didn't like his presents. so what? it's not like he gives us such great gifts. remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? what was that? that was crap."
40535,Homer,really? great!
38997,Homer,"go ahead, boy."
26208,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. liquors drunkened me."

28857,Homer,"you got it. and when i feel weak, i will draw strength from the bible."
39840,Homer,"you see, i'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
22747,Homer,"ten-four, dead buddy."

29123,Homer,"oh, sorry, right."
37534,Homer,"don't worry, moe. when marge is asleep, i'll sneak back."
29375,Homer,"honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. remember, i did used to work at a science factory."

34427,Homer,"i am more than alive, woman! i am the chosen one who shall unite all the faiths of the holy land! i am... the messiah!"
27439,Homer,it's all my fault my wife got mugged.

22120,Homer,"and to think, i respected you! and defended you! you wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
30844,Homer,"and now i'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later i can say that i already told you."

28848,Homer,"oh honey, i love to hear you laugh."
37527,Homer,"hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
26594,Homer,"hey, bart. how many more places do we have to search?"
31640,Homer,"parents who are still alive, i might add."
18579,Homer,"mr. burns, i, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
15587,Homer,no. what are the odds of getting sick on a saturday? a thousand to one.

21238,Homer,"i hate the public so much. if only they'd elect me... i'd make 'em pay. oh moe, how do i make 'em like me?"
33857,Homer,why can't i have it now? you got your present here. basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
20905,Homer,"let's get out of here, moe. this is goin' nowhere."
41247,Homer,"no, the other secret."

26340,Homer,"aw, looks like a little angel. now to save me marge."
38443,Homer,"now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."
35030,Homer,anyone see a good beer commercial lately?
14731,Homer,"oh, that's hot. there isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. well, g'bye."
14865,Homer,i gave herb all the money i had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
34619,Homer,"son, i'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and i can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
19531,Homer,"well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were discussing wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
38299,Homer,"hey, i can't screw this up or lisa will get stuck with someone like me."
23179,Homer,"well, i think we lost 'em."
26109,Homer,"look at me, i'm a famous historian! out of my way!"
16563,Homer,"you know lisa, music helps daddy think."
37461,Homer,i don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
17350,Homer,"quiet down, bart!"
13675,Homer,"hey flanders, how's business?"
29676,Homer,i just felt a chill go through my very soul.
15302,Homer,i'm gonna lose my plow.
23088,Homer,ignor-- what?
26944,Homer,what a character.
39771,Homer,'night.
33492,Homer,yes.
27421,Homer,"oh, lisa has excellent hearing. once when she was three, i was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
30380,Homer,"now featuring the pox box! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. like any disease box, results may vary. pox box!"
14813,Homer,"marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
32636,Homer,that was the best milkshake ad i've ever seen. it makes me want a milkshake!
23318,Homer,"nobody talks to me that way! i'm homer simpson! the most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! you hear me? no comeuppance! we'll be right back."

28643,Homer,i had a car!
17437,Homer,"marge, my friend, i haven't learned a thing."
23208,Homer,sure you do. all your favorite stars have used drugs: brett butler.... tim allen...
30958,Homer,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
36482,Homer,are you gonna do that every time i open one of these?
33039,Homer,this counts as a parent-teacher conference!
17317,Homer,probably misses his old glasses.
32118,Homer,will you shut up? i can't hear the song in my head!
15112,Homer,he was a zombie?
16910,Homer,thank you.
31605,Homer,i swear revenge on meaux! even if it takes me the rest of my life! can you loosen my arm so i can shake my fist?
22568,Homer,i don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
15300,Homer,"not as low as my low, low prices."
22479,Homer,"just try it for two weeks. if you're not completely satisfied, you can be busty st. claire."
28980,Homer,we get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? as the bible says: screw that!
17481,Homer,dad!
14098,Homer,"oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic."
28571,Homer,they live in fancy houses in other places.
33829,Homer,ha! i can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. how i despise them.
36295,Homer,then take us out to sea.
23874,Homer,"i believe i had hair. oh, here they are."
34198,Homer,"tickets, please. hey, where's your ticket? leave me alone! why you little..."
25630,Homer,"symmetry, eh?"

37795,Homer,"why you little... i'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! c'mere, you!"
31971,Homer,"oh man, i love oktoberfest. oktoberfest!"
16502,Homer,"i got a job at burns' casino. as you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer."
15819,Homer,no! no! beer bring pain!
39489,Homer,ready as she'll ever be!
14238,Homer,"dear marge, xxx. homer."
39878,Homer,be good.
23016,Homer,but i was gonna score...
17573,Homer,"so anyway, lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays. and they don't tell me where they go. it's like a conspiracy."
17987,Homer,"whew! uh, enjoy."
28459,Homer,my pleasure.
35613,Homer,"thy will be done, lord vader. please don't hurt me. please."
40808,Homer,she's with him.
28203,Homer,"okay, get ready to laugh!"
22250,Homer,what if we switched wives? would that help?
22480,Homer,fine. hooty mcboob it is.
31079,Homer,marge?
37064,Homer,stop being blasé!
31106,Homer,"aw dude, i was totally here. you calling me a liar? in front of my kids? 'cause i'd take a bullet for you, man. right in my mouth!"
28430,Homer,"they're looking for a male bear, right?"
39359,Homer,"don't be discouraged, son. i bet einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb."
33069,Homer,"so at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."
26460,Homer,and don't you forget it.
40775,Homer,"look, i'm not asking you to like me, i'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where i can touch your goodies, i'm just asking you to be fair."
33320,Homer,"don't worry, lisa. where else are they gonna go?"
41470,Homer,you're the idiot.
13813,Homer,"c'mom pal, i don't wanna hear your life story. paw me!"
26699,Homer,kathleen turner!
18645,Homer,i guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. heh heh heh.
23560,Homer,real real real real real!
32071,Homer,woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals!
23596,Homer,"marge, has my life peaked?"
18211,Homer,noooooooo!
14650,Homer,i know. i want to pet him again!
31173,Homer,uh... she was here a minute ago. she must be pooping.
36564,Homer,i turned it off.
39507,Homer,do i smell cupcakes?
27012,Homer,isn't vacation sex always the best?
31256,Homer,"yeah, i hear it too. maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""we will, we will rock you..."""
24385,Homer,"now, this is living!"
31793,Homer,kids. they always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
37047,Homer,oh my god. oh my god. this counts as a walk!
36452,Homer,"i'll take you with me, old man!"
25995,Homer,sorry. he seems nice.
13634,Homer,lousy cheap country...
32814,Homer,"and remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and tv movies. regular movies, don't hold your breath. but tv movies, the sky's the limit."
35882,Homer,don't tread on pee! we probably have rights!
38735,Homer,sure it is. you know i've always loved laying things down. grooves are just the latest.
27867,Homer,i see.
24667,Homer,"whatever. the point is, i'm homer simpson."
26695,Homer,then came the day that changes every couple forever. the day we got our elephant.
31018,Homer,let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
38857,Homer,uh-oh.
22106,Homer,semi-imported. keep 'em comin'.
20256,Homer,little marge...
36174,Homer,free it is!
19476,Homer,"wherever my soul mate is, it's not here."
33391,Homer,why? why?
30401,Homer,"well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but i have one more question: did you sleep with kirk van houten?"
24447,Homer,worse.
26012,Homer,"i'll throw myself out, thank you."
17517,Homer,but i -
25959,Homer,where's the defibrillator?
32799,Homer,"how could a man just abandon his family? by which i mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?"
20596,Homer,"oh, yeah. i'm a real expert."
26074,Homer,let go of her or i'll scream!
13444,Homer,"what's the problem, boy?"
30944,Homer,"uh-huh... do i have to? okay, okay, i'll show the cow i adore it."
24864,Homer,that lousy pothole! why don't they fix it?
24909,Homer,but i don't know anything. at least i don't think i do.
20969,Homer,"if i were her, i'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake."
20086,Homer,you got the black one.
24041,Homer,"okay, nobody panic. there's plenty of spray for me."
23037,Homer,they're years ahead of us.
39863,Homer,"actually, i was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?"
37676,Homer,that is a good fire.
38742,Homer,"oh... yeah, apu, i'm sure you're a great singer. but the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. no disrespect to world music. i love world music."
32735,Homer,"but kids, i want you in bed by three a.m."
21019,Homer,see ya in a week.
16605,Homer,it's his job.
26622,Homer,i had a bad experience with drugs...

19222,Homer,"hey, you're that hitchhiker! what are you doing here?"
41162,Homer,"mmm, only thirty-five calories."
17954,Homer,okay! wait a minute. why did it take you so long to say yes?
35323,Homer,"hello, boat store? i'd like to order a boat. what do you mean, dial tone?"
20671,Homer,"oh great, now we have to send him a card."
14619,Homer,"oh, come on! i'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. marge, make him stop."
17074,Homer,why you little...

14569,Homer,like what?
20042,Homer,"oh. design your own power plant, eh? this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am."
40334,Homer,one for the road.
34515,Homer,"hey, chief. i uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket."
34066,Homer,"now, it's my turn to roll the dice! wanna kiss them for me?"

23590,Homer,"woo hoo! first stop, maude flanders."
30319,Homer,"hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed r and r?"
36936,Homer,"why would you think that, just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
24745,Homer,you call that saying grace?!
36556,Homer,"okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""magic craphole waste removal,"" but it wasn't me."
27221,Homer,"i know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, lenny."
16136,Homer,not funny. and the one in my pants really hurt.

23917,Homer,look how loud i have to yell!
26939,Homer,"you know, the old lady's apartment was actually lenny's. we just used a different duvet cover."

15894,Homer,"marge, it's too late. the boy's ten years old! let's focus our energy on lisa and the other one."
18282,Homer,"i understand, honey. i used to believe in things when i was a kid."
17451,Homer,"oh, here we are. the ""utility room."""

41335,Homer,what train?
14149,Homer,"marge, it's not the money. my job is my identity. if i'm not a safety whatchamajigger, i'm nothing."
28631,Homer,he knows just how i like my martinis... full of alcohol.
34171,Homer,"watch your language! now, why the hell not?"

19873,Homer,"hey, boy, get crackin'! moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
34585,Homer,"absolutely. he's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. they'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. but if i'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way."
24431,Homer,uhh... no.
14168,Homer,no problems here.
24684,Homer,"yeah, we're heroes... but where's our parade?"
33390,Homer,"i would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. why did fate do this to me?"
24802,Homer,did you see daddy dance? they all saw me dance.
38677,Homer,what the?
18547,Homer,"'tis the season, marge! we only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
37181,Homer,waldo. waldo.
17241,Homer,"what're you, the narrator?"
35330,Homer,"okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. so why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down."
22411,Homer,and that big yellow flower.
34323,Homer,"too late, marge. i already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
22551,Homer,"but that's not for awhile, right?"
14639,Homer,yes.
24617,Homer,i accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose!
39898,Homer,"come along, adil."
18041,Homer,i know. and this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. it just keeps going faster and faster.
30564,Homer,"whups, be careful of my tail."
17554,Homer,"tell me the truth! don't tell her i raised my voice. don't. happy family, happy family."
22236,Homer,"but ginger, honey, i am not the catch i appear to be."
33027,Homer,"i loved you, man!"
20914,Homer,i'll do it!
36395,Homer,"now, listen, lisa--"
34602,Homer,"a phony bird call?! that means marge is coming! everyone, act legal!"
38732,Homer,"this is embarrassing to admit, stig, but i hadn't even thought about gels."
27138,Homer,rock and roll! woo hoo!
35325,Homer,i want my pot of gold!
24233,Homer,hmm. this isn't nearly as complicated as moe made it seem.
23731,Homer,... and those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look i get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
32977,Homer,"i sure could've, thanks to you."
35464,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. daddy will put jack back in the box."
16058,Homer,i suck.
16553,Homer,"shhh, quiet lisa."
25933,Homer,"okay, she lives at one ocean view drive. let's start skulking."
23759,Homer,"uhh. is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? is that what this is, lisa?"
32170,Homer,"oh man, that church service was so boring. i did a whole book of find-a-words."
38569,Homer,which one's yours?
16350,Homer,"hold on, son."
38316,Homer,"thanks, frenchy."
13236,Homer,"so whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye..."
24203,Homer,"do you hear me, lord?! homer's doing your work! i'm the greatest missionary of all time! of all time!"
17106,Homer,wait until my class hears about this. kidding!
38800,Homer,"hey, pal. can't believe you have to work christmas eve."
17660,Homer,that's exciting.
17045,Homer,"all right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
35690,Homer,fun dad is a foodie now!
33365,Homer,ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
39699,Homer,ah!
33848,Homer,"two, actually. twins."
41125,Homer,holy moly! you're winning!
35282,Homer,who do you have next period?
22804,Homer,"how 'bout it, bart? would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
19904,Homer,"wooo, we're in orbit now! what's that? a call from the president? hello?... uh, yes. ""let me just say this about that."" okay, mr. president..."
25878,Homer,"okay, son. concentrate... shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."
24047,Homer,"be patient, son. a rushed car never crashes."
36811,Homer,"this boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! i am his father... i can't believe i allowed you to hit on me."
41157,Homer,"well, wait a minute. hey, i've been setting my drinks on these things."
38081,Homer,it doesn't matter. i'm taking it pass-fail.
16472,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
27384,Homer,i thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
26404,Homer,go gamecocks!
21398,Homer,lisa? lisa? lisa!
35693,Homer,"you know, i'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. maybe i'll like it."
36263,Homer,what happened to you guys? you used to be cool.
31806,Homer,can't i even have privacy here?!
33221,Homer,"lisa, sweetie... please, look at your daddy."
17565,Homer,"hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
32917,Homer,why you little...
15525,Homer,it's my life-long dream.
31893,Homer,i'll write you a check.
35000,Homer,"so that's it! you used me to kill a man, and all i get is a handshake and a blanket?"
32294,Homer,"okay, i made a mistake. why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?"
33930,Homer,he's gone.
16575,Homer,"woo hoo, hoo! take that maynard g. krebs!"
31508,Homer,look out! it's the grumple!
33352,Homer,guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
24664,Homer,i'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to the who.
30179,Homer,"hey, you knocked out my power. how am i supposed to eat without watching tv?"
40442,Homer,"oh it's great to have you back, boy! we were afraid we'd lost you!"
27475,Homer,and i miss being your knight in flabby armor.
23160,Homer,i second that motion...
41234,Homer,don't say revenge. don't say revenge.
22089,Homer,follow me.
29344,Homer,"okay. i'll run as fast as i can, but i'm full of potato salad."
14734,Homer,uh... i gotta think about this.
35652,Homer,little help?
18758,Homer,dig up his grave! pull out his tongue!
26847,Homer,please don't kill me! i won't tell anyone about the skeleton. and i could bring you more victims. like lenny! he'd go great with wild rice.
29081,Homer,permission to treat this witness as hostile.
16315,Homer,absolutely! and this is just the beginning! i've got some big plans.
33032,Homer,"well, i'm--"
35628,Homer,what the-- this is a gentleman's club!
18778,Homer,lousy two-legged pants.
41007,Homer,"hi'ya, team."
39729,Homer,"lay off the boy, marge. he's a good kid. quit givin' him the third degree."
14209,Homer,oh.
20199,Homer,wait a minute... she's right!
32538,Homer,"a ""forget-me-shot?"" never heard of it."
28053,Homer,and when i hear...
32376,Homer,who is it?
38517,Homer,"aye-aye, sir."
26790,Homer,"uh, we didn't order that."
30304,Homer,you stole my wife! i'll kill you!
19356,Homer,"telemarketing, eh?"
35481,Homer,"guys, quit telling the truth!"
35894,Homer,"because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, i can't go out in public."
20619,Homer,that old flanders place gives me the creeps.
32442,Homer,"um, so... tell me about your day."
18409,Homer,could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
27395,Homer,i can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
34240,Homer,i agreed to no such thing!
25816,Homer,"hey, that's me. and that's you."
41134,Homer,"heads up, kids. i'm moving the seat back."
16795,Homer,"well, i guess i should pay my share..."
38689,Homer,you're right. no one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. certainly not me. pass the gravy?
28892,Homer,"okay, marge. for you i'll give up rum-based cocktails. except mojitos and rum and coke."
33141,Homer,"listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. but you're goin' in the box."
39371,Homer,"but, sir, i --"
18906,Homer,i'm sick of these constant bear attacks! it's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
13670,Homer,"wouldn't it, flanders?"
24781,Homer,at lenny? but he's a war hero!
39506,Homer,that piece of junk? forget it! we're going to get a new tv! twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
32227,Homer,"so did you see the show tonight? remember the part where i forgot the words and i just sang ""uh-oh spaghetti-os"". i'm hoping they send me a case."
16064,Homer,"yes! take that, bitterman!"
22231,Homer,"ahh, precious memories."
30468,Homer,"i'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn."
29140,Homer,buy me some peanuts and crackerjack... / i don't care if... ow!
23774,Homer,come on!
33643,Homer,what the?
15083,Homer,that's bad.
29089,Homer,why? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life? that's still one more than you.
27507,Homer,can and will. now to un-stop this sink.
36203,Homer,just like my hair.
23748,Homer,"whaddaya say, honey?"
40796,Homer,"marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
34200,Homer,"one, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five."
17817,Homer,putting speed holes in my car. makes it go faster.
23199,Homer,"yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
39401,Homer,i'm talking about that!
16295,Homer,that's them!
20886,Homer,"you too, bart."
28959,Homer,"marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and i became one."
34438,Homer,spread the word! peace and chicken!
24735,Homer,"ah, the luftwaffe. the washington generals of the history channel."
14508,Homer,"well what a surprise. marge sticks up for flanders! can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, ned flanders?"
33648,Homer,"thank you, that's very... more sarcasm."
39273,Homer,yeah.
28954,Homer,"okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my lois lane comics, buy some jimmy olsens, and stop edna from making a terrible mistake!"
15727,Homer,you got it. no deer for a month.
25370,Homer,"wait a minute, bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? that's pretty farfetched, lisa."
28960,Homer,would you marry me again?
28022,Homer,i didn't want them to know my size.
35825,Homer,i'm okay! and i found some gold!
31228,Homer,this doesn't taste like i thought it would.
41313,Homer,dammit!
22471,Homer,eep! leave me alone! go swab begley. he likes it!
19756,Homer,"there's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. and bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
18704,Homer,"mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
37634,Homer,one random disorder free with every schizophrenia.
35989,Homer,sweet!
25087,Homer,you're right. that suit gizmo could be worth billions. and i'm gonna get a piece of the action!
17065,Homer,"this is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
35791,Homer,"it's a rat race, but it looks like i won."
16055,Homer,"is ""tv guide"" a book?"
18213,Homer,"i said shut your ugly face, flanders."
29527,Homer,"after you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!"
37434,Homer,"marge, i have something to show you."
38565,Homer,hm. that is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
34855,Homer,all right. we'll get the vaccine.
21977,Homer,we're not eating mr. pinchy. he's part of the family now.
20529,Homer,"ahh. is this the life, or what?"
21712,Homer,"come here, you little--"
17396,Homer,"that's right, we all thought it was hilarious. but it turns out we were wrong. that alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
29921,Homer,"well, that's a world of difference. light me up, doc!"
25064,Homer,... i feel like makin' love / makin' love to you! / do do dooo / do do dooo.
33888,Homer,mac-who?
15160,Homer,can't he be both like the late earl warren?
25661,Homer,christ be with you.
22743,Homer,"red. the trucker. big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?"
20543,Homer,"lousy cops. lucky for you i'm double-parked or i'd... there. now, can i please have my motorboat?"
24019,Homer,why are you talking like that?
37231,Homer,how are you a winner? you're cheating in a fake sport!
25441,Homer,that's it! i'll go on a hunger strike.
37488,Homer,carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
20022,Homer,"no, no. he doesn't know he's coming to dinner. i didn't think he'd come, so i called and said i had something really important to tell him and that i could only tell him about it here."
38330,Homer,yo. where's my body?
36850,Homer,"thanks, baby. here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
31471,Homer,you used to love it!
19508,Homer,"nah, it's friday night moe. i wanna try something special."
29489,Homer,what's a cuckold?
40001,Homer,good lord! what have those little hellions done now?
33721,Homer,"burn, barty, burn!"
38253,Homer,everything's right with the world.
19548,Homer,"now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
39259,Homer,uh-oh.

30676,Homer,his hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!

18117,Homer,"oh, marge. you saved my life! i'm sorry i teased you. you're a really good cop. i'm proud of you."
16173,Homer,hmmm. sixty-four slices of american cheese.
34816,Homer,woo-hoo!
38476,Homer,me neither.
40335,Homer,"sorry, marge. but it's just that i'm still steamed up about that jerk flanders. lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off..."
14499,Homer,"damn, crappy nails! super glue my butt!"
16539,Homer,"you promised lisa to help her with her costume. you made her cry, then i cried. then maggie laughed. she's such a little trooper."
22152,Homer,"ohh, i'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent."
36517,Homer,"lousy outdated relics! boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to new york?"
34773,Homer,"o-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
32771,Homer,fatherhood hurts my brain.
23681,Homer,"she's no liza, but it works."
33700,Homer,"well, i'm glad they suspended milhouse. he's a bad influence on you."
27965,Homer,flames? searing pain? a black cat? i must be in heaven.
21371,Homer,aha. there's some glue.
28113,Homer,people will do anything a sign tells them.
18821,Homer,will do.
29254,Homer,"steady, steady..."
21396,Homer,i hope this works...
16913,Homer,done.
27189,Homer,"you took a twenty-karat diamond, and made it gleam / like a big spaghetti dinner, smothered in whipped cream."
16431,Homer,"uh, so. let's have a conversation. uh, i think we'll find we have very little in common."
37570,Homer,to texting!
23675,Homer,my corneas! you were saying?
33824,Homer,four walls? i was thinking more of something in a two or three.
34999,Homer,no! you're wrong! check again!
36032,Homer,then you have a serious reading problem.
28036,Homer,what a day for a stroll.
15687,Homer,"sure it is, honey. you do mean stealing, don't you?"
26969,Homer,shuttle's in the hangar!
21274,Homer,"okay, before i show ya, who wants to guess how i got the money?"
15854,Homer,"marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
36538,Homer,"aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
36494,Homer,wow. wow. this is like the night hillary won the new hampshire primary.
36294,Homer,i'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
15577,Homer,i'll give it a good home.
31796,Homer,did i attach the harness?
23533,Homer,i think so. the bone stopped the bullet.
30755,Homer,"well boy, you made the right choice. i think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us."
20756,Homer,thank you so much.
22586,Homer,"oh, i'm sure of it!"
24652,Homer,stop streaming over the wall! at least wait till i'm through talking.
32883,Homer,you're alive! and you baked a pie!
16006,Homer,"oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! oh wait, it's for bart."
35295,Homer,why you little...?!
20293,Homer,"nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
40069,Homer,he thinks he's so big.
34682,Homer,"half an hour to show time, your ugliness."
24011,Homer,"not anymore. ladies, say hello to..."
35765,Homer,"just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
24857,Homer,"here it is, everybody! the world's greatest website!"

37117,Homer,i forget.
32254,Homer,it's paint. or is it?
23054,Homer,"that's not how i remember it. besides, if we want to see japanese people we could have gone to the zoo."
36552,Homer,why you little...
24724,Homer,i said i was sorry.
34258,Homer,"i'm sorry i missed dinner, honey. we still have time to catch a movie. that can be romantic."

23108,Homer,see? everything's fine.
38225,Homer,"""congratulations on your purchase of a footmaster brand soccer ball."" thanks, book!"
36508,Homer,"pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
33979,Homer,"well, i... uh..."
34472,Homer,no food allowed in bank?
40234,Homer,"oh. my dreams will go unfulfilled! oh no. i don't like the sound of that one bit. that means i have nothing to hope for. marge, make it better. please. can't you make it better, huh?"
23970,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, pirates got your yacht."
35698,Homer,is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
32724,Homer,nothing!
29659,Homer,"sorry, boy. this is the only place that's two hundred feet from lisa but still on our property."
36849,Homer,"but if me and my kids do the same stuff as terence and his kids, i could be a cool dad."
39590,Homer,"kid, tonight's not your night."
15820,Homer,"oh, marge, what if i wind up as some vegetable, watching tv on the couch? my important work will never be completed."
21835,Homer,"okay, okay, it was me. i'm sorry i blew your secret. but you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. i just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. reflected glory!"
24522,Homer,"hey, hey, stop it!"
13740,Homer,"you know if you need a hat check girl, i've got a daughter."
30675,Homer,mason fairbanks...
29445,Homer,"we'll make it, dad. on a wing and a prayer."

30732,Homer,"so, i see you're also traveling with your son. what boy prison are you taking him to?"
31586,Homer,wait a minute. how am i breathing?

20704,Homer,"here's money, kids! take what you need!"
27701,Homer,"that's it! thank you, outdoor advertising! you saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
28439,Homer,now calm down. i'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
17687,Homer,that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. we began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
38936,Homer,"hey, is that time right? i have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
16110,Homer,"marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. they'll solve all our problems. they'll elevate us to the status of kings on earth."
26323,Homer,"well, i don't know. the demolition derby is next month..."
15181,Homer,i'll get it son.
41198,Homer,she said that?
33819,Homer,"oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! you're always gonna be friends with milhouse. stand by me / oh, stand by me..."
21153,Homer,i had no idea.
14832,Homer,please please please please please...
27205,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
35784,Homer,bo-ring.
17420,Homer,i need a hug.
13461,Homer,it was the olden days!
38504,Homer,betrayed by my worst enemy. i never would have seen it coming.
15991,Homer,but we were about to learn an iron law of show business: what goes up must come down.
37979,Homer,woo-hoo!
17282,Homer,can't. frozen.
27792,Homer,"sweetie, daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
17498,Homer,"ah, come on, everybody. this bar is like a tavern to me."
30513,Homer,i can do that!
16061,Homer,"relax, a photo can't make any difference."
36108,Homer,this yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! from her show!
17160,Homer,huh? wuzz wrong? house run away? dog's on fire?
32989,Homer,no problem.
22169,Homer,did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
19027,Homer,you have a desk?
19943,Homer,"oh, yes! gather 'round, my son, and i shall tell you a tale..."
40693,Homer,wow! of all the luck! to think i almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
40501,Homer,"you know, marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
39694,Homer,no we don't. try being objective for once in your... oooh!
37656,Homer,"strong man, moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. leave my trailer forever!"
39348,Homer,who's the lard butt?
18414,Homer,"washing my fat guy hat, honey."
38064,Homer,it's even better than i thought... you've found your moe szyslak! in just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of journey.
34913,Homer,you're gonna be okay.
32649,Homer,like which kid's their favorite! it's lisa.
21422,Homer,run!
40503,Homer,it's no trouble. i've got a whole garageful of tools i never use.
26595,Homer,taxi!
32849,Homer,"stupid charities, they think i'm gonna give them money? save the children? save your breath. take a hike, sierra club! doctors without borders? doctors without money! hey, greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! robert redford? guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
34849,Homer,thank you.
24171,Homer,"well, i'm not not licking toads... well, it's time to get to work. humanitarian homer simpson, over and out."
35303,Homer,"oh c'mon, now you're a tree?"
21317,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. go ahead. try and grab some flab. go on. ju--"
35050,Homer,he's washing his hands.
39935,Homer,four.
13660,Homer,"hmm, let's see."
29095,Homer,it was pretty delicious.
18637,Homer,"table five, table five..."
34487,Homer,"i'm there every day, five to eleven."
38111,Homer,"oh, when does the exercise start?"
22055,Homer,"say, who are you guys?"
18411,Homer,"oooo! ""an urgent plea from edward james olmos!"" ""lisa simpson: can you afford to miss another issue of the utne reader?"" kids."
39586,Homer,you little... ruff! ruff! ruff!
35154,Homer,woo hoo!
25910,Homer,because i... ow! you--!
15764,Homer,mmm. gratzi.
40567,Homer,"well, marge, what do you think?"
29975,Homer,"how much is got, wolfgang schmuck?"
18164,Homer,i've got no time for your demented parlor games! you won't be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you.
21204,Homer,sorry ned. i didn't see you down there. got him.
15176,Homer,but then i won't be watching tv. you can see the bind i'm in.
23344,Homer,he's definitely dead!
21187,Homer,"yes, but the memories will last a lifetime."
21432,Homer,"you know, um, it is a special occasion..."
23484,Homer,"from the producers of ""waiting to exhale."""
17156,Homer,nooooooo! my sugar is melting! melting! oh what a world!
38058,Homer,sit. sit. sit! sit! sit!!!
13954,Homer,going for... eight hour walk.
38342,Homer,hey! where's my junk?
21726,Homer,going where?
16878,Homer,wee!
36447,Homer,"oh lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?"
27196,Homer,"with the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup."
30584,Homer,huh. i was wrong.
19327,Homer,'cause marge and i have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
32860,Homer,"one, two, three... another chute?!"
38942,Homer,no i'm not.
31362,Homer,predator drone!
18681,Homer,"look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
28600,Homer,why... do... i... suck?
28170,Homer,ow! i'll reap! i'll reap already!
30752,Homer,"kidding! i'm kidding! we can do that, we have a special friendship."
30003,Homer,"wait. yes, it's staying down. oh no, it's not! yes it is. no it's not! yep. no. yep. no! yep. no! yep. no. yep. no. yep. no."
20601,Homer,"i don't know, marge. trying is the first step toward failure."
26275,Homer,count fudge-ula? i thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
17063,Homer,yes ma'am.
38264,Homer,"like most of my problems, it all started at moe's..."
40533,Homer,"well, i always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
34540,Homer,"gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. the kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
18128,Homer,"you kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this."
34881,Homer,you can race pigeons?
40218,Homer,"come on, marge."
18342,Homer,two!
38233,Homer,you don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
28634,Homer,"son, did you ever suspect it was me?"
41357,Homer,got to stay mad. the next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
30865,Homer,"later, if i have enough energy, we can walk up to the tv and i'll show you how thin it is."
22489,Homer,"uh-uh, no way. i don't want to miss a word."
39609,Homer,"yeah, how much is it?"
37036,Homer,"eat silver, copper!"
29488,Homer,catch your flight?
27830,Homer,the only dangerous amount is none!
22125,Homer,"you're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. now promise, or i'll let you fall to your death."
24890,Homer,they're with god now.
20269,Homer,safe at last.
25768,Homer,"please let me win this, lord. 'cause if you don't..."
34164,Homer,no pink box?! wha -- what's going on?
15493,Homer,bed goes up. bed goes down...
34183,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. with me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride."
26433,Homer,just you wait!
41107,Homer,"i can't tell you how sorry i am, dad."
30424,Homer,why you metal...!
39091,Homer,"i'm so sorry i threw you across the room and called you a liar. when you told me i was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. it was a poem you were writing about my potential. i'm gonna start celebrating my size and i need you with me as a partner. now if you'll excuse me, i need to talk to the broken porch swing."
15286,Homer,the batmobile!
16528,Homer,aw. just like on tv.
29710,Homer,now let's see... which one is ling?
15691,Homer,where?
37394,Homer,is that the radon detector?
14804,Homer,"listen, tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. what do you say to that?"
26150,Homer,"son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of god."
13568,Homer,"that's all right, son."
17739,Homer,"it's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, marge."
16385,Homer,i'll take it.
40916,Homer,remember? who could forget?
21901,Homer,work!? but you're hippies!
33054,Homer,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
14992,Homer,"so i figure i should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
14653,Homer,"marge, that's just a suggested car size."
31094,Homer,"yeah, i have their baseball cards."
24097,Homer,hello? mailman?
36565,Homer,"i swear, i am not filming."
14223,Homer,puke.
13909,Homer,no. i need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
31651,Homer,"hey, that jerk cut us off! pull alongside!"
39860,Homer,"oh, maggie. my poor back."
21792,Homer,"okay, fine. but i could do all kinds of stuff for you. i noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
23246,Homer,"but how do we know, marge? how do we know?"
23066,Homer,"hey, you know, i once knew a man from nantucket."
20779,Homer,and when is this weekend?
41033,Homer,"bullseye! and another thing. when i gun the motor, i want people to think the world is coming to an end! vroom! vroom! vroom!"
40941,Homer,is that selma? ring-a-ding-ding!
23888,Homer,i forgot my float!
30216,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. no matter what i did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
20438,Homer,"not any more. from now on, you're my main man. okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. oh, rod, you don't have to. you're cut."
15651,Homer,he's got my hotdog!
33867,Homer,why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
31145,Homer,"shut up, my ten o'clock's here."
22951,Homer,"well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
39500,Homer,"oh, yes, doctor."
22062,Homer,even the sea won't forgive me.
22100,Homer,"look out, marge! cat!"
37921,Homer,"yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""taken"" where the ""hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""fast and furious."""
23081,Homer,"oh, i'm sick of doing japanese stuff. in jail we had to be in this dumb kabuki play about the forty-seven ronin and i wanted to be oshi, but they made me ori."
32428,Homer,a better one!
14293,Homer,mon-ey.
22871,Homer,"no, these guys are geniuses. i could never think of something like soup or a pencil."
13556,Homer,wow. how do you do that thing with your feet?
38180,Homer,our cushion!
30893,Homer,"i see. well, i should be getting to the living room..."
35013,Homer,are you gonna kill me now? 'cause i'm super ready.
21231,Homer,potato man.
13508,Homer,twenty eight minutes till burns comes. time for operation mail take.
23873,Homer,"uh, miracle boy?"
18696,Homer,really?
25233,Homer,i love the theater.
34707,Homer,i would kill for that.
29233,Homer,i say when we're full. you don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
39907,Homer,"ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. let's check it out."
31672,Homer,actually... that was me.
37063,Homer,clearly the boy's in shock.
28469,Homer,why should america consume ninety percent of the world's resources? argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
15346,Homer,this is all my fault. i've gotta save him.
24303,Homer,hey? how did i get out here?
16701,Homer,"fine. oh, i mean not good."
26854,Homer,"hey, i'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- oh-ho-ho, you mean me? i'd be delighted."
32417,Homer,brown? no. orange? no. elm? rake? guessing?
34778,Homer,why do pie makers get all the girls?
15541,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
32639,Homer,is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as i am?
38501,Homer,i'm the lame ass? the only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
15052,Homer,where'd you get all the money?
20218,Homer,no need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
26499,Homer,"oh yeah, i checked that out when bart was born. i was gonna read to him every day."
29165,Homer,"if that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. we'll lose tourists! and then who will buy my roadside corn?"
16544,Homer,oh sure... remember when i got caught stealing all those watches from sears?
15016,Homer,"marge, turn down the heat. that's better."
20655,Homer,"is this car $15,000?"
25328,Homer,"well, look who's here. you two are goin' down."
30878,Homer,don't lean out of the tra--
35697,Homer,here it is: 1501 east oak. no name on the door -- very trendy.
33743,Homer,"hey, there we go."
27918,Homer,"well, i guess we could afford one nice trip."
13293,Homer,beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer!
17462,Homer,"hoo mama! this is finally really happening. after years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, i know i'm gonna get rich with this scheme! and quick!"
39322,Homer,"oh, no. he can't mean that."
17858,Homer,"show 'em what american butts are made of, son!"
16418,Homer,i mean... you know if we wanted to... not that i... ever did.
41400,Homer,are you god?
28575,Homer,either way. the important thing is the system works.
15600,Homer,"hmm, i keep thinking i'm forgetting something."
22569,Homer,"don't worry, honey. daddy will fix that broken animal."
16513,Homer,"marge, you waited for me."
27539,Homer,i guess i learned something here. god is capable of great anger and great mercy. but mostly great anger.
37093,Homer,now i can finally complete my bucket list.
35917,Homer,this is going so great. i'm already a halloween mask.
41152,Homer,"don't you know anything, boy? that's ringo starr."
35835,Homer,how would you know?
19593,Homer,now what?
19844,Homer,look at me! i'm the prime minister of ireland!
28893,Homer,"all right. for you, i will give up all clear liquors."
17964,Homer,this contest is over. give that man the ten thousand dollars!
37333,Homer,wow. wow. this is the most delicious analogy i've ever eaten. i need to share this insight with marge. put this in your finest styrofoam!
39635,Homer,"okay, nobody move. nobody panic. when i give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. on the count of three. one..."
20030,Homer,wow.
20143,Homer,come o-o-on! come o-o-on!
29083,Homer,"it was years ago, when i was ten. back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
22258,Homer,would you rather tell maude the truth?
33280,Homer,run for your--
28063,Homer,"no, it's true. the car, the soup... it's like you hate me... your own husband..."
23159,Homer,here comes two!
28533,Homer,i'm not looking for glory or wealth. i'm just buying that stairway to heaven jesus sang of.
20546,Homer,fossils shmossils. you can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. bones shmones.
33321,Homer,"when you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
17770,Homer,"wait a minute. we all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. that's you, flanders."
13218,Homer,i don't know why i ever sold you to him.
29711,Homer,ling?... ling?... ling?...
41500,Homer,"marge, please, i'm busy."
14522,Homer,where'd you get the money?
34957,Homer,i repeat: unable to exercise...
17864,Homer,how am i going to tell marge we're broke? i need a miracle.
38505,Homer,i finally got over my sea sickness.
13803,Homer,gladly.
23490,Homer,ta-da!
25273,Homer,"hey, check it out! i'm surfing the net!"
29042,Homer,"pie man is not your father, little girl. i... murdered your father."
40562,Homer,"oh, what? what is it?"
31844,Homer,i said foul on twenty-three!
27236,Homer,"okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! annnd... none."
34650,Homer,thirty-nine.
39325,Homer,what do we need a psychiatrist for? we know our kid is nuts.
25545,Homer,my old lunch box!
19831,Homer,"all right, all right, geez. okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
40960,Homer,"oh. hee, hee. sorry."
21392,Homer,"excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?"
36785,Homer,"dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
33016,Homer,i'll tell you what's over! this partnership!
21854,Homer,"oh, i'll never outrun them in a museum!"
13348,Homer,could you... give me a handful of peanuts... maude?
39423,Homer,"but, don't worry. i've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
13707,Homer,"i know, but... wait a minute. i'm homer simpson. ned flanders lives over there."
39031,Homer,"uh, i'd like to offer you something... but all i've got is coffee... with cream!"
14621,Homer,uh... mr. burns... i need to borrow some money.
19196,Homer,you... didn't?
34244,Homer,fine. let me just get my harness pads.
22979,Homer,"all right, a gross-out contest! grandma plopwell, you've done it again."
31023,Homer,how did this happen?
20487,Homer,i have this much.
30339,Homer,no one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
22380,Homer,you're thinking of all the other years. this year's shows are classics.
35824,Homer,"hey kids, i'm it!"
27026,Homer,lisa!
35583,Homer,where's that spider?
21359,Homer,"my dad's a disgrace, just like bart's dad. me."
14403,Homer,"don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
35640,Homer,is this her?
38024,Homer,"spied on her with a hidden camera. she thinks i'm selfish, she thinks i don't spend enough time with the kids..."
18329,Homer,"help me! are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
32720,Homer,"i, uh, i have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. conservation of mass -- it's the law."
36065,Homer,"pish tosh, smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! nailed it!"
38164,Homer,what'll it take to buy your silence?
13772,Homer,"uh, magic. what if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
28338,Homer,back cuts?
34995,Homer,ayyyy!
15456,Homer,"don't worry, marge. america's healthcare system is second only to japan... canada, sweden, great britain. well, all of europe. but you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in paraguay."
41578,Homer,a hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
14675,Homer,"okay, fudd me."
38971,Homer,lisa...
33005,Homer,"so, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
16013,Homer,go home.
23224,Homer,"oh, this thing'll do anything. watch, i'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. no, wait... i'll make it say ""whatsa matta you?"" in turkish."
23212,Homer,"son, let's forget all about that drug thing. why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
25135,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, i give you your moron!"
30327,Homer,"okay, how about this? seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. everyone forget that."
21576,Homer,"ooh, look at all the inventions edison came up with. the stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. and look at him dance."
18269,Homer,that's it! go to your room!
41168,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
36085,Homer,that's not a choice you get to make.
13868,Homer,"please, you've got to open that store."
37844,Homer,well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. but only for a week. got a lot of ice cream comin' in.
26449,Homer,stop saying that.
23697,Homer,woo-hoo!
23531,Homer,i don't know why we ever left in the first place.
23524,Homer,"lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is..."
20416,Homer,"hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, flanders. go wildcats!"
31662,Homer,bart... buddy! it's your dad! i need a ride! i think i'm in chinatown. not our chinatown.
14911,Homer,make bart do it.
39722,Homer,are you?
31603,Homer,are you gonna torture me?
26888,Homer,"this whole thing was a joke? oh, i've never been so relieved! relieved and angry."
25463,Homer,"oh, i'm wasting away. i'm down to a b-cup."
15375,Homer,once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad.
19595,Homer,"but marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet."
37062,Homer,"were you worried about me, boy?"
41256,Homer,something said: not good...
22625,Homer,hm. that thought never occurred to me. funny how your mind works in a crisis.
15021,Homer,"hey, wait a minute... flanders is a regular charlie church and god didn't save his house!"
34259,Homer,it'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
14153,Homer,huh? what?
37901,Homer,and best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
28620,Homer,"and if anything happens to me, i want you bullies to take care of my boy."
18652,Homer,"first bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way i talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! well, that's it!"
38376,Homer,i just did that because it was a series of funny words!
27074,Homer,"hey, what gives? where are all the rock stars?"
30605,Homer,"hey, that guy in first class is taking a tv out of his armrest."
37702,Homer,"yeah, well listen, pal. i have my treasure: my wife and my children."
20519,Homer,"when i get old, marge, i want you to promise you'll put me in a home. it's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
15993,Homer,shut up!
28074,Homer,gotta go.
35527,Homer,wayne?
33843,Homer,marge! i'm glad you came. there's a kegger down the hall. we can go as soon as i desecrate this corpse.
25897,Homer,"yeah, they're italian."
13270,Homer,then why were you moaning last time?
34019,Homer,i recommend / our dear old friend / bartender moe szyslak!
35272,Homer,now i have to work overtime--
39007,Homer,perfect! just like when we let you name maggie.
41109,Homer,yell-o.
32885,Homer,"mom, i can't believe you're here. you keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. you're just like that show ""scrubs""."
17977,Homer,can i have some?
39928,Homer,and he had a big nose.
14280,Homer,"and tomorrow morning, i'm gonna buy your ring back! then i'm going house-hunting!"
23971,Homer,"i don't know. after living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump."
23145,Homer,"okay, while mel and i are working, why don't you guys do the town? i hear all the stars eat at a place called planet hollywood."
29829,Homer,"well, maybe i was partying so hard with my single friends last night, i forgot the rules."
26128,Homer,and someone has eaten the flesh.
36274,Homer,"and here i was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. you know, it's crazy, but..."
27388,Homer,mom? don't you think i could read the report by myself?
40963,Homer,"oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. please..."
18320,Homer,my stomach sticks way out in front and my...
35787,Homer,"oh, well..."
32164,Homer,"marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. that's why i've decided to go to the plant and beg mr. burns for my old job back."
39163,Homer,moe szyslak!
27995,Homer,"to me that says ""i love you."""
30861,Homer,"you're right, lenny. i..."
22391,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
17258,Homer,"well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
19910,Homer,"marge, mail's here."
18618,Homer,"uh, spray the boy."
26295,Homer,rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... this is the gay pride parade! woo hoo!
14366,Homer,"that's right. my god, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
16559,Homer,"marge, they're only human."
25139,Homer,"i've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the nuclear regulatory commission."
16232,Homer,stupid tv. be more funny.
22418,Homer,"yeah, but why does the homer simpson character have to be so stupid?"
13871,Homer,number four and a half -- stupid gum!
14509,Homer,"look, we're past that. marge, maybe i do curse a little, but that's the way god made me. and i'm too old to stop now."
30995,Homer,i've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
19098,Homer,"well! what do you think of me and cypress creek now, marge?"
16417,Homer,and we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
22905,Homer,it's fun for the whole family. and the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
21306,Homer,"i've got to keep trying! or i could just move that picture. no! the picture looked good where it was. boy, drag me back outside."
41305,Homer,how stupid are you?
28577,Homer,"marge, wait."
18928,Homer,"low and lazy, so -- hey! say something again."
22427,Homer,nobody snuggles with max power. you strap yourself in and feel the g's.
14131,Homer,hey... hey!
19653,Homer,"marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
26046,Homer,and here you go.
21500,Homer,dads especially!
18098,Homer,"i'll just be a second, marge. i'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
36699,Homer,aww.
36497,Homer,"okay, i'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... i'm on the wrong tree... okay, try again... here we go, okay..."
18787,Homer,hello. mr. burns' office.
40030,Homer,hmmm huh.
24554,Homer,bingo!
17531,Homer,permit me to solve the mystery. your mother has a fear of flying.
32414,Homer,"boy, stop talking to yourself!"
16615,Homer,"so, mr. molloy. it seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
25640,Homer,"oh, crap. it's on fire!"
14202,Homer,someday i'll buy you a real castle.
26203,Homer,i knew it!
37925,Homer,you? how could you? you're my own flesh and blood!
34819,Homer,"maggie, you can't climb into the tv. if you could, i'd make alex trebek answer some questions."
29271,Homer,but she'll still win the contest?
17121,Homer,"ah...there's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool."
16031,Homer,"relax, marge. i tied up all the loose ends before we left."
21157,Homer,"oooh, the gum with the cracker center. mmm."
39490,Homer,"hey, no pain, no gain."
40565,Homer,you mean duke it out?
22247,Homer,ginger throws ned a kiss.
17674,Homer,"did you hear me? i said, i quit, monty. and since i quit, i can do anything i want."
14226,Homer,i don't know.
34829,Homer,"oh i'm sorry, maggie, but even at your age, i'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... i can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
35060,Homer,"bart, son, if i bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it."
37642,Homer,with an emerald that big i could buy anything -- a jalopy! an icebox! a steamer trunk full of fedoras! but how do i get my hands on it?
22694,Homer,"he called me ""greenhorn."" i called him tony randall. it was a thing we had."
39218,Homer,"okay, kids. prepare to be dazzled. marge! turn on the juice!"
29522,Homer,woo-hoo!
25454,Homer,but homer simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... hey!
22223,Homer,welcome to my world.
15000,Homer,yeah... think about it.
35870,Homer,i just don't understand the world of grownups.
16033,Homer,bart! don't interrupt!
36366,Homer,worth it to be ri-ight! worth it to be ri-ight!
31255,Homer,"who'd you think would help me, my wife? heh."

38311,Homer,a friend from high school.
17613,Homer,what's this?
36221,Homer,"you're outta here, drug-o."
18009,Homer,the man at the stand said it was a record!
27454,Homer,then we'll have to smoke her out.
36370,Homer,"boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
23389,Homer,i can still hear his voice on the wind.
22086,Homer,"mr. hamill, mr. mayor, come on!"
35810,Homer,"it all fits. mr. burns, rafting it is."
34139,Homer,stupid grampa. i try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
30193,Homer,"flanders. okay, that's it. really irritating!"
23809,Homer,"that's not true, he left it on the bus."
40036,Homer,"got ya, burnsie."
33384,Homer,"virgin? what are you, a girl?"
20670,Homer,"run for your lives, everyone! this is not a drill!"

16828,Homer,"the flanderses are not geeks! okay, rod and todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. but we've got to give this thing a chance. i want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
35511,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him, expecting him to be larry right away. by the way, where is larry?"
28790,Homer,the re-deadening? is that any good?
39751,Homer,hold on! hold on now! your mother hasn't opened my present yet.

16693,Homer,are we in india yet?
26471,Homer,semper fi.
18272,Homer,"bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
33188,Homer,anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
22376,Homer,door?
34021,Homer,"of course i do, marge. can you still love a man who's half-beer?"
15040,Homer,"honey, what's wrong?"
27160,Homer,"well, what about bart?"
24323,Homer,you keep thinkin' that.
39145,Homer,"princess, why did you put on that coat? you're obviously cold. may i escort you to the radiator?"
17560,Homer,that's just the engine powering up. that's just the engine struggling.
35961,Homer,what? my emotions were so powerful...
13610,Homer,hmph?
21954,Homer,unless...
28104,Homer,"uh, i'm giving it back to the earth."
25155,Homer,"oh, that would be heaven!"
27864,Homer,"calm down, picky ricardo. he made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
17081,Homer,"aw, marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
41287,Homer,you idiot! mr. fatso is you!
25503,Homer,it...
30520,Homer,the first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
31154,Homer,let's compromise and say nobody said it.
31627,Homer,"yes, my love?"
38238,Homer,"give the donuts to the hotel staff. release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild."
30810,Homer,"well, i guess i should explain. not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so i was out in the forest, hiding."
26044,Homer,"all right, i'm sorry... but i will not save the rainforest."
20009,Homer,oh. a five thirteen. i'll handle it.
15155,Homer,oh yeah. the trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
30939,Homer,"this isn't india! where's the university of notre dame, the indy 500, wrigley field, dodger dogs --?"
35610,Homer,"hello, young man burns."
18570,Homer,woo hoo! we won! we won!

40271,Homer,"well, i'm ready to punch in."
13507,Homer,oops.
21639,Homer,awdammit!
35074,Homer,"well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends."
32796,Homer,"don't worry, you can stay with us. i'm sure marge will be cool."
16787,Homer,y- no.
41270,Homer,"you can stay, but i'm leaving."
20627,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
21978,Homer,"pinchy, i made you some risotto."
15284,Homer,do you come with the car?
39140,Homer,'cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. the dirty dozen? all guys. twelve angry men? men! the x-men? mostly men.
14115,Homer,i own stock?
28448,Homer,"i can't neuter you, boy. not after all we've been through."
14941,Homer,"yeah, like when i pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
38676,Homer,"hey, i haven't had a drink in a thousand years."
21774,Homer,higher!
32204,Homer,well i didn't mean to!
22962,Homer,"whew, that was one long helicopter ride."
22972,Homer,god! it's him!
32563,Homer,"i've gotta find out who that guy is, but i need help. someone like bart, only smart. lisa!"
38201,Homer,"oh, great. the painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. and when marge finds out she's gonna kill me."

25967,Homer,"now, ya see, that's what i'm talkin' about. you're always pointing that shotgun at us."
31572,Homer,"aw, son."

28745,Homer,ee-yow!
21946,Homer,brunch is served!
13901,Homer,i'll take it!
28976,Homer,"what kind of an airline routes all their flights through nome, alaska?"
31019,Homer,"so... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?"
17585,Homer,then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
33533,Homer,"aw, rats in the kitchen. just like that delightful movie i taped in the theater."
22955,Homer,"gee, i feel bad. if people knew the real monty burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
40984,Homer,what does it look like?
36460,Homer,"ooo, licorice!"
28800,Homer,sorry. i forgot i bought the soundtrack album.
24262,Homer,"oh, i'm tired of giving you money. why can't you be more like lisa?"
17443,Homer,ooooookay.

18223,Homer,"hi, is milhouse home?"
40887,Homer,just a select circle of my friends.
27736,Homer,"moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years."
28693,Homer,i knew it! and what about the romance between you and cyrus?
30980,Homer,"stupid flandish. uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little bible-thumping in the crow's nest? what do you say, miss..."
40519,Homer,"oh. well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?"
13835,Homer,"slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. end of monster. heh heh heh."
27122,Homer,i'll do four.
26702,Homer,that was at my expense. what kind of a roast is this?
33265,Homer,i want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. and i thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
28057,Homer,pretty good. thanks for asking.
29893,Homer,"goodbye, ray! bye! oh, he turned the corner. ooh! now i see him again!"
39854,Homer,"quiet! i have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. it's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. no, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. and you know something, folks? as ridiculous as it sounds, i would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as i sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's g-string. am i wrong, or am i right?"
30888,Homer,"because we'll be on tv, and earn enough money to buy a tv. tv."
30299,Homer,"i love you, marge."
34985,Homer,oh yeah. i got in your gang and you barely know who i am.
23690,Homer,i remember television!
28212,Homer,"marge, wake up! the newspaper is talking to me!"
26651,Homer,"and ""otto"" is ""otto"" backwards."
26618,Homer,i hate getting stitches in my eyes. stupid crows.
38375,Homer,let them ruck the night away!
14037,Homer,"wow, i'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
16272,Homer,fine! i can have a great time all by myself!
16517,Homer,marge...
36049,Homer,i mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
22018,Homer,"c'mon, doc. there's gotta be something i can do to help my dad."
22041,Homer,oh.

14622,Homer,i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
33938,Homer,"marge, speak to me."
15762,Homer,woo hoo!
21456,Homer,hmmm...
20407,Homer,"huh, big deal. i've been carried out of moe's like that hundreds of times."
33869,Homer,"c'mon, boy! be cool!"
20186,Homer,bart was feeling mighty blue...
33092,Homer,"he rhymes! oh, happy day!"
15625,Homer,uh... revenge.
24534,Homer,"we put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the sunday comic strip."
17476,Homer,out.
30392,Homer,"right... right... right... right... okay... right. i love you, bye!"
15606,Homer,bart!
20809,Homer,i've joined the movementarians! and so have all of you!
36021,Homer,i'm getting' closer. it's just within reach.
34459,Homer,g-g-g-g-hags!
15736,Homer,one down. twenty-nine to go.
22144,Homer,"yesss! nobody messes with the mayor when homer simpson's on -- aw, crap."
17981,Homer,"oh, ah, but mr. milhouse, my little girl's getting married!"
22470,Homer,i can't lose them!
24965,Homer,what the?!
19995,Homer,chair goes round... chair goes round.
21361,Homer,"this is for you, son."
17225,Homer,what's that?
19923,Homer,"no! bart had his turn, let me! i can't resist his charms."
32092,Homer,"now make every word ""beer."""
38214,Homer,there's sausage being made? where?
21740,Homer,all right. i got it. come on. get... off the...
34988,Homer,oh no! no! i... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
30849,Homer,uh-oh.
24518,Homer,"helloooo, iowa! does anyone have a donut?"
34083,Homer,"mmm, not bad."
38128,Homer,"lisa got to you. i don't know how, but she got to you."
19192,Homer,never.
31648,Homer,now what do they want?
20561,Homer,"no one's calling it an angel, lisa. if you'll look carefully, you'll notice i never once used the word ""angel""."
13491,Homer,yeah...
17306,Homer,this is gonna cost me.
14702,Homer,"marge, you make it sound so seamy. all i did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
14442,Homer,"what? you mean we're getting a divorce? marge, i can change!"
25307,Homer,"hello, bart. how are the tennis partners?"
16642,Homer,ah. oliver north. he was just poured into that uniform.
28388,Homer,"i did a lot of stuff today. i went to starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
36258,Homer,"so, bart, the little dickens, is going through that phase where young boys think their dad's an idiot."
25215,Homer,"wait a minute, no investor could bend like that."
26062,Homer,"burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go."
28505,Homer,isn't it sufficient.
13820,Homer,"ooh, a luxury car. good baby. good maggie."
39991,Homer,"come on, marge. let me carry you over the threshold."
25189,Homer,"well, there's a dull ache, certainly. and overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. only instead of bacon, there's agony. marge, can i have a blt?"
34827,Homer,drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... i'll show 'em -- i'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
18931,Homer,"wow. you must love this country more than i love a cold beer on a hot christmas morning. darn it, apu, i'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
36410,Homer,sorry.
25007,Homer,i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
39065,Homer,stop fearing me!
30938,Homer,"thanks, sweetie. i've never been less angry to receive a book."
30306,Homer,you know everything.
27355,Homer,what are you buying? jerk stuff?
34158,Homer,"fortunately there was one man who could help: colonel tom parker. the colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""the rolling stones."" the first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. but those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."
17430,Homer,precious venus...
32405,Homer,"don't worry, boy. they'll find your parents soon."
36278,Homer,"axels to axels, rust to rust, amen."
16725,Homer,stupid carbon rod. it's all just a popularity contest.
17295,Homer,"oh, my loving family. nothing's changed."
14745,Homer,i'm sorry lurleen. all i wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and i've done that. now i better get out of here before i lose my family.
25288,Homer,i'm getting to that.
29580,Homer,a flying rock! call a geologist!
34114,Homer,"oh, c'mon! look out! what would that guy-- look out! that's funny."
35522,Homer,"you know, i just got a little chill when you said my name."
15100,Homer,"... so then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
24105,Homer,"hey, i'm as surprised as you, but i've stumbled upon the most delicious british sit-com."
35484,Homer,"you stupid jerks! i can't believe you could be so cruel! especially you, joey kramer!"
18087,Homer,but you thought they were.
20709,Homer,"obviously, i don't. now if you'll get out of my way..."
14462,Homer,maggie?
29812,Homer,there's gonna be a breakout tonight.
25822,Homer,"guys, i am not cursed!"
24773,Homer,"yes, go on..."
34857,Homer,why did burns make us all come here?
37831,Homer,what the?
27859,Homer,"nice to meet you, stuart."
24634,Homer,stop right there.
17542,Homer,"every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. well what about me, marge?"
29521,Homer,you wanna do my dance after you score?
29104,Homer,i just blew my first chance at true love.
27895,Homer,"so, she didn't hate me. she married me because she loved me!"
22641,Homer,somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
24216,Homer,that one.
38098,Homer,"honey, grampa is the closest thing i have to a father and i love him. but three octogenocerouses?"
16698,Homer,well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the kwik-e-mart?
13746,Homer,"eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
34268,Homer,"let us curl, m'lady. let us throw and sweep a'twain until the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! and afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. and if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of november, we shall proclaim that we were curling!"
14553,Homer,ha ha. cops can't win!
33616,Homer,"reverend lovejoy? you deliver pizza now? but we didn't order a pizza. but you forgot the pizza anyway. marge, the pizza place screwed up again."

23109,Homer,"hey, dolphins."
17061,Homer,"oh, you mean about you. all right, maybe i said some things -- some personal things. but, you should have seen 'em, marge. they really wanted to hear what i had to say."
16861,Homer,"oh dear god, no."
39919,Homer,"sorry, marge. some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle."
37362,Homer,"funny how the brain does that, huh?"
17974,Homer,i'll take ten.
33651,Homer,"marge, i hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. you always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is i. with each marriage i get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, i'll be worthy of you."
30400,Homer,"of all the people for marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
15998,Homer,are we hot?
17879,Homer,"gosh, moe, i use these all the time. couldn't you just bash my head in?"
13145,Homer,"ooo la la, a girl with teeth. me like!"
24201,Homer,"well, i may not know much about god, but i have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for him."

41217,Homer,mmm... bacon.
24135,Homer,quick! you've got to hide me from pbs! their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the chubb group!
24426,Homer,"you know, killing that gator was the best decision i ever made."
41441,Homer,"forget it, doc! what if that's my marriage in there?"
21669,Homer,ball two. this bozo's gonna walk me.
25423,Homer,"well, is that it?"
33275,Homer,they're gonna blow it up!
30987,Homer,"people, this is madness! we can burn the witch later! right now, i've got to save this ship!"
38334,Homer,"oooh, ""goody gobble""!"
29758,Homer,are you crazy? let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
13157,Homer,who are you?

30915,Homer,so... homer do good?
36713,Homer,oh my god! you want me to help you escape?
17672,Homer,don't worry about homer j. i've got a plan. a plan that'll fix you good.
28947,Homer,because i'm successfully married.
35562,Homer,"aww, that's what i call closure!"
32666,Homer,"i mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach."
28688,Homer,"i'll have to read marge's book. and i swore never to read again after ""to kill a mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. it did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
29795,Homer,i'm not supposed to be new meat. i'm supposed to have your job.
32516,Homer,oh yeah!
27025,Homer,maggie!
33047,Homer,"bart! where are you, boy?! don't worry, i won't strangle you."

32502,Homer,i'd like to know if wes doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
26098,Homer,"so, how was your day? did anything unbelievable happen? phone calls, things of that nature?"
30360,Homer,and you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
35651,Homer,no.
25089,Homer,"oh. yes, of course. uh, she's behind that plant."
13882,Homer,"look, i let you down and i apologize. i know that doesn't make it right, but i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
38582,Homer,"there's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you."
18234,Homer,no.
17266,Homer,why should i kill my family?
22461,Homer,somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
17508,Homer,"wait a minute. there's something bothering me about this place. i know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. enjoy your death trap, ladies."

19182,Homer,"hey, what's this?"
17679,Homer,"and that is that. goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. hello dream job in paradise."
36075,Homer,we hate opera!
25887,Homer,"sure, boy."
13263,Homer,"yes, i have returned from the dead."
28320,Homer,"i understand the word ""gave."" unless it means something else in this country."
19940,Homer,"oh, okay."
15369,Homer,oh.
26263,Homer,it was dinner.

14916,Homer,"woo-hoo! come to papa! marge, i'll be out in the car."
20663,Homer,"i'm gonna kill you! / no, i'm killing him first! / why you little... bart, the next time you ever have... / you went too far..."
34728,Homer,i believe this stranger!
30538,Homer,what can i do? i'm only one man.
28321,Homer,"now, now, let's just look... there's big ben, there's piccadilly circus, there's jimmy page, one of the greatest thieves of american black music who ever walked the earth. bup, there's the kids."
33590,Homer,"you okay, dad?"

13549,Homer,the boy! this isn't fair! how can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
38056,Homer,"hey, you've said it twice, marge. you're in pretty deep."
33757,Homer,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, bart and lisa are gonna be failures. failures who work for... noah!"
35987,Homer,i don't trust this place. where are the cashiers?
28801,Homer,"who loves ya, baby?"
27008,Homer,"hey, i'm on vacation."
31820,Homer,i want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!
19789,Homer,"no, boy. you can't drive, you're only 10. you're going hunting!"
17349,Homer,"wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. to think of all the time i wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... i love you."
34517,Homer,"we're not gonna get whacked. because you're chief clancy wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this."
23343,Homer,he's dead!
23761,Homer,"now, let's see. this will make three christmases i saved versus eight i ruined... two were kind of a draw..."
23813,Homer,oh yeah. you were way off.
24822,Homer,what? lemme see that.
41442,Homer,"see what your monkeyshines have done, boy?!"
29866,Homer,my family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! they'll all be sorry when i invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!
41048,Homer,"oh, are you? well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard."
14983,Homer,it's good for what ails ya...
20551,Homer,i'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
39011,Homer,"you're the guy who put wheels on luggage? oh, bless you! bless you!"
18917,Homer,"woo-hoo! a perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
38151,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa..."

24790,Homer,do i get paid now?
21481,Homer,"yeah, i thought bart would be born a dimwit."
24533,Homer,"yes, go on."
36520,Homer,"you're sellin' milk, j.j., and i've got a sour stomach."
27097,Homer,we know!
13469,Homer,"it's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
29389,Homer,"son, when you grew up, i grew down. but now i can see you need your dad more than ever."
19896,Homer,"hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
23856,Homer,i'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
28921,Homer,"i'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. we're all out of triple a's, so i'm gonna whittle down a couple of these d's."
19163,Homer,"look, marge! they opened a new high-tech gadget store! you love high-tech gadgets!"
31818,Homer,nothing.
17526,Homer,"so marge, pretty sweet, eh?"

39615,Homer,how much do you want for it?
29917,Homer,"flanders, you saw ray on the roof with me!"
37105,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get 'em. unless we die on this icy mountain road. then they've won forever."
35525,Homer,men's room? oh my god! we're completing each other's...
40784,Homer,"bart, pay attention. you may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
39929,Homer,"no, bigger. and big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that."
36577,Homer,"listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy."

20447,Homer,"hey, everybody! let's hear it for bart!"
33399,Homer,"a lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. may i have this dance?"
22274,Homer,shut it off. they're losers.
40874,Homer,"look, look, marge. i can't afford it. when i can afford to pay for it, i will. but i can't, so i'm not going to."
18501,Homer,"hang on, boy! daddy's comin' to save ya!"
20564,Homer,pfft! facts are meaningless. you can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. facts shmacts.
35807,Homer,i'll handle it. i always do.
39473,Homer,i've got some wieners in my pocket.
39130,Homer,plant-watering guy.
29605,Homer,"let's see, ""name"" ""homer simpson""."
22798,Homer,"'scuse me, i have a few questions for pop."
36432,Homer,we used to be like them.
37073,Homer,goodbye forever!
25614,Homer,or is it the right?

16855,Homer,"get lost, flanders."

38600,Homer,you can't resist smoking in the house any more than i can resist drinking in the car.
26194,Homer,"okay, family huddle."
28742,Homer,you didn't sit on the toilet!
20651,Homer,"wow, this really restores your faith in..."
13531,Homer,"mmm, thanks -- it looks... hey, wait a minute! just because i'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean i'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! although it is tempting --"
36487,Homer,i appreciate that.
32670,Homer,that was the best christmas ever.
20787,Homer,yes. i am the highly suggestible type.
29092,Homer,"think, homer, think."
19006,Homer,...and i like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
27538,Homer,god's ignoring me.
15157,Homer,"all right. all right. bart, go to your room."
34102,Homer,"hm, people in other countries make love? it's about time."
27512,Homer,you was hiding behind the drywall. yes you were! i'm glad social services didn't see this. yes i am!
16160,Homer,"well, burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, i'll tell you that. he's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
13638,Homer,who's that?
18698,Homer,"just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, marge?"
28651,Homer,i'll do it!
32016,Homer,"ooh, a thermos! with seven cups of coffee still in it! oh wait, six!"
21629,Homer,yes?
21364,Homer,"oh, marge, i never thought you'd see me again."
25986,Homer,what's the gag?
36211,Homer,i'm cured. i'll never wet the bed again.
40548,Homer,a hundred bucks?
33432,Homer,great jokes make me hungry. i wonder what's in the pantry...
22385,Homer,he's named like my name!
13412,Homer,watch.
40697,Homer,"i love you, barney."
13165,Homer,"what a kiss. if i died now, i'd die happy."
39737,Homer,"of course i know! sure! you really thought i forgot, didn't you?"
37843,Homer,"look, you kill them, i get rid of them. that's always been our deal. but i do have one question: do you want the head?"
32331,Homer,"hmmm. well, marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
25906,Homer,why not? kids are very visual these days.
28151,Homer,i'll get our little passports.
32116,Homer,think positive. think positive.
40170,Homer,huh?
15237,Homer,"hello, what's this? wire hangers! expired medicine! old newspapers! okay homer, stay calm. just quietly get this stuff inside your house."
39384,Homer,damn!
15770,Homer,"hey, lenny, can you get this sugar daddy off my back?"
15318,Homer,"well wishing won't make it so. you've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn barney you can be."
14227,Homer,"finally, the big day came. we didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
14850,Homer,"oh, yeah. right. i don't know what this switch does."
30324,Homer,"i think they killed each other. you know, one of those murder-suicide deals."
32893,Homer,no! i can't forgive you -- and i don't accept your tuck-in!
13173,Homer,love... conquers... all.
26848,Homer,but what about the axe?
30670,Homer,i don't care what that letter said. this man raised me single-handedly. when i think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
25843,Homer,"yep, a machine."
19134,Homer,yes...
17327,Homer,"see, son? telling the truth isn't so bad."
13170,Homer,"i've gotta go, i've got a date!"
34953,Homer,"it's okay, it's okay. i can be out in eighteen months with good behavior."
33452,Homer,"so, plans for the weekend?"
36845,Homer,"check it out, flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. guess i can't be your best friend anymore."
30841,Homer,but she'll leave the rest of him alone?
29847,Homer,"hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. we split up, it's all cool, i... i'll kill you!"
33026,Homer,forgot my keys.
36666,Homer,missing?! what kind of a prison are you people running here?
34124,Homer,get to the show!
32726,Homer,"c'mon, pick up, pick up! i know you're there."
29426,Homer,"oh man, i need something to settle my stomach."
37223,Homer,text me the choices.
15426,Homer,it could only be one thing.
15791,Homer,haw haw. april fool's.
25281,Homer,"good news, honey. i found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. i've entered us in a doubles tournament."
16836,Homer,"so, here's to my best friend, ned."
17304,Homer,"oh, i wish i wish i hadn't killed that fish."
25519,Homer,"dear god, what have i done?"
22749,Homer,"well... the last time i saw him, he was in a big plastic bag."
28649,Homer,he was my best friend.
29222,Homer,"screw you, doc! i fly from the gut."
30499,Homer,"no, no, no, it's great. i'm done with it now."
15508,Homer,you're adopted and i don't like you.
29666,Homer,really? then why do you still work here?!
29953,Homer,so if i turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
32246,Homer,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
27706,Homer,nobody loves oily homer...
22036,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll do it. but if i die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
27670,Homer,i guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
27774,Homer,"hey, honey. sorry i'm so late. i had to lay off twenty-seven robots. don't tell me they can't cry."
38127,Homer,guinea pig?
29842,Homer,"hey moe, hey moe-clone."

24717,Homer,"oh, right. why don't we just break into fat tony's compound and get it back?"
34153,Homer,how can you stand up to this punishment?
38774,Homer,"oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"

39435,Homer,"don't correct the man, brat. oh, boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
39870,Homer,"sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months."
29264,Homer,those are good too.

38618,Homer,"because i've never gotten a promotion before. once i thought i had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. so judge me all you want."
29536,Homer,nicely done.
19571,Homer,"no deal, mccutcheon. that moon money is mine!"
30411,Homer,"you know the four seasons? well, i'm experiencing them first hand, because i'm living in the park."
15526,Homer,"oh, yeah."

34465,Homer,"i do, but i'm not going to it."
39184,Homer,"well, i was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
37754,Homer,"for unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in august 2009, a baby."
37443,Homer,did she really say that?

20262,Homer,"hey, what happened to the tunes?"
36026,Homer,"women and shoes, am i right?"
30282,Homer,"does the pizza guy take a check? if so, where do we keep the checks? and lastly, how do you write a check?"
21460,Homer,"at your service, milady."
16348,Homer,"hey, i hear ya, buddy."
27765,Homer,can't i water ski a little bit?
31769,Homer,"i don't know. maybe the krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
34716,Homer,woo hoo! we're region one! we're region one!
24039,Homer,how come bears can crap in the woods and i can't?
30436,Homer,"heyyy, it's bart! super!"

23563,Homer,woo hoo! i'm ten pins away from perfection.
13459,Homer,"bart, it's not like i'm asking you to give blood for free. that would be crazy! you're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. don't you know the story of hercules and the lion?"
23211,Homer,why you little...!
41385,Homer,"you have reached the office of homer simpson. if you are calling about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. if you need--"

21832,Homer,"nothing, nothing. good hustle."
36145,Homer,"really, anyone? what about the hulk riding a rhinoceros? would you stop him from laughing?"
25389,Homer,uh-oh.
40305,Homer,"right, mr. goofball."
35768,Homer,"it's never good. i always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
29624,Homer,"yeah, big surprise. hey marge, here's another bomb: i like beer."
27622,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. i can't be here tomorrow. it's the last day the ribwich is in san francisco."

14487,Homer,marge. come here.
16960,Homer,"i'll miss you, son."
31477,Homer,"son, we all have to do things we don't want to. like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be mr. funny all the time -- you think i wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? like some ancient pagan! just dancing around playing the pan flute! and here we are!"
39491,Homer,"cash, of course. i've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. i'm holding it right now. here it is. look. check it out. two hundred and fifty big ones."
18610,Homer,"i guess some people never change. or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
28585,Homer,"there, there. you're both right."
34589,Homer,"what's it say, boy?"
16765,Homer,stupid bar.

35596,Homer,"okay, stupid flanders, first i want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave homer simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
35634,Homer,you're mean!
21289,Homer,"ooo, still plenty of parking."
32201,Homer,mimi!
22295,Homer,"so, marge, ready for another episode of ""don't go there""?"
23244,Homer,"hey, there was just air in mine."
29794,Homer,sometimes i go to the movies alone.
41064,Homer,bart!
28102,Homer,"but i was chosen by the great spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, i'll be at moe's talking normal."
22044,Homer,even those guys look too civilized for me.
24682,Homer,"well marge, looks like your insane experiment is over."
23147,Homer,"okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
21853,Homer,gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-museum-of-hollywood-jerks.
31316,Homer,"so, it's a war of the worlds. good thing we've got the sun on our side."
28194,Homer,"okay, that's good! stop there!"
29542,Homer,"dammit! well, i'll still do it. you suckers, i would have paid you."
23032,Homer,"you seem to know an awful lot about this for an ""innocent person."""
38873,Homer,"wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!"
17943,Homer,"marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
32458,Homer,"no, i had my stomach stapled!"
27689,Homer,"oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. have some more liquor."
28125,Homer,woo-hoo! pedal to the metal!
13945,Homer,"marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it."
20921,Homer,no. i'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
37867,Homer,the pillow acted as a girdle.
30880,Homer,that's just the product i've been coveting! pick us! pick us!
14759,Homer,"well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. they taste as good as they look. and they come in this delicious red sauce. it looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. but brother it ain't ketchup!"
35708,Homer,sorry!
41550,Homer,"we are sadgasm, and this song is called... ""politically incorrect."""
40332,Homer,you've been rubbing my nose in it since i got here. your family is better than my family. your beer comes from farther away than my beer. you and your son like each other. your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. you make me sick!
30018,Homer,"is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'cause i can make it greener..."
36008,Homer,"...and that's why i really don't believe there's a god. thank you, and god bless america."
40917,Homer,but that was just an idle promise.
32195,Homer,"oh, no! not in spring-time! / summer, winter or fall! no, never could i leave you at all!"
39323,Homer,my wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
34981,Homer,i'll take care of this.

28193,Homer,lisa!
26446,Homer,"well, i thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?"
38108,Homer,"gentlemen, i've been thinking. my glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, i will be old."
20589,Homer,"well, i bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
35627,Homer,"i'm telling you guys, roz told old man burns i ditched work early and now i'm her assistant."
30372,Homer,you're better than that.
40282,Homer,because they might say no.
24582,Homer,intelligent italians? something's wrong.
36654,Homer,on a poker site!
31939,Homer,is that one?
34580,Homer,"sharks, innocent? please. every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. the shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder..."
18024,Homer,"aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. he misses casual sex."
13644,Homer,i'm almost done.
25369,Homer,"ah, it doesn't mean anything. it's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."
29602,Homer,"two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
21507,Homer,people buy grease?
17758,Homer,just a second.
16805,Homer,you know stan taylor?
38008,Homer,"okay, so let's see what we can see!"
23670,Homer,mmm... ovulicious.
36625,Homer,"they just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? how about that? that's trust, huh?"
18666,Homer,it's time to hit him where he lives.
34599,Homer,i'm goin' home. it's not safe in here.
37182,Homer,how many kids will jazz corrupt?
40649,Homer,"nooo, i just want to have a heart-to-heart talk."
23757,Homer,"forget it. he releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: feed the children, save the whales, even release the hounds."
19809,Homer,"y'know, bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
41407,Homer,another me? you can watch the kids.
39336,Homer,"i'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? sort of a spare in case bart's brain blows up."
21716,Homer,but i love my son.
34918,Homer,you don't want a christmas tree? that's crazy! next you won't want a christmas ham.
21558,Homer,"what are you talking about, marge? i don't need a..."

27301,Homer,"marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."

25669,Homer,"he can hear you, rachel."
40348,Homer,"okay, okay, all right, all right. she's right! let's do something together. what does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"

37986,Homer,"okay, let's see what we've got here."
39994,Homer,"well, shake a leg, mama."
26763,Homer,that giggle is none of my business. or is it?
33502,Homer,i have come from my workshop in the north pole to say: don't evict the simpsons!
17710,Homer,"it's true, the bundle is little. but i'm not in it for the money."
16918,Homer,piece of cake. all we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
25100,Homer,"sleep tight, my beloved. you're my ticket out of this hellhole."
28916,Homer,"relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
31611,Homer,and decrepit.

14073,Homer,take that off this second!
28384,Homer,"goodbye, old friend. i'll think of you whenever i have a stroke or a heart attack."
41093,Homer,"absolutely. our third sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. where's some place fun we can take grampa next time?"
31826,Homer,"not naked, i haven't."
31386,Homer,"ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?"
26828,Homer,"happy anniversary, marge!"

13315,Homer,think nothing of it.
27844,Homer,that was a muffin!
33201,Homer,"and these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
32618,Homer,"well, if i'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap i love."
14574,Homer,i am? whoo-hoo!

35002,Homer,"it's not over, marge. it'll never be over. when i shut my eyes, all i see is fat tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
15652,Homer,"oh... it's you. so, you're looking well."
19500,Homer,"we're number one! we're number one! in your face, space coyote!"
36591,Homer,well...
35389,Homer,"now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, i dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe i should open a hair salon."
36862,Homer,he called me... a poser?
33461,Homer,"marge, lighten up. even grampa's enjoying himself."
28648,Homer,they'll be back.
24657,Homer,no problem.
28911,Homer,"i sure am. here you go, son. i brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."
40006,Homer,"ain't that the truth. you know, one time he --"
20402,Homer,then it's settled.
22711,Homer,"great. i'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. and then when the paperwork is done, i'll make gwenn my wife."
36913,Homer,"oh yeah, baby, i'm drinking you down to your knees."
27349,Homer,watch and learn.
13319,Homer,"and is this martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
39503,Homer,arrrgh!
21302,Homer,"okay, boy, i want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. that way i won't be embarrassed if i fail."
40914,Homer,"i'll tell you one thing, greasy joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me."
26049,Homer,"oh, these fortunes are terrible."
27515,Homer,it wouldn't be the first time.
33191,Homer,i'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!
31198,Homer,lady. man. lady. man. lady.
15818,Homer,"thanks for coming to visit me, moe."
17007,Homer,"well, i'm opposed to the whole thing! damn opposed!"
36988,Homer,it's okay. i know what i am.
27790,Homer,"lisa, what's bumming you out? they cancel a test or something?"
39767,Homer,"ahhh... ahhh... oh, how was bowling?"
34197,Homer,"uh-oh, here comes a train."
29769,Homer,"oh yeah, marge? what about my womanly needs?"
26291,Homer,that's what i told lisa!
16842,Homer,"marge! i think i hate ted koppel. no wait, i find him informative and witty. 'nite."
30206,Homer,"hey! i'm bart simpson's father, and i'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! hey, what's that smell?"
34378,Homer,look at that.
24136,Homer,please help me! i'll do anything! i'll light a candle! i'll help with your next charity scam!
16053,Homer,that dog has somebody's ham! this i gotta see!
23368,Homer,and i'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
28261,Homer,"yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. but i'm not gonna leave you."
26442,Homer,"oh, listen to you. ""ooh, ooh, i'm too old to change. "" how old are you?"
18636,Homer,"thank you, neighbors, thank you! now let's give it up for table five! ah-ah-ah-ah / table five, table five... ah-ah-ah-ah / table fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
23494,Homer,"oh, you're right. this farm's hopeless. why didn't i listen to those inbred hicks? i guess i'll just go hang myself in the barn."
30884,Homer,"oh marge, you're the greatest mom ever. i want the whole world to see that."
35861,Homer,"oh, they found it. but don't tell him. this is way cheaper than a nursing home."
17383,Homer,"wait a minute. wait a minute. where's my gummy de milo? okay, don't panic. she can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
30454,Homer,i call the red one!
39134,Homer,"well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
21534,Homer,"emus? really? oh, that's pretty crazy... nah... i'd only fail just like i fail at everything."
33834,Homer,when do i get to move back home?
36338,Homer,at last! this episode promises to finally answer one question!
26689,Homer,"did you say ""life story""?"
29827,Homer,how do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
35971,Homer,dammit! why do kids have heads?
35487,Homer,"flanders, hold up!"
23892,Homer,boo?
32410,Homer,where is it?
35238,Homer,let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. we've got something more important to attend to.
38939,Homer,"no, but we're having fun trying. wait, i mean three."
28453,Homer,ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? theaters... airplanes... why even here. look!
40366,Homer,"come on, give it a name."
21836,Homer,but where will i bask?
16251,Homer,"marge, this may be hard to believe, but i'm trapped inside two vending machines."
19159,Homer,"""project arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. this will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. it's not the dallas cowboys, but it's a start. drop me a line if you're on the east coast, hank scorpio."""
26190,Homer,...which is society's fault because...
39857,Homer,i told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--
29156,Homer,"oh, what's the use? even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate america. i don't want to end up like elmo, hanging himself in prison."
28073,Homer,here's a dollar.
17311,Homer,nothing. nothing at all. let's just eat.
26324,Homer,"well, okay. for you i'll be as dull as dilbert."
27293,Homer,moe! he's got a dark side i've never dreamed of.
37035,Homer,i'm king of the bus station!
35474,Homer,"ned, let's cut to the chase."
23903,Homer,wha...?!
37198,Homer,we're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! and dead people.
18192,Homer,"who? lady, you got the wrong file."
22499,Homer,"goood dog! good doggie! ""tax hike approved""? bad dog. bad, bad dog."
13582,Homer,"boy, when i get home, i'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
35184,Homer,that's what i was gonna call it!
18524,Homer,i don't know.
30763,Homer,i bet this looks cool from overhead though.
31936,Homer,"what are you, a travel agent? 'cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
35860,Homer,"he froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
23419,Homer,"no tommy tune, eh? oh, that's it. you insulted my honor."
23770,Homer,i like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
34376,Homer,"well, don't worry, boy. i know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
40532,Homer,"wow. what great kids. this is the golden age, marge. and the parents of springfield owe it all to you."
33944,Homer,what happened is you left! who did you leave me for? tell me. i can take it.
18839,Homer,"i know! i know! it's selma, right?"
16936,Homer,"hey, this isn't such a great prize. oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
31523,Homer,"marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. that's why you have three kids."
39440,Homer,bart!
17783,Homer,that's it! you people have stood in my way long enough. i'm going to clown college!
22277,Homer,"oh, it's a great team, kent... never gave up hope... i want to thank jesus... and say hi to my special lady marge... we did it, baby! wooooo! woooooo!"
38606,Homer,"thanks, charlie. maybe fracking isn't so bad."
18323,Homer,"man, this place looks expensive. i feel like i'm wasting a fortune just standing here. better make the most of it."
14761,Homer,"whenever marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, i take a walk. i go to a bar, i down a few, and i stumble home in the mood for love."
30737,Homer,"yeah, i'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
28890,Homer,"no wonder they call it ""the good book."""
29870,Homer,how did it ever come to this? i'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. i don't have a friend in the world.
26038,Homer,"a cougar! die, cougar!"
37122,Homer,"if you're lucky, me, then this."
40500,Homer,"you think you've got guts, try raising my kids."
15152,Homer,ice cream truck!
26619,Homer,"hm, fascinating. say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?"
28938,Homer,unkink the hose!
17969,Homer,i have every right to be on that jury even though i got there because i'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
19232,Homer,pho-ny kid-napping...
34997,Homer,ayyyy.
17456,Homer,no.
13358,Homer,"no, i didn't... i... oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
41089,Homer,"dad, the next time we see you we'll do something more fun."
30050,Homer,"sure did. i'd do anything for you, honey. especially if it's easy."
16771,Homer,woo hoo! sold!
35995,Homer,you never showed it to me.
32033,Homer,smile. look cheerful. here we go...
22869,Homer,"mmmm, split-pea."
34079,Homer,a female that gives birth to alcohol.
20635,Homer,register 9 is now closed.
29970,Homer,"son, i just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. leave your body. make lots of friends!"
13473,Homer,"marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
31412,Homer,"yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. change a hundred?"
34739,Homer,yes... uh... maybe i'll just come back during someone else's shift... is claire working today? she's a real sucker.
30284,Homer,it was hard enough gettin' you in there. i'm not lettin' you out.
22261,Homer,ah!! cover your eyes!
41368,Homer,don't eat it. it's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. don't eat it.
20662,Homer,"lisa, no! your hands are too weak!"
22661,Homer,"oh, my."
40603,Homer,no.
23763,Homer,writhing funzos / in my sack / makes me happy / makes me hurt my back...
15646,Homer,liar!
13750,Homer,"hey, this is the only paper in america that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
31704,Homer,"marge, you're my real dream come true. and i get to live you every day."
15196,Homer,wha-do i do...
37482,Homer,"give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
36441,Homer,i'm your jesus! me!
27820,Homer,looks like you're missing a wife.
23520,Homer,"there, there. we had quite a scare today. but you're gonna make us millions. yes you are."
15001,Homer,"hello, work? this is homer simpson. i won't be coming in tomorrow -- religious holiday... the uh, feast of... maximum occupancy."
21299,Homer,"oh, marge. how could you let me let myself go like this?"
36400,Homer,"honey, i'm off to work!"
28418,Homer,"okay, it's probably the tag. but just to be sure..."
28209,Homer,"""peace talks break down."" no. ""for sale, ford festiva..."" i'll put that in the ""maybes."" i gotta get that t-shirt."
20279,Homer,"this mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. but not any more, baby!"
39734,Homer,huh? whuh?
37710,Homer,that doesn't sound happy.
38193,Homer,that proves the painting is mine! and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
40954,Homer,bart!
14454,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. nummy, nummy num."
39532,Homer,"so the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded..."
27678,Homer,yeah. and to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
20496,Homer,"oh, that yodel was so good. i wish i was eatin' it right now."
32738,Homer,that's right. now i'll cut and you soak.
30600,Homer,"charge! i mean, yes sir?!"
36273,Homer,that could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
21508,Homer,"used grease is worth money? then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. i'm rich, apu! rich, i--!"
33285,Homer,what about the bridge?
31738,Homer,stupid selma and grampa... how dare they find happiness?
34324,Homer,"yeah, right."
26496,Homer,"here we are: branson, missouri!"
26825,Homer,"guys, i just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond."
18623,Homer,"but, marge, it works on any ayatollah! ayatollah nakhbadeh, ayatollah zahedi... even as we speak, ayatollah razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
34063,Homer,"okay, okay, you win!"
15573,Homer,sure... unless another aunt dies.
33206,Homer,you what?
23115,Homer,we didn't? that's odd. seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
38981,Homer,what do we do next? what do we do next?
25113,Homer,hmmmm.
41094,Homer,no.
35572,Homer,"later, losers."
15299,Homer,"dear lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is klondike 5-3226."
13711,Homer,"knock 'em dead, boy! kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
41142,Homer,"well, am i?"
26170,Homer,a grizzly bear with a chainsaw. now there's a killing machine!
17066,Homer,"no, wait! uh, uh, wait!... i, yes! i do have a story about two other young marrieds."
24870,Homer,bring me two of every animal.
21353,Homer,just a few feet more...
34695,Homer,uh-oh. what kind of ventilating is that?
40367,Homer,"do you wanna try a little harder, son? come on, give it a girl's name."
31950,Homer,burns stiffed us!
31190,Homer,"okay pretty boy, where's fat tony's fifty bucks?"
21682,Homer,"all right, young lady. i want you to march yourself directly to the kwik-e-mart and get me some chips and a beer."
16196,Homer,all right. stay calm. remember your training.
26348,Homer,"hm, a million dollars? wait a minute. how much sex would be involved? 'cause if it's ""some""..."
38281,Homer,"marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. don't hide behind a magazine."
41374,Homer,especially this time...
18922,Homer,"open your eyes, lisa. our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like bart have lost the will to learn."
33935,Homer,you. you watch.
34143,Homer,"i'll show grampa. i'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories i can share with the world."
37081,Homer,"wow. i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family, but now i see there's another."
35752,Homer,"oh, that is so untroll-y!"
25147,Homer,"well, what gets you through the day?"
33779,Homer,enough to build a washington monument.
32055,Homer,"i've never been to war, but i imagine it feels just like your first kill. the happiness swept me away!"
25224,Homer,...and i never saw gallagher again.
22060,Homer,"well, yeah, i know..."
35586,Homer,ow!
28198,Homer,"bart, you're not at school. don't swear!"
28276,Homer,i win!
22873,Homer,what the?! who the?! hey!
37424,Homer,"okay guys, here's the deal -- i've gone bald."
37436,Homer,well?
26273,Homer,cool. should i take off my shoes?
21958,Homer,uh-oh.
21426,Homer,"yeah, him. whatever happened to that guy?"
23673,Homer,"ooh, look at that. ooh, gingerbread house. hansel and gretel are set for life."
27398,Homer,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. yes."
28698,Homer,"flanders, pull over! i'm an ambulance!"
22673,Homer,"whoa, look at that car burn! does it get any better than this?"
40075,Homer,i deserve this!
37783,Homer,it's true. even the other guy in the elevator. he's right here.
19499,Homer,"hey... we do! oh, marge!"
15373,Homer,"he became francine back in '76. then he joined that cult. i think his name is mother shabubu, now."
30797,Homer,now you're telling me burns's story?
40409,Homer,"halftime, marge, halftime."
34774,Homer,fine. i'm going for a walk.
33574,Homer,"please, can i get it, marge? please? please?"
24115,Homer,"eh, how're they gonna find me?"
35446,Homer,"bart, take the controls!"
14737,Homer,sure they will.
16811,Homer,"watch this, ned. they don't call me springfield fats just because i'm morbidly obese."
13778,Homer,what? what is it? what are you doing?
31869,Homer,no more lazy saturdays for you.
19059,Homer,no more questions. i work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do i -- what?
16294,Homer,really?
28106,Homer,"oh, it's too tight! take it off! take it off! take it off!"
29365,Homer,i broke some bathroom fixtures.
21816,Homer,imagine films.
24308,Homer,"can i, marge? can i?"
24306,Homer,okay...
21863,Homer,"but with college behind us, we'll need careers. and good ones."
37099,Homer,it helps me write.
20935,Homer,"that's my girl. you just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. moe will take care of everything."
38616,Homer,high-quality methamphetamines.
13993,Homer,"you don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
29294,Homer,"oh, i love to see my man eat."
21437,Homer,all right. how's that?
39604,Homer,i'd like to see your finest rv. do you have something that's better than the land behemoth?
40644,Homer,"marge, why did you let me sleep so late?"
27278,Homer,"well then, you might as well stay with us. we serve the same meat the prisons do!"
14758,Homer,"oooh, appetizers."
14536,Homer,don't tell me how to eat donuts --
37826,Homer,what your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
30566,Homer,"hey! nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! whoops, wrong one."
22395,Homer,yup. right down to the scarf.
41079,Homer,we never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
13401,Homer,good! give up!
27759,Homer,"that is so cool. bart, open the door."
39221,Homer,"it's too bright. that flanders, what a big show-off."
18197,Homer,"shut up, judge!"
32368,Homer,that can be arranged.
24817,Homer,"excuse me, sir."
37878,Homer,stop talking! i haven't seen it yet!
30808,Homer,"well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!"
13607,Homer,then i heard the sound that all arctic explorers dread: the pitiless bark of the sea lion. he'll be killed!
25655,Homer,thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
39959,Homer,i read you loud and clear.
23140,Homer,"she's always doing that, mel."
17723,Homer,check.
32782,Homer,"yeah, that's what i mean."
34741,Homer,"it's not what you think... i came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um..."
36535,Homer,i thought there was no crime in new york any more. giulianiii!
28281,Homer,why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
13878,Homer,uh-oh.
40164,Homer,"oooh, a feast."
40016,Homer,sure i do. i just want to have a beer while i'm caring. marge...
39042,Homer,"wow, you're good at that."
32230,Homer,"uh, i'm not sure she's workin' out."
28354,Homer,"please, your majesty, i know that i, like many other americans, have behaved like a total buffoon."
14788,Homer,it doesn't matter.
33418,Homer,i guess that would be nice.
35396,Homer,oh?!
13947,Homer,mmm... salty.
32706,Homer,it's too much work. why don't you come and get me?
39936,Homer,i'm home everybody.
23173,Homer,hel-lo.
13645,Homer,i'll be there. not-y not-y not.
26005,Homer,"ah, whatever. just give me a duff."
30155,Homer,"yep, and nobody's tellin' him. not even his good buddy god."
34471,Homer,"the war is over and the future won. the past never had a chance, man!"
18035,Homer,"uh, i'm sorry, mr. burns, but you can't have these dogs. am i fired?"
21885,Homer,"oh, my god! my middle name is right behind that shrub. i'll finally know what ""j"" stands for! from this moment forth, i will be known as homer...jay simpson. it's so beautiful. what a magical gift for my mother to leave me."
36304,Homer,closer than you think!
25506,Homer,now do you realize how unsafe the american home is? baby accidents occur every three minutes.
31710,Homer,look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
31468,Homer,wow! you made me a sculpture of magilla gorilla.
14494,Homer,"this is the door. he goes through that. this is the roof. and this happy character here is the sun. he shines down on the house, see."
35668,Homer,"that's good, marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
40058,Homer,"good morning, moe's tavern!"
34951,Homer,"chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. i meant to write ""bride."" it's a wedding present."
13166,Homer,"...ooh, what a view..."
25286,Homer,now that's the kinda nagging i can live with.
16475,Homer,"yeah. uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. heh heh."
36113,Homer,you let this monster into our home! where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
40958,Homer,"excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
30769,Homer,"uh, normal wear and tear."
33719,Homer,water!
33669,Homer,"marge, you're not naggy. you just set the bar impossibly high."
25059,Homer,"my car, your roof. it's only fair."
25685,Homer,i am. i'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
35089,Homer,i'll just use my eye.
16902,Homer,"well, that was under our old price structure. under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
38393,Homer,"ah, young love."
15274,Homer,right here.
40091,Homer,"can do, sir."
14681,Homer,"oh, no. i went to this bar the other night, and they..."
19074,Homer,"i guess you mean president clinton. he usually hangs around washington, d.c."
39136,Homer,"marge, which can makes me look cooler? the drizzler or mr. drip?"
33072,Homer,"that's it, boy! you're going to bed without supper!"
22321,Homer,stem lube. even i didn't fall for that... although winter is coming...
26798,Homer,it was magic. he took a cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
18487,Homer,thanks.
38038,Homer,yeah. and?
39284,Homer,who's tiny tim?
31984,Homer,how come things that happen to stupid people keep happening to me?
23002,Homer,are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
14817,Homer,go to hell.
25518,Homer,you can dance / you can dance / everybody look at your pants.
16665,Homer,one hot dog please.
28127,Homer,noooooooooo!
27684,Homer,that's right. over the homes of poor people.
27087,Homer,"no, i think it's seltzer."
36287,Homer,i'm doomed! can they climb stairs?
39819,Homer,"motel, i guess."
34606,Homer,"oh no! i don't have to listen to you. if i'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
32083,Homer,he is not my boyfriend!
24775,Homer,i'm just trying to work up the courage to ask burns for a raise. or a highly-paid internship. something to solve my money woes.
39250,Homer,"and what would you like, little boy?"
37113,Homer,"instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living."
39413,Homer,"me in charge of safety? this place could blow sky-high. nah. i'll concentrate on my work now. gee, this guy's desk sure is big. i can't let marge support the family. this guy's got the cleanest shirt i've ever seen. what should i..."
21814,Homer,kent brockman. please.
15954,Homer,goodbye...
34598,Homer,all right! all right!
32485,Homer,no...
32105,Homer,high? high like a private plane? the kind i'll never be invited to ride on again.
14978,Homer,"hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every sunday? i mean, isn't god everywhere?"
40836,Homer,cable. it's more wonderful than i dared hope.
22045,Homer,i could live at sea! the sea forgives all. not like those mean old mountains. i hate them so much.
27985,Homer,my wads! i never even broke the wrapper.
26718,Homer,why that little...
19107,Homer,okay...
27308,Homer,oh my god! attention drunken idiots: this is your king! sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
15091,Homer,my baloney has a first name / is h-o-m-e-r / my baloney has a second name / it's h-o-m-e-r.
40976,Homer,"because... ... i'm your baby brother, homer!"
22538,Homer,roses. so many roses.
14203,Homer,"phew, good."
29863,Homer,i'm sorry. i'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
24737,Homer,have a good time at your hippie club.
40066,Homer,"oh marge, every woman i i­n­t­e­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me."
25514,Homer,"yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round buddha."
17868,Homer,wrong!
23644,Homer,and these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
37828,Homer,"get real, ding dong! you've already done so much bad stuff, skinner's never going to let you on that boat."
16118,Homer,"no problem, guys. the important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
17537,Homer,and i don't believe in it. it breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. you don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
25220,Homer,"wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals..."
29098,Homer,"she sure did. now if lisa is finished with her shenanigans, i'll tell you why i didn't show up..."
23866,Homer,easy... easy...
24242,Homer,you're going to die in a skydiving accident.
18863,Homer,"oh, that'd be great! sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... it'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
18308,Homer,you are?
28044,Homer,it sure has. you see this bulge back here?
38745,Homer,we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. we are now a cover band. and we shall be called... covercraft. because we play covers and this is our craft.
18971,Homer,why do you need new bands? everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. it's a scientific fact.
31038,Homer,she doesn't recognize us!
38110,Homer,"wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
24856,Homer,hey!
26522,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
22228,Homer,"okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. okay, you're saying that ned and me married you two?"
29064,Homer,"no, i'm not. and here's a picture that proves it."
39796,Homer,where am i... the planet cornball?
19884,Homer,"what, dear?"
17099,Homer,"marge, i figured out what i can give you that no one else can."
23161,Homer,...with a vengeance!
19357,Homer,i won't.
26298,Homer,"that's it, we're outta here."
27748,Homer,hello!
36719,Homer,my dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. and now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. so this should work!
28120,Homer,"boy, that's a big staff. and still he wasn't that funny."
20391,Homer,"oh-ho, confused, would we?"
28508,Homer,"oh, this is sadder than ""tuesdays with morrie."""
16545,Homer,"well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! and remember when i let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like santa claus?"
13615,Homer,ooh... and miss? just one more question --
20540,Homer,woo hoo!
37731,Homer,oh. it was all just a dream.
26084,Homer,just a little more.
20517,Homer,and here i am using my own lungs like a sucker! and how come everyone gets a bedpan and i have to walk all the way over there?
29476,Homer,"thanks, honey. my mind is completely at ease."
24112,Homer,"well, why didn't you say so?"
20932,Homer,huh?
39451,Homer,wahhhhhhhhh!
24214,Homer,"all right, guys. one, two, three."
37442,Homer,what the hell is that?
23266,Homer,"i'll eat eggplant / i could even eat a baby deer... la la la la la la la la la la... who's that baby deer on the lawn, there..."
14332,Homer,a little beer will put out that fire.
14488,Homer,can you believe it? pretty soon i'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
20831,Homer,now i can show all of you what i've come to realize. the reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! he's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
32493,Homer,sometimes i think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
31692,Homer,that's the pool chemicals talking.
35413,Homer,i'm afraid it's all too true. my wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
35844,Homer,christmas card photos?!!
32223,Homer,"marge, when i'm onstage i can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. so in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
28015,Homer,"chaka khan, let me rock you / let me rock you, chaka khan / chaka khan chaka khan..."
21585,Homer,"well, i remember where edison worked. it was menlo park. that's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and..."
31864,Homer,those places are pretty terrible.
41192,Homer,"hey, what do you mean by, ""suggested donation""?"
26363,Homer,"oh god, you're right. i've gotta get her back before it's too late."
36084,Homer,"let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep."
27134,Homer,"there's no need for apologies, guys. you're rock stars! you're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
35736,Homer,"wait, you're gonna be all the guys? how would that work?"
41570,Homer,i need it...
35218,Homer,oh. what's it made of? hash? shrooms? lysergic acid diethylamide?
18858,Homer,great! ya wanna get some lunch?
23006,Homer,"okay, i think he's gone."
36289,Homer,robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause i led them here...
37403,Homer,now wait a minute. gotta make sure you're okay. who's the president now?
19312,Homer,you can't keep blaming yourself. just blame yourself once and move on.
23940,Homer,woo hoo!
38647,Homer,"all set. when he starts gnawing at you, i'll whack him with this broom."
31707,Homer,"look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. but the school's paying for five sessions and there's a chinese restaurant next door where i can get drunk."
37521,Homer,"yeah, just like we did with bart. anyway, this year i'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."
33431,Homer,oh no! now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
17829,Homer,krusty! oh thanks! thanks a lot! you came here to save me!
23993,Homer,"marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. but don't worry, i have a way for duncan to earn his keep."
40105,Homer,boy must die.
41004,Homer,america.
29238,Homer,turn that down!
34026,Homer,yeah!
17711,Homer,"this is getting very abstract, but thank you. i do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
41038,Homer,ooo.
13522,Homer,"wait a minute. if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
38102,Homer,"you just wanna see your old man trip and fall! well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
25849,Homer,"well, i am missing the back of my head. i think you could cut me some slack."
20007,Homer,"so how's it going, grimy?"
22832,Homer,this lady says i'm an artist.
35585,Homer,it's alive?!
24247,Homer,"i'm sorry about your face, moe."
14276,Homer,"marge! marge, where's the baby?"
35872,Homer,high school yearbooks...
32742,Homer,have you ever wondered what i do in that locked room?
31167,Homer,i didn't want you to learn that word this way.
39101,Homer,"guys, i'm comin' back in. suck in your guts."
21086,Homer,ask your mother.
18258,Homer,"wow, barney! you brought a whole beer keg."
27963,Homer,"don't be scared, you can do it!"
16355,Homer,"oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
37486,Homer,"guys, do you think carl was right? what if we're not real friends? maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff..."
14362,Homer,"uh-oh. you see, lisa, daddy's friend moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the dolphins won the game."
29687,Homer,"wow, it makes the lincoln memorial look like crap."
31591,Homer,ah! nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
37000,Homer,"boy, get in the car. and say goodbye to your best friend forever."
28977,Homer,here's your future!
20494,Homer,"wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that marge is your wife."
38895,Homer,"well, it is a great party."
14725,Homer,"i don't have time to answer all these questions. uh, time is money. come on, people!"
40175,Homer,sir --
17900,Homer,no! don't tell marge! i'll be good. i'll be good!
17333,Homer,"sports, sports, sports, sports. sports, sports, sports, sports. marge, bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports."
25449,Homer,don't support a team run by liars!
27329,Homer,disney world?
14400,Homer,"look, what's the problem? the kids are happy, you smell like meryl streep, and i've got that foot massager i've always wanted."
26646,Homer,hardly working...
41227,Homer,i want some peanuts.
41387,Homer,"pistols at dawn?! oh, why did i have to slap a guy who says ""suh""?"
17272,Homer,noooo!
24916,Homer,"so, who brought us here?"
19666,Homer,and one who will work for minimum wage--
15188,Homer,"boy, that'd be sweet."
29122,Homer,"bart, pass the ketchup. bart, pass the ketchup!"
30881,Homer,are you kidding? take a look at my dvd.
40031,Homer,hmmmm
41242,Homer,wait a minute. is he coming on to me?
22225,Homer,"well, of course a-- who are you?"
39924,Homer,"mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... new flavor! triple chocolate!"
32279,Homer,really? what's your handicap?
24836,Homer,that does it. i'm getting a computer! as soon as somebody lets me outta here!
15221,Homer,you can't take our donuts!
17543,Homer,"all right, lisa, you got your way. your mom's going to a psychiatrist. she's gonna tell marge to leave me. it'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
21988,Homer,"oh, man, that's good. pass the butter."
33407,Homer,"honey, i'm home! where are the kids?"
30130,Homer,"yeah, i'll definitely read those later."

16365,Homer,"ow, pointy. eww, slimy. uh-oh, moving. ah-ha!"
40452,Homer,"i have an announcement to make. as a family growth thing, bart and i think we should all go to the monster truck rally this saturday."

14116,Homer,"so uh, how much did it go up?"
25368,Homer,yvan eht nioj. ya gotta love that crazy chorus.
37533,Homer,currently: zero.
26097,Homer,"i was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of chad sexington. do you mind?"
24627,Homer,"mayor, eh?"
13967,Homer,"if stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
28752,Homer,"either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks spanish."
27700,Homer,"suicide, eh?"
28868,Homer,"in a minute, honey."
35231,Homer,can we at least get some french fries?
28252,Homer,bo-ring.
38779,Homer,let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.
15446,Homer,no! remember your hippopotamus oath.
16096,Homer,"c'mon guys, look at yourselves. all you do is study. i'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
39106,Homer,"i've never written an eulogy before, but this time i did. unfortunately, i left it at home."
30894,Homer,"well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either."
30059,Homer,it's everywhere!
18034,Homer,who wouldn't?
39239,Homer,gimme that!
24062,Homer,"those feelings are normal, ned. they're part of the process. watch the sprinkler."
33084,Homer,"y'know, i feel sorry for you, kid. going back to that cold, loveless family."
36489,Homer,what are you talking about? y-you're right!
16986,Homer,"uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
36772,Homer,i'm standing by that.
30469,Homer,"wha? hey, you..."
22213,Homer,"seven, eh?"
25509,Homer,baby could order poison.
37839,Homer,"well, i'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
31727,Homer,he was a great dad! every year he got so mad when santa didn't bring me presents.
16941,Homer,disregard.
38845,Homer,damn technology!
36720,Homer,could you please not sound like you like it so much?
32872,Homer,it's a medical condition!
34586,Homer,i want some of that!
39001,Homer,"i've got him cornered, boy! bag him up!"
37437,Homer,"hair, no hair, i don't really think about it."
21638,Homer,"see? it's just a regular chair, but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your..."
22511,Homer,"but marge, it's worth it. look, the taco bell dog. yo quiero ta... hey, where'd it go? here boy!"
16612,Homer,i didn't say stop.
39341,Homer,"so, how was it?"
31426,Homer,you give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. god bless america!
40011,Homer,"lord help me, i'm just not that bright."
26106,Homer,zing! what's a skeletor?
33922,Homer,but how will i keep from overeating?
33311,Homer,you and me?

24032,Homer,hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-gotta-go!
16314,Homer,"marge, it's the perfect exercise. it'll double the value of our house. and it was free. freeee!!"
33124,Homer,"why flanders, you rogue."
37407,Homer,"okay, moe, one more surprise."

22194,Homer,we're going to break the bank at the monty burns casino!
19655,Homer,"good for you, son. giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. have a dollar."
33760,Homer,look at all these helicopter parents. i hope bart's doing okay on his own.
41311,Homer,"ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
40103,Homer,why you little...

30766,Homer,"wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
33086,Homer,i'll be anything and everything you want! don't leave me here with them!
36329,Homer,what a great opening episode. and i'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
28507,Homer,"there's a trickle-down theory here. if i'm happy, i'm less abusive to the rest of you."
25221,Homer,so many flavors! all those tasty memories flooding back!
17630,Homer,i always wondered if there was a god. and now i know. there is. and it's me.
32081,Homer,uh-huh. see you at five then.
26035,Homer,"all right turkey. where are you? turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
32912,Homer,i've gotta get out of here!
19559,Homer,"uh, i'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. any questions at all. doctor hibbert?"
27550,Homer,"that's right. you're mine till you're eighteen. and when you're seventeen i'm gonna know the end is near, so i'm gonna work you like a dog."
23786,Homer,quit it! must wash eyes! j--
23317,Homer,people will think what i tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
37028,Homer,lotta people at the dump today.
21738,Homer,ooh!
37260,Homer,"so, you went and hired a law firm, eh? that's pretty aggressive."

29355,Homer,look at all that cash.
20251,Homer,"it's green, moron. earth to stupid guy, hullo? maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass."
17595,Homer,i'll take this communist one too.
35607,Homer,so your dad has money to lend?
26839,Homer,"well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
14119,Homer,not any more...
36757,Homer,"get him! i mean, woo hoo!"
21552,Homer,"bart, please. the groundskeeper and i are trying to settle this like adults."
40857,Homer,"well, run for the hills, ma barker, before i call the feds."
38448,Homer,okay. let's make some fireworks.
29574,Homer,"son, your mother makes a very loud point..."
39672,Homer,wah-neh! wah-neh!
34432,Homer,"the dome of the rock? messiah, away!"
19667,Homer,did you say mary pop--
34020,Homer,she couldn't possibly do worse!
22708,Homer,"sure thing, gwenn."
18799,Homer,"hi, mr. burns. do you want your coffee now?"
27640,Homer,"flanders, i mix twinkies and ding dongs all the time. in europe they call it a dinkie."

32933,Homer,the rainforest?! that's that thing lisa likes!
29024,Homer,but i've gotta do something! i'll need a disguise.
30438,Homer,those were my good pants.
15364,Homer,why you little...
29993,Homer,you're a selfish jerk.
20054,Homer,call me when you get a karaoke machine.
20475,Homer,"yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?"
15510,Homer,"but don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you."
19382,Homer,"well, call us if you need anything."
32988,Homer,just warming it up. now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
35059,Homer,"i liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. but the supervising producing was the best i've ever seen."
37713,Homer,let's do it.
33481,Homer,no problem. just let sir fix-a-lot slay this chore.
33270,Homer,"homer, why are you really here?"
35883,Homer,airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
30845,Homer,"oh, you're so right. i guess i should be more concerned with bart's safety than covering my own butt. and maybe i'm talking like this because i can't stop. help me, lisa! i have serious mental problems!"
28572,Homer,"""families come first"" is supported by lifelong springfieldians you know and trust like me, milhouse's dad, bumblebee man, surly duff, and that jerk that goes ""yeees!"""
32751,Homer,flanders! you ate my jerky!
31901,Homer,lousy reverend. he's having my sex! while i'm at home with marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
39867,Homer,"oh, hello principal skinner. i'd get up but the boy crippled me."
33624,Homer,"marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. so -- will you marry me -- in style?"
22126,Homer,shake on it?
27374,Homer,how did you know?
37842,Homer,the deed is done.
40950,Homer,"oh dad, you and your imagination."
24268,Homer,then what is his ghost protecting?
29660,Homer,"hey, why'd you lock the door? we're still inside!"
13569,Homer,what's that?
32160,Homer,vanderbilt?
36461,Homer,welcome to marriage! another good man bites the dust.
16672,Homer,what? that's your job. if he starts doing lisa's wood chopping...
40569,Homer,five hundred thousand dollars. i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
25960,Homer,clear!
41306,Homer,just for that i'm not going to help you.
23207,Homer,some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
31353,Homer,"moe, moe, you gotta hide us from the army!"
17441,Homer,enchiladas.
18408,Homer,yyy... y... y... y...
34400,Homer,"boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
21925,Homer,"aww, you're just saying that."
37578,Homer,"i'll just enjoy these green beans with slivered almonds. mmm, so slivered."
26328,Homer,"professor van doren, so good to see you."
37139,Homer,i had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
40079,Homer,do any of these suits do that?
22081,Homer,are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? it's full of nerds.
26057,Homer,ummm...
28224,Homer,"mom? you're back. just like you were back before, then you left me again. i love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. oh, what the heck."
37946,Homer,"c'mon, buddy. i gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
24786,Homer,will you keep giving me money?
34660,Homer,"but my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!"
36996,Homer,there's no handle on this side!
15601,Homer,i can't think with all this noise!
25677,Homer,now for the awkward part. we gotta talk about money.
34074,Homer,why do my actions have consequences?
34979,Homer,well... back in my keister you go.
34612,Homer,you can help me take out those cameras.
39193,Homer,"i don't get it. football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. why can't i just remember which cards have been played?"
24499,Homer,mamma mia!
15933,Homer,woo!
30498,Homer,"oh, it's heartfelt. there's no escaping that. thanks, honey."
30632,Homer,"yeah, i tell marge everything! not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such."
36353,Homer,"again with ""mr. steak!"" do you know why i go to mr. steak? because at mr. steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at mr. steak!"
14244,Homer,"i swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
29668,Homer,"mmm, hot dog."
18454,Homer,"oh, mom. i'm sorry i never come to see you. i'm just not a cemetery person."
17346,Homer,"okay, hon."
16389,Homer,"hey, there's a new mexico."
15452,Homer,could you dumb it down a shade?
18136,Homer,"that's okay, son. i'll take care of him."
40130,Homer,"there you are, my man. and a dollar for yourself."
33471,Homer,"listen, you! when you gave me that money, you said i wouldn't have to repay it till the future! this isn't the future! it's the lousy, stinking now!"
14845,Homer,they're singing again. lousy neighbors. wish i was deaf.
40377,Homer,"flanders, i don't care what this looks like, bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."
25813,Homer,so much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
15114,Homer,"barney! not you, too!"
38783,Homer,"i'll be right home, honey. i've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening."
17377,Homer,oooh -- gummy bears. gummy calves heads. gummy jaw breakers.
38254,Homer,"that's all right, brain. if i die, i'll be doing the thing i love the most: trying not to get killed."
41254,Homer,"mental note: ""the girl knows too much."""
21591,Homer,"from this day forward, i am an inventor!"
28305,Homer,we've gone on plenty of great vacations.
31365,Homer,"thinking it over, huh? i'm cool with that."
13983,Homer,"oh great, you made me miss joe theisman."
31076,Homer,boo.
21384,Homer,lisa?! lisa?! li-sa?!
22985,Homer,take that!
30780,Homer,huh?
15562,Homer,patty. selma. i'm sorry.
31666,Homer,bart! this is a matter of life and death: what is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
33602,Homer,"well, we need help. someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
21170,Homer,marge! the kids are on!
28449,Homer,"but from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!"
22984,Homer,judges can't win the contest! booooo!
24491,Homer,"then we figured out we could park them in front of the tv. that's how i was raised, and i turned out tv."
25921,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to be tried separately."
20130,Homer,frontsies... backsies... i'm with them... v.i.p... coming through... very important person... they gave me frontsies...
18268,Homer,"lisa, you ruined my barbecue. i demand you apologize this second!"
16694,Homer,this isn't very convenient.
16337,Homer,"marge, i'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
39645,Homer,"uh-huh. okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. you girls just stay here and relax."
13578,Homer,"that's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. could i have it in writing, please?"
33923,Homer,found this on the roof.
41324,Homer,"greetings, friend..."
14040,Homer,"great, thanks."
37470,Homer,fifty bucks per bag? i guess i'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
15564,Homer,"legend of the dog-faced woman! oh, that's good."
20027,Homer,"... and our beautiful baby. my daughter, lisa -- i.q. 156."
35854,Homer,"no, i just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
36860,Homer,"oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy."
24708,Homer,"yeah, i'm watching, honey. nice cannonball. anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'cause over-thinking is... what were we talking about? ooh, a clown."
31224,Homer,deal!
40180,Homer,"-- art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -- tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!"
18189,Homer,lousy houseplant!
15391,Homer,ah yes. i remember the day we moved in...
37003,Homer,here's something to pass the endless time. write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
30367,Homer,i forgot to floss this morning!
17570,Homer,like what?
40489,Homer,"you know, marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
24267,Homer,searched for lincoln's gold.
27685,Homer,"so kids, its valentine's day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching tv with the sound turned way up."
13599,Homer,"oh, marge. cartoons don't have any deep meaning. they're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
31654,Homer,"whoa, you just blew my mind!"
36562,Homer,hero away!
29583,Homer,the bad news keeps on coming.
22159,Homer,"aaah, what's the rush? might rain next week."
18369,Homer,"i was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- honey, i'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
14932,Homer,babies.
36960,Homer,butter.
35197,Homer,"bart, cheech and chong were the beavis and butthead of their day!"
20385,Homer,"this gun cost me everything. my wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
23876,Homer,look at moe dance! aloha moe...
30317,Homer,"marge, i'm always amazed you chose me."
16508,Homer,y'ello?
18162,Homer,no. no. no. ewww. why is this on the floor?
13427,Homer,no.
22374,Homer,"wally, i'd be lying if i said i hadn't."
13504,Homer,i don't know.
41373,Homer,she'll forgive me...
35713,Homer,"we're not here for you, we're here for lenny."
29691,Homer,wha?
28214,Homer,"someone, or something, knows i love oversized food and short, punchy articles. so they hid a message in the first letter of each line. see: ""homer, meet me 4th street overpass, midnite."""
38296,Homer,"hello, marjorie."
19101,Homer,heeeeey...
18332,Homer,i'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... i'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... i'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! i don't know...
25375,Homer,"not ""mad""! that's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine."
40640,Homer,be intimate with marge.
15126,Homer,hee hee!
35164,Homer,"you got your wish, boy. i'm proud of ya. i'm sorry i took all the credit."
31628,Homer,you guys liked him?
38867,Homer,wow. this place is completely alien but everything's in english. just like canada.
17046,Homer,"down the hall, room twelve."
23448,Homer,race ya to the swimmin' hole!
36262,Homer,let's go!
25794,Homer,"all right, but your next story better be worth it."
34557,Homer,but that would make a great movie.
13316,Homer,"hey, what's the matter, son?"
14072,Homer,i'll tell you what's wrong. that rotten moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
28685,Homer,why do you keep talking that way?!
14317,Homer,"yeah, that timmy is a real hero."
15074,Homer,will you remember this the next
32820,Homer,"son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--"
31342,Homer,that's an odd way to start handing out medals.
31453,Homer,well excuse me for having enormous flaws that i don't work on!
18216,Homer,old painty-can ned!
35954,Homer,what the?
21122,Homer,walk? that wasn't part of the deal.
36083,Homer,"now, i gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
18013,Homer,"hmm, i guess bart's not to blame. he's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and i've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
41057,Homer,"oh man, two dollars. uh, i'll take these three... they're for my daughter."
24895,Homer,that's a great idea! i'll make up some news!
19148,Homer,well...
31694,Homer,i'll tell you why.
16316,Homer,no it doesn't!
35465,Homer,"okay, time to go back in the... night-night... this is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... i thought we had a deal, man!"
41246,Homer,"this is it, homer. it's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past."
30382,Homer,"now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome mr. krusty the clown!"
20758,Homer,"listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... you better not be in my ass-groove!"
24599,Homer,"oh, if only it were that easy, marge."
30921,Homer,"lisa's right! it is a cool, super sport!"
28230,Homer,"cora, is there a back way outta here?"
16682,Homer,that kwik-e-mart's a real... .
14732,Homer,uh-huh...
21058,Homer,hmm. what would the captain say in my spot?
35781,Homer,i've outgrown you!
25267,Homer,"hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
40678,Homer,"well, i ... oh, let's get some worms."
18221,Homer,forty seconds? but i want it now.
31675,Homer,oops. sorry for the spoiler.
31258,Homer,"look, i understand that you're mad. which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old springfield roller coaster."
37331,Homer,marriage is so tough. every second it could explode catastrophically. makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
40763,Homer,no way.
24563,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i'm not merry."
36194,Homer,i know this dream! it's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!
37616,Homer,"lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where i work poisons our water and our air."
35598,Homer,"hey bart... i mean, jesus. hey son, you want flanders to kill anybody? he's totally in my power."
26861,Homer,are you all right?
32198,Homer,"excuse me, ""film."""
28229,Homer,i made this when i was five. i had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
19843,Homer,"oh, moe, thank god you're here! we'd like to come in and drink, please!"
38300,Homer,"ooh, pepperoni!"
26232,Homer,oh my god! wow. now that's a goiter.
30904,Homer,"yeah, well, i'm gonna vote ""no"" on thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
32249,Homer,spilled milk?!
40661,Homer,"hey, flanders, could i borrow your camcorder?"
37782,Homer,i haven't had a drink for a week.
17276,Homer,must kill family. .
30819,Homer,i'm winning!
31218,Homer,and what about my new job as a mexican wrestler?
19354,Homer,"well, it was like that when i got here. it really was."
34277,Homer,i couldn't hear the last thing you said! goodbye forever!
28814,Homer,all of them.
17822,Homer,benedict arnold!
30377,Homer,so you want maggie to infect your kids?
27047,Homer,"so long, jerks."
19252,Homer,"it's a party, marge. it doesn't have to make sense."
37975,Homer,i'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
29371,Homer,"screw the market, we're going to mexico!"
30699,Homer,"ha-ha! that's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
32416,Homer,"oh, i'll never remember what color marge's eyes are!"
16961,Homer,"son, i know you're upset because you thought you saw us on tv saying we didn't want you in our family. but those were just actors playing us."
21699,Homer,"woo hoo! marge, they found a donor! i'm saved!"
41295,Homer,"just smile, nod... and stall, stall, stall..."
28783,Homer,"that's my baby, jerk."
40190,Homer,"oh... oh, i hate halloween."
24463,Homer,"go, lisa! c'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!"
15051,Homer,"hey, barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?"
23877,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
25251,Homer,"but that's just under nine hundred dollars. i wish i could go seventeen thousand, but..."
39037,Homer,"car, go park at work so people think i'm there."
15103,Homer,don't you remember? he went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
19038,Homer,"""wel-diddly-elcome simpsons."" oh, geez. he actually wrote ""diddly."""
33132,Homer,"i came here once with marge. are you marge, sylvia?"
22614,Homer,i didn't mean to! look!
37650,Homer,"dear, i am not the jealous type. and from you, i have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
31718,Homer,"of course, you idiot, 'cause i'm wishing for more money."
15629,Homer,i'll take him! do you have him in blonde?
28974,Homer,we're alone now.
34081,Homer,lisa! lisa!
35308,Homer,"it's ""a-b-c-1-2-3""! it's the easiest song in the world!"
40155,Homer,"oooo! that was a big mama. heh, heh, heh."
23999,Homer,ma'am.
38910,Homer,"but, wait a minute! that's my job!"
31296,Homer,beer-battered germans...
23232,Homer,"marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
30321,Homer,"flanders, i can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
29394,Homer,"the resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those blu-blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear."
20829,Homer,but i want to go.
21268,Homer,"oh no! wait, i think i've got the perfect solution."
19485,Homer,earl. my new friend's name is earl!
39851,Homer,about a million girls.
21803,Homer,aaand shiitake.
27405,Homer,"oh, marge. you're not gettin' it, it's me. homer. simpson."
13685,Homer,"hey flanders, when are your busy hours?"
15347,Homer,"hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat."
27912,Homer,his wife is dead!
16979,Homer,all right.
15896,Homer,woo hoo! the greatest day of the year.
28509,Homer,"c'mon marge, i'm not the only selfish person. you have to get your hair done at ""supercuts."" i guess regular ""cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
31492,Homer,ow! i can't read ahead -- i promised lisa i wouldn't!
41012,Homer,"oh, okay."
40965,Homer,"well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being i ever..."
22849,Homer,good night.
23262,Homer,"hey, i smell cake! cake that says ""farewell"" and ""best wishes""!"
38256,Homer,"i repeat, no penalty!"
32202,Homer,mimi!
36578,Homer,is there any other deal that you can accept?
39141,Homer,not my department.
27771,Homer,"well, i have to work, but give the monitor a kiss."
41272,Homer,"mmm. look at his eyes. he's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the good las vegas way."
27297,Homer,very well. i am gone!
35524,Homer,but what if the weathergirl--
31937,Homer,i feel kinda responsible. maybe i should volunteer to be a fireman.
14471,Homer,hello... i'd like the department of missing babies.
21634,Homer,"oh, that. i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff."
38507,Homer,"fine. i'll swab whatever you say. look, i'm swabbing the deck. i'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. oh! i'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
39657,Homer,what? oooh! jungle man!
18777,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? the things?"
26648,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, i've got news for you. i just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""yes-i-cannabis."""
36384,Homer,looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
35806,Homer,you're not a client. you're the client.
35545,Homer,he has no friends.
29188,Homer,"i'm so sorry, honey. i said good things about you too. check out the lifestyle section: ""plastic pearls make the girl."""
33071,Homer,huh?
40353,Homer,"i know, i know. i can still make this for five. come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. pleeze."
31732,Homer,"well i never, ever want to see that again."
27370,Homer,"well... if hiring this guy will make lisa like me again, then i'll do it! can i get this beer to go?"
20513,Homer,damn right.
35717,Homer,okay -- maggie gets a toy!
18019,Homer,"don't worry. as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. believe me, i know."
39903,Homer,well?
14326,Homer,"don't worry, you'll grow into it."
41291,Homer,i'm doing the best with what i got! all you feed me is reality shows!
15803,Homer,mmmm... beer.
15747,Homer,yoink.
31954,Homer,well... most of it.
14313,Homer,wait a minute. does this mean you like my present?
20233,Homer,"oh, i'll take it."
31992,Homer,"cheer up, boy. we'll get you their most vicious street cur! he'll bite your ass raw!"
13436,Homer,are you?
40841,Homer,"don't worry, marge. take a look at this."
38399,Homer,"because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four."
33117,Homer,sushi fight!!
16268,Homer,"man's best friend, indeed."
26368,Homer,"oh no. if marge marries artie, i'll never be born!"
17986,Homer,"yo, hugh. here's a little bit of u.s. hospitality. what do you think of that?"
37041,Homer,woo hoo!
18825,Homer,"oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger."
33318,Homer,are you guys dangerous?
32093,Homer,"beer beer, beer beer / beer beer beer beer beer..."
21069,Homer,that's it. left. left. steady as she goes.
24594,Homer,get it.
15501,Homer,"now, marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely..."
19791,Homer,well... but... wait a minute. bart's not fixed yet! he hasn't even --
13999,Homer,"goodbye, son."
40945,Homer,not one word.
33900,Homer,"i don't know how you put up with all these kids, toohey. if i were you there'd be a lot of strangled babies."
30785,Homer,i'm getting blue pants in the morning / ding dong the zipper's gonna shine...
35283,Homer,"hey, doc. where is everybody?"
22338,Homer,"aw, thank god! now we can stop holding it in."
32063,Homer,did you know that every day mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
18741,Homer,"yes, that'd do."
14999,Homer,perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
31659,Homer,"hello, bart?"
25392,Homer,it's what i always tell them. i told them that twice yesterday. and then again as they were going to sleep.
31556,Homer,"blue pinwheel, red pinwheel, big white ball, wait for the ""aaahhh..."""
17722,Homer,we're doomed!
24109,Homer,you're mad? where's my show!?
30146,Homer,"this theater sucks. my seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
25470,Homer,me so hungee.
15948,Homer,"i'm surprised you don't remember, son. it was only eight years ago."
31304,Homer,"what happened to ""for better or for worse?!"""
28346,Homer,"well marge, if i die here, there's one thing i want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in england. they won't work in our vcr!"
35968,Homer,"u.s. of a! great song, ted. when's our next gig? are we goin' to new york, or--"

20339,Homer,yuh.
37936,Homer,you're pirating my movie?
13553,Homer,doesn't ring a bell.
22237,Homer,"are you sure? oh, rats. no offense, sweetie."
27128,Homer,"test, test. check, check."

39808,Homer,"i hear ya, buddy! whew! full moon!"
23348,Homer,"hi, maude. diddily. i've been having fun with my pal homer. diddily."

22841,Homer,"so i'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. c'mon, gimme what you got."
40260,Homer,little baby batter / can't control his bladder!
38905,Homer,"captain's log, star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. after successfully conquering the rigelians..."
34720,Homer,"five hundred dollars? that's, like, ten dead grampas! some of us stuck to our limit, marge. and i would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!"
29878,Homer,next song. / that's what i meant. / absolutely.
30120,Homer,i've gotta save them.
38518,Homer,does this answer your question?
13277,Homer,i do not miss bart at all.
17153,Homer,"ow! ow! oh, they're defending themselves somehow!"
19510,Homer,"hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something i can't quite put my finger on."
25297,Homer,"well, good for you! anyone i know?"
37061,Homer,found another one.
25820,Homer,"well, i... there. right as rain, there."
32358,Homer,you ruined that pie!
34050,Homer,"hey, it's not like i want to go. go, go, go!"
19711,Homer,"so it was pretty okay, huh?"
28871,Homer,"i paid your bail, honey. you're free to go."
38521,Homer,hey! i was listenin' to that!
34757,Homer,...dislocating fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
29869,Homer,i'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
39962,Homer,"one, please."
13426,Homer,no.
25908,Homer,"hey, shut up."
22860,Homer,what's going on here? you weirdos love this stuff.
31782,Homer,"look at those celebrities: i've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence."
36809,Homer,"bart, stop it! you might fall!"
39334,Homer,"nonsense, marge! frosty krusty flakes are what got him where he is today."
32031,Homer,bart!
26188,Homer,"look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. marge, bart, girl-bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. how i loathe him."
24486,Homer,"i heard she mates with men, then eats them."
19288,Homer,"sure, we could tear this house down..."
28045,Homer,now it actually is a fanny pack.
36156,Homer,more angry texts from work!
33844,Homer,"eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! i'm sorry, marge. where are my manners? did you want to taunt my kill also? press the x button."
38631,Homer,"wait, mr. burns! i'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! sometimes i think she and i have nothing in common."

26962,Homer,"oh, i'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now i have to sleep them off."
23240,Homer,"wake up, honey!"
22357,Homer,we can still make the kickoff!
25997,Homer,"freshen your drink, pal?"
23862,Homer,"oh, that's it. you're through, dean!"

22330,Homer,"yeah, they're good. but i wouldn't count out the... denver broncos ."
14085,Homer,"how could you do this to me, moe? this bar was going under and it was the drink i invented that saved it."
31881,Homer,knock it off! he's just a kid!
27838,Homer,marge... did i ruin your life?
22609,Homer,thank god for grave robbers.
14564,Homer,"hey, i called for that!"
17662,Homer,"it all began about two years ago, before maggie was even born. bart, you were lisa's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago."
27203,Homer,"oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling."
31781,Homer,"okay boy, do something annoying. but leave yourself room to build."
15310,Homer,then call klondike 5-3226. call now and receive a free t-shirt.
24187,Homer,a plane! stop! get me off this stinking rock!
25182,Homer,i can't complain.
19299,Homer,"yup, pretty much. except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
24730,Homer,"no, of course not."
35993,Homer,now who's the greatest writer of all time?
40498,Homer,"i love you too, son. you know, boy, i don't think i've ever felt as close to you as i do right --"
18601,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, next week is the big championship game..."

21966,Homer,"c'mon, boy, dig in. they'll give you a big, strong thorax."
35169,Homer,"me! me! i want him every night, and forever and ever! 'cause i love my--"
32052,Homer,what's this?!
34235,Homer,"with that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
27021,Homer,"in the jungle, the creepy jungle / homer rides a freak..."
28158,Homer,never!
13378,Homer,"whoa, who says that?"
29180,Homer,"yo, i'll tell you what i want, what i really really want... what i want what i want i'll tell you what i..."

37996,Homer,"look, honey, i know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. isn't that right, glasses?"
23591,Homer,but she said i...
16259,Homer,"marge, that's twice. i think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
14555,Homer,"i did! whoo-hoo! whoo-hoo! in your face, strawberry!"
28027,Homer,i did it. i walked all the way to moe's from my house.
15096,Homer,ew. dog water.
38161,Homer,"so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
41423,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
36749,Homer,"i'm in an abusive relationship with life. it keeps beating the hell out of me, and i'm too cowardly to leave it. maybe i could drink myself to death."
26894,Homer,"lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!"
17732,Homer,i needed more money to support my growing family. and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
25060,Homer,"well, yeah."
13786,Homer,uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
41110,Homer,whoo-hoo. it's dad. dad's on the phone. he's calling me.
33687,Homer,"man oh man, slap a ring on that!"
14321,Homer,"don't worry, son. just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. i brought you your krusty doll..."
40441,Homer,"marge, are we ever gonna see him again?"
21410,Homer,"i'm enjoying my life too much to care. and you should be too. so what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!"
33853,Homer,maybe you could come over again. i'll cook you my special microwave burritos. i stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
32521,Homer,"hey, what smells so good?"
35039,Homer,"ooh, three!"
25074,Homer,"hey, this car's got cruise control."

27813,Homer,hey! these two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!
14215,Homer,what's it say?
35985,Homer,"sir, as a complexion scientist, i must advise you against using any more. this is the most powerful hydrator we sell."
29899,Homer,"oh sorry, son. i wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. hey, ray's here!"
29329,Homer,same one.
33300,Homer,there's one on lisa!

39115,Homer,marge! stop that crazy thing!
37297,Homer,beats drowning.
14826,Homer,"yeah. you know, my life just can't get any worse."
24101,Homer,"so how'd you do tonight, romeo?"
17801,Homer,"uh, can't. i've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
31989,Homer,all right.
24172,Homer,"gather 'round, everyone! i'm going to teach you about religion."
26372,Homer,"i saw something terrible, and i can't even say it so i'll have these two dolls do it for me."
31017,Homer,you seem cool. wanna catch a movie?
32189,Homer,my pleasure. if ever i would leave you / it wouldn't be in summer. / seeing you in summer i never would go...
17141,Homer,sugar man!!
40393,Homer,heh heh... that crazy marmaduke...
34252,Homer,"yes, but i have one more thing to show you."
35999,Homer,"man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
37960,Homer,i get that a lot too.
13534,Homer,"honey, do me a favor. fill out this form."
20679,Homer,go!
28390,Homer,it's a deal!

40692,Homer,"hey, burns! eat my shorts!"
14591,Homer,yeah!
15280,Homer,"well, i got him as good as he got me."
26219,Homer,"marge, you're speaking to me."
25256,Homer,but try tellin' that to killy mcgee up there.
40053,Homer,but it's a thousand bucks... burns would can my butt in no time flat.
15550,Homer,batman?
40419,Homer,"hi, patty. hi, selma."
34846,Homer,run!
14008,Homer,"okay. no, i'm gonna do it."
23028,Homer,"oh yeah. i'm betting on jai-alai in the cayman islands, i invested in something called news corp..."
38327,Homer,"yeah, i can die all i want -- frink's got homers like the tuileries has park benches. huh? wonder where i picked that up."
21553,Homer,that's my grease! it's mine! give it here!
15139,Homer,"dad, you and your stories... ""bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
39214,Homer,"yeah. if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance."
35183,Homer,go ahead.
40425,Homer,this thing's gonna be roaring any time now!
24248,Homer,"yeah, you were..."
30248,Homer,they're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. how am i gonna get rid of marge and the kids?
26195,Homer,"here's how it's gonna go down. as a family, we drive away. we cover for each other -- as a family. it's what gabriel would have wanted."
16084,Homer,"all right, i will."
41149,Homer,bart!
27620,Homer,you monster! why did you expel boogerman?
34605,Homer,who wants feet steak?
34840,Homer,she does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
36347,Homer,spoil-er!
29411,Homer,what a magical party this has been. mr. burns is a great man.
13916,Homer,i've got it all figured out. by day it will roam free around the neighborhood. and at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
23062,Homer,"oh, all right."
24085,Homer,what would you say about a man who owns his own house...
38764,Homer,it's something you make sketches about.
13572,Homer,was the door locked?
33138,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here."
18543,Homer,"i know how you feel, bart. when i was your age, i wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. well, goodnight."
41005,Homer,you do.
33000,Homer,what'd you do that for?
30054,Homer,"oh, i love you, dumpster-bons."
20359,Homer,"what? oh apu, i would never..."
14844,Homer,"all right, we won't get the chair. now excuse me while i kiss the sky."
24197,Homer,"oh, my god."
32372,Homer,"how about a little neck rub, baby?"
32073,Homer,hoo!
24074,Homer,you'll see...
37091,Homer,great. and now my dad can notarize.
37811,Homer,i do.
34790,Homer,"hey pal, how ya been?"
29873,Homer,"mine. oh, move your hand. i get this!"
34965,Homer,"uh, what's my name again?"
39550,Homer,"oh, no! i'm not down, i'm -- get up, you! get up! come on!"
36397,Homer,uh... i got... shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
27517,Homer,can i borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
29653,Homer,show you what it's like in the real world!
19934,Homer,"well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. so you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
24311,Homer,"oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
14801,Homer,"i'd say ""you're a lying scumbag."" why sweetie?"
19746,Homer,"am i, marge? am i? think of the property values! now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
20116,Homer,"hey! i'm not a bum... thanks, but i don't need... okay, if you insist, but... spare change, lady? lousy cheapskate..."
19248,Homer,"it'll be okay, honey. there's lots more oil where that came from."
17996,Homer,"marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. i never realized how much i missed it. listen to the murmurs in the next room. the house is full of life again."
20673,Homer,"oh no, there's that angry mob again."
19052,Homer,"wait, i got it."
15709,Homer,"barney, give me your keys. you're too drunk to drive."
26781,Homer,i saw you and that squishee lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
18594,Homer,gotta go. my damn wiener kids are listening.
27194,Homer,wait for what? confirmation of my attitude?
29225,Homer,"marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
38494,Homer,you did that on purpose! you lick this table clean!
25671,Homer,"yeah, maybe it was too soon."
39986,Homer,more champagne?
21260,Homer,"hey, ray. cleanin' out the old office, eh?"
41188,Homer,the museum!
41469,Homer,you're lookin' at him.
33037,Homer,"thanks, marge."
23905,Homer,everyone gets an award but me.
33794,Homer,all the other parents are doing it for their kids. now stand back and i'll take it from here. a little further back.
17419,Homer,"oh, marge. it's a miracle."
16371,Homer,"well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
13600,Homer,"nah, you go ahead."
29846,Homer,"hey marge, why are you with krusty? these kids are too old for clowns."
40063,Homer,"well, your resume seems in order. besides typing and stuff, do you have any other qualifications i should know about?"
38420,Homer,i see.
27450,Homer,"kids, i'll go find your mother."
30106,Homer,forget school! we have to get to the mesa!
24556,Homer,did you see that? i did the deed! open up!
31065,Homer,"oh no, bart and lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!"
14848,Homer,"herb, let me give you the grand tour. this is one of our many light switches. it functions in both the on and off mode."
40996,Homer,"wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. let me see if i got this straight... it's christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach..."
20209,Homer,"our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. bart was miserable at school, and lisa's gifts were going to waste."
23291,Homer,"there's the coffee mug from ""heartbeeps""!"
31741,Homer,i've got a good feeling about this.
39669,Homer,how would i know. quit asking pointless... bart look!
30684,Homer,"uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
24189,Homer,it could be you!
30204,Homer,bart! what the hell are you saying?
15437,Homer,"marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes."
24000,Homer,now for the actual horse whispering.
39067,Homer,please keep spinning it. i don't wanna look at it.
40650,Homer,"you know, bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --"
14093,Homer,"ah, my new watering hole."
36927,Homer,everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
21161,Homer,do they do any other tricks?
39135,Homer,"you know, moe, you're a real jerk. i didn't mind so much when it came with beer."
13618,Homer,uh-uh.
25407,Homer,"well duh! he's breathtaking, but bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent."
21910,Homer,"hey square, expand your mind! the doors of perception are open for business."
28071,Homer,you mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
18708,Homer,and all those other balls?!
31095,Homer,look at all those people. you know them?
37275,Homer,"flanders, i've come to forgive you."
30057,Homer,"finally, a character i can relate to. i bet good things happen to him."
21483,Homer,"oh, why can't they just play through?"
17359,Homer,"oh, so you're a bart woman, are you?"
27488,Homer,they thought of everything! how come all the good things happen to jesus h. nice? by which i mean flanders!
16305,Homer,oooh! the springfield men's shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
28552,Homer,"and now, i think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! ned?"
37089,Homer,"i swear to you, marge, when i have the time, i will google them both."
19079,Homer,that's one of the creatures!
32614,Homer,"set the table, marge!"
33122,Homer,i'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
15771,Homer,"sorry, mr. burns, but i don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. sure, i'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
16099,Homer,"but marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
26751,Homer,grape.
26697,Homer,"ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
37007,Homer,if jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
39282,Homer,uh-uh.
27282,Homer,"pbs, stephen hawking, the fat little dixie chick..."
37914,Homer,your moans of sympathy are all i have!
27904,Homer,how am i supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... wait a minute...
39543,Homer,the den! great idea!
26416,Homer,cockfight.
29154,Homer,"great, dive in."
39979,Homer,"well, don't just stand there, boy. help miss botz with her suitcases."
19964,Homer,"it should, but it doesn't. now who's going with daddy to the dump?"
14318,Homer,"well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
18142,Homer,"i hate my job. i mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
21246,Homer,well then...
19207,Homer,are you an angel?
37929,Homer,no.
29149,Homer,"we mean it, don't move."
22592,Homer,woo hoo! let's party!
35226,Homer,"oh yeah, a reward from cheech!"
27396,Homer,you'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
16656,Homer,this shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
40736,Homer,"so, what are you in for?"
33353,Homer,tears of a clown.
31133,Homer,"what a game! i got on the kiss-cam, i participated in ""the wave,"" and i got to pee in a trough! marge, can we get a trough?"
32863,Homer,quirky? quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! you made us look like monsters!
13867,Homer,"hmm. ""lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" yes! that's it!"
17163,Homer,hmmm.
35512,Homer,good ol' larry.
19917,Homer,"wow, i gotta start going to church."
26468,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. we'll call you. or send you some fruit."
18814,Homer,"you really blew it this time, smithers."
14939,Homer,i mean it made me feel bad. the poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. at least that's what i thought. i have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
26272,Homer,i'm with you all the way. but first...
27286,Homer,"mardi gras, eh? didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
33159,Homer,saving our marriage!
38862,Homer,potato chips!
32489,Homer,my what now?
16541,Homer,"no no, that's too expensive. just don't do it anymore."
39865,Homer,"and maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup."
31250,Homer,that shirley is quite a gal. we should fix her up with barney.
31441,Homer,"i would never let you down. our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. and trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. in cone-clusion, here's the scoop: i love you."
34943,Homer,fifty bucks?! that used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
26174,Homer,new shooter.
29874,Homer,"ray, you know me better than anyone. how can i get my wife to love me again?"
23247,Homer,"so i gave up tap for jazz, and i've never regretted it. and here's why..."
13188,Homer,kids? no way! you'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
26653,Homer,"we gotta get out and stop that initiative. marge, i'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos."
27249,Homer,"you monsters! you've turned this show into a ""survivor"" clone."
37478,Homer,the gates are locked.
29207,Homer,"oh, i'm so scared. ned flanders is pointing a gun at me. you couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if i whacked the barrel like this."
21931,Homer,heh. that's what i thought at first. but then i found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
31075,Homer,i know. i just thought maybe... boo!
19294,Homer,hey...
13543,Homer,"yes, i'm hearing one right now, while i'm trying to watch tv."
20681,Homer,"well, they put us on the ""waiting to exhale waiting list."" but they said don't hold your breath."
26336,Homer,"oh, what do i do? what do i do?"
19575,Homer,"hey, what's all that commotion outside? why, it's one of those pretzel wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
38758,Homer,oh...
30374,Homer,"noooo! bart, that's a really bad storage area!"
28749,Homer,uhh... i'll tell you what's goin' on...
29063,Homer,"what if he started pieing good people? not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
21490,Homer,"oh, we're surrounded, marge. maybe we should give ourselves up."
35587,Homer,ow!
19506,Homer,"don't worry, i have a plan. i saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. i think it was called ""the bus that couldn't slow down."" first, i hook this common vcr into the security camera system like so..."
14344,Homer,"oooh, that's a big lock all right. i just don't trust that guy."
13261,Homer,"man, you're annoying."
21488,Homer,gil! thank god it's you. you gotta help us.
37899,Homer,theaters? all i need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. care to join me?
30238,Homer,"i've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
17172,Homer,i made it the whole day without seeing her again.
18784,Homer,"yes, sir, i did."
27451,Homer,"dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
25818,Homer,are you coming on to me?
25950,Homer,probably digging for drugs.
24035,Homer,"son, go get me a trash bag."
26864,Homer,buh... guh... muh... wuh. zuh.
32825,Homer,bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
30211,Homer,that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
26347,Homer,"it's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
16848,Homer,hmmm. guess he didn't see me.
28327,Homer,"mr. macbeth, i'm really sorry."
35146,Homer,soda?
28292,Homer,no way! i'm saving for a speedboat!
30731,Homer,"at least you have something you're good at. i'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and i'm one snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. mmm, snickers pie."

31756,Homer,"i don't have to make a wish, because i already have this wonderful family. i wish for infinity hamburgers."
17973,Homer,wow. i'll never drink another beer.
19169,Homer,"son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. you've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. coming to me was a good start."
17494,Homer,so are you gonna say something nice now?
28028,Homer,"you know, i feel pretty good. maybe i should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar."
36620,Homer,"honey, i'm sorry. it's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids."
23158,Homer,"mel, you're coming off desperate. roll it, louie!"
19719,Homer,"you can't just kill off a classic tv character. poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. that's why i'm gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands."
21495,Homer,"i'm okay, honey. now listen very carefully. i want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing."
35675,Homer,"all the food in those pictures is poop by now. minds blown, you're welcome."
25586,Homer,"i told you, yes. now bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
27052,Homer,"if i was that drunk, i would remember it."
38667,Homer,"marge, i'd like you to meet leela and fry."
36982,Homer,"so, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
30412,Homer,"well, i got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad."
39478,Homer,when will i learn? the answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. heh-heh. they're on tv!
15790,Homer,we're going back to work!
34779,Homer,it was poisoned.
18573,Homer,that longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
17305,Homer,"hey, where is everybody?"
15219,Homer,"don't worry, baby. that tube'll know what to do."
21031,Homer,there! the perfect sheepshank.
33468,Homer,"beads, please."
19193,Homer,nothing.
24089,Homer,yeah.
36665,Homer,we're here to see abe simpson.
27193,Homer,no dice. take your fun and adventure outside.
20571,Homer,"""the end will come at sundown."" heh heh heh heh. hey, wait a second. i don't like the sound of that."
23421,Homer,really? but you've never given anyone a free beer.
28878,Homer,"i can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? sir, she is not an alcoholic! you can't put me on hold! i'll put you on hold!"
29197,Homer,"and while you're there, can you get my frisbee off the ledge?"
29094,Homer,there goes a good friend.
22710,Homer,wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? watching all the people come and go. you could have a different best friend every day.
14592,Homer,one hundred and thirty million dollars!
27422,Homer,how ironic. now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
38094,Homer,that man can't remember anything except our number!
22469,Homer,"no, i just thought it was cute when you called him..."
21624,Homer,"eh. oh. okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed."
13754,Homer,huh? ahhh!! it's my problem! we're doomed!!!
17152,Homer,hey! get off my sugar! bad bees! bad!
31669,Homer,simpson men get the job done!
24409,Homer,it worked! it's a miracle!
20278,Homer,i said i'll take it.
18173,Homer,"hooey! whew, oh. you know, i never walk out of a movie, but eech!"
23499,Homer,look at my babies. this tomato will be heinz ketchup. and this to-mah-to will be hunt's catsup.
33340,Homer,wait!
38550,Homer,hillbillies!
33663,Homer,i will never... know... the score!
35336,Homer,boy that's good.
23824,Homer,yes...
39266,Homer,"i want a word with you in santa's workshop, little boy. cover for me, elfie."
28046,Homer,"no, wait. it's still my ass. but your point is well taken. you see..."
38549,Homer,"don't worry, marge. they can't beat us. because we're family-run."
19851,Homer,now don't say that! alcohol is a way of life. alcohol is my way of life. and i aim to keep it!
34704,Homer,it's four am -- you kids should've been in bed a half hour ago!
15248,Homer,"that's it! whew, i'm glad one of us remembered. that could have been embarrassing."
36198,Homer,whee! i'm in me! / oh! / i love the down parts! here comes!
26693,Homer,i never found true happiness until i met marge.
19712,Homer,"well, at least i liked it. didn't i?"
40354,Homer,flanders! what are you doing here?
34962,Homer,can i keep the name after i'm done?
16242,Homer,mmmm... invisible cola.
38786,Homer,"headin' home, baby."
13688,Homer,"apple, apple, apple... come on candy bar. hey, i know you! you're that first apple i didn't want. that sinks it. i'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
40014,Homer,"eww, i hate that icky soup skin."
13454,Homer,"aw, nuts! extremely rare blood and i don't have it."
34387,Homer,i can't! latkes aren't as good as american pancakes.
25479,Homer,you read my mind. sooo...
14623,Homer,i thought maybe you...
25609,Homer,i'm sorry. i thought he was a party robot.
27900,Homer,"that's it, i'm writing a christmas carol. if i can make my own clothes, i can do anything."
21865,Homer,"oh, am i?"
25055,Homer,"one snow angel, comin' up."
23815,Homer,"anyway, where were we? hello? hello? they hung up."
34494,Homer,"drunk and disorderly? that's a little redundant. hey, uh, mind if i do a little ""spring cleaning?"""
34645,Homer,"yeah, padre. how innocuous are your flashbacks?"
20630,Homer,stupid heater! don't make me come in there!
19014,Homer,that was odd.
19456,Homer,"you know, i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and i would -- hey!!"
14372,Homer,sure! you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
38479,Homer,i told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
15527,Homer,"hmmm, false... no, wait. maybe it's true."
31455,Homer,"honey, you've been in there all day. you gotta eat something. why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? lasagna would be awesome. marge?"
37126,Homer,how can something that applies to bart apply to me? i'm so much older and wiser.
36616,Homer,"yeah, no kids to ruin it."
33220,Homer,lisa? lisa?
17831,Homer,ta-da!
36999,Homer,"uh-huh, where's the kids?"
17951,Homer,"yeah, well scooby doo can doo-doo... but jimmy carter is smarter!"
31887,Homer,"sex problem, eh?"
19245,Homer,we've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. hel-lo!
25513,Homer,problem: a pointy deity. and i've got the perfect solution.
32669,Homer,"for the next two hours, we'll be kid free. it'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall."
41032,Homer,you're fired! what is my brother paying you for?
31438,Homer,"marge, everything looks wonderful!"
19732,Homer,"oh, yeah. like when a clown dies."
37576,Homer,that kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
39720,Homer,"i'm glad you asked, son. being popular is the most important thing in the world."
37450,Homer,"and i'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. no one knows why."
39843,Homer,"there she is! hey, princess! it's me, the guy from the snap shot!"
13877,Homer,"whew, i'd hate to be that kid's father."
29093,Homer,i'm elvis. elvis jagger. elvis jagger abdul-jabbar.
32684,Homer,driver of a loaner car / much better than a / driver of my normal car...
14418,Homer,not duff dry... dallas.
37382,Homer,"now, for the record, i hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. i never hated the church itself. and now, finally, i believe in something bigger than myself."
37376,Homer,that would save us several hundred bucks.
14081,Homer,no!
28695,Homer,flanders!
23820,Homer,jesus?
19140,Homer,no?
30649,Homer,"i know, and he's magic!"
21078,Homer,uhhh... it's my first day!
37723,Homer,"majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness."
29594,Homer,"wow, those jackets are beautiful."
39315,Homer,we got one?
40814,Homer,i gotta get outta here.
33866,Homer,i can't leave my bachelor pad! my bros'll miss me!
22279,Homer,woo! not over! wooooo!
16547,Homer,"aw, what a gyp."
31904,Homer,"well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover."
30745,Homer,ow! someone's hitting my butt with something!
18988,Homer,"well, homer, this is it. time to get back with the people. the young people."
34747,Homer,"sorry, marge. the last time i stepped on a baseball field, i got tased."
25741,Homer,"then i'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
14410,Homer,dallas! whoo-hoo!
15540,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
39581,Homer,where's the video boxing?
36228,Homer,i feel sorry for people without willpower. i truly do.
37590,Homer,so i heard half of nothing.
17830,Homer,"heh-heh, good one, krusty."
34534,Homer,i'm starting to regret it already.
33061,Homer,i don't want your pity booze. i'll pay for it myself.
19620,Homer,"oh, man, you are so right. did you ever sit like this?"
19161,Homer,yeah yeah.
16742,Homer,less shame?
36254,Homer,"i just have to press this button, right..."
21781,Homer,"sorry, lady. i know you. you're kim basinger"
18581,Homer,"oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
27617,Homer,"i'd like a large fries, please. and a collector's cup."
27302,Homer,"nonetheless, the people have spoken."
32888,Homer,"that's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. in fact, i don't even want your pie."
25947,Homer,that was close.
30132,Homer,it was all just a dream.
34036,Homer,calendar! oh my god! i forgot to move carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
17213,Homer,no.
28994,Homer,"at last, we're alone..."
38683,Homer,a haircut? let me see!
26536,Homer,"son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. called ""ghostbusters."""
37745,Homer,the scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.
18617,Homer,it's easier. duh.
31515,Homer,christian charity? what does a porn star have to do with this? he's gotta go!
18166,Homer,say it burns. say i never shot you... before.
25727,Homer,"this place is so boring. i've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. i know, i'll breed the pets. to each other."
39670,Homer,honey! honey! we're saved!
37640,Homer,taste the strength of your fiancé!
21677,Homer,"well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. where's bart?"
15403,Homer,"patience, my pet."
31249,Homer,"of course i can make a credenza, whatever that is. just give all the details to my secretary shirley."
13938,Homer,ohh... i need money.
16892,Homer,"oh. good luck. look at these bills. ""chain for elephant,"" ""shots for elephant""... ""oversized decorative poncho""."

18012,Homer,did they?!
18263,Homer,thanks flanders. i have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
35929,Homer,just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an i.o.u.
34923,Homer,whose turn is it to cry?
31800,Homer,"up, up, and annoy!"
26878,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. i know who stopped up the toilet!"
41056,Homer,"so what does my little girl want? what? let me write this down. copies of ""teen dream... teen scream... and teen steam magazine."" well, okay. you're the sickie. goodbye, lisa."
15549,Homer,y'ello.
20636,Homer,"c'mon, kids. let's try the lights!"
16954,Homer,"bart, you're coming home."
37175,Homer,just my honey pie.
18365,Homer,woo hoo! four more pounds and my dream comes true: working at home...
21991,Homer,"hey, i'm trying to drive here!"
20722,Homer,"yeah, he's telling the truth."
28838,Homer,he's in the house?
26875,Homer,here's my underwear drawer.
32958,Homer,"okay boy, this is it. five dollars!"
16382,Homer,"i don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, i'll just say yes."
24077,Homer,then we star-wipe to flanders brushing his...
15635,Homer,i just press this button and the door opens like magic.
14791,Homer,that's it. he's outta here.
30627,Homer,"yes, tell us your story. but it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. and you'd better make us root for the protagonist."
23601,Homer,"this is the end / my only friend, the end / weird scenes inside the gold mine..."
18060,Homer,i blew it again.
26716,Homer,that guy's hilarious. i especially like his white shirt and blue pants. wait a second... angry dad is me!
36110,Homer,the phone's dead.
30751,Homer,i'll kill you! i'll kill your whole family!
26918,Homer,people with heads?
19704,Homer,"hey, it really is you! how'd you get to be so good?"
24888,Homer,i bit my tongue!
38271,Homer,"oh, are the kids with you?"
30949,Homer,are you kavi?

30537,Homer,"please, you're embarrassing me."
25508,Homer,reach into these holes. i use a carrot.
22272,Homer,"you'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens."
15728,Homer,deer.
17718,Homer,"well who wouldn't be upset? that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday! hey, where're you going?"
37729,Homer,can you give me the morphine forever?
37426,Homer,"the way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
18027,Homer,get that cat out of the way!
30543,Homer,"oh, i hate press conferences."
26063,Homer,you're right.
28401,Homer,"finally, science has joined forces with revenge."
24282,Homer,"shh, quiet."
37411,Homer,"no tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. thank you, fashion police."
16141,Homer,"lisa, don't spoil our fun!"
33604,Homer,"so, what can't people do in modern ireland?"
37457,Homer,i wasn't thinking that! carl's our good friend.
37917,Homer,what are you guys in for?
38293,Homer,"uh, yeah. hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and i should have dinner together, sometime..."
25494,Homer,everybody was kung-fu fighting...

13624,Homer,wowww -- a shoehorn! just like in the movies!
34205,Homer,i'm alive! and surrounded by the...people i love the most in the...
29448,Homer,"hey, what's this lump?"

16510,Homer,twenty- one? do that card-counting thing again! come on. do it again.
30610,Homer,"now we have to drive it straight to rome, where it'll be shipped to mr. burns in springfield."
27958,Homer,"son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. it really restores your faith in helpful weirdos."
39680,Homer,maggie! oh my little girl!
19857,Homer,"heh, rex banner. what a dope."
40609,Homer,"it's so hard to choose. it all looks so terrible. just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those."
20716,Homer,a novelty comb! kings among men...
19022,Homer,"sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
41434,Homer,i never realized you had so much work done.
27542,Homer,la la la la la la la la la.
20085,Homer,"'evening, moe."
41255,Homer,"something was said: not good. what was it? ""don't yell at homer."" no, that's okay. what was it? ""slow."" they called you ""slow!"""
29052,Homer,"i'll keep my promise, honey."
18196,Homer,i have listening skills!
28101,Homer,"without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
39415,Homer,what?
17195,Homer,marge?
17516,Homer,i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
24999,Homer,dad?
15172,Homer,"no, it's true. you know, when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher's mitt. but, my dad wouldn't get it for me. so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. the doctor thought i might have brain damage."
29512,Homer,easy... gentle...
28812,Homer,i'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
19378,Homer,hmm. i don't remember a bowling alley being th--
38139,Homer,"yeah, these seem great. oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."

17470,Homer,ow!
22978,Homer,shuuuut uppa you mouth.
35284,Homer,why didn't you tell me not to come?
35566,Homer,paddles down! it's the only way to change the system!
26211,Homer,you can't kick me out. it'll cause a miscount in the census. a miscount!
17398,Homer,"thanks, kids."
37049,Homer,"lenny, take us with you to find our dog! it's okay, marge, they're professionals."
20126,Homer,mmmmm.
30000,Homer,"i don't miss meat at all. this portobello mushroom eats like a steak. a rubbery, fungus-like steak."
32823,Homer,"son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. also, don't be a cow."
26559,Homer,don't you know the boys from brazil are little hitlers? i saw it in a movie. whose name i can't remember.
21779,Homer,"aw, nuts."
30971,Homer,"see, it goes: ship's wheel, popeye tattoo, gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
26299,Homer,"four tickets for ""shenani-goats!""."
22299,Homer,i have a problem.
26415,Homer,i have a boyle on my ass.
36350,Homer,"lousy marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his tv show... i'd tell my best friend, but that's marge too..."
38750,Homer,"apu, what's wrong?"
21402,Homer,"i'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, superman."
33386,Homer,you lie. you love me!
35751,Homer,"but the trolls were the best part! do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""
22916,Homer,"idiots! ooh, these are fun!"
35236,Homer,"marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" well, sometimes people can be too."
13727,Homer,"hey, look what i got. a genuine official police badge... calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
23512,Homer,"did you see the way emile's lookin' at mindy? hoo-hoo, i think something's going on there."
30659,Homer,"i know, it's weird, isn't it?"
16131,Homer,yes.
29429,Homer,"flanders? i don't know... i mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday."
39673,Homer,wah neh! wah neh!
25486,Homer,that's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
26478,Homer,"wow, a booth. if i'm tired, i can just lie down!"
39064,Homer,stop laughing at me!
18176,Homer,"marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
25185,Homer,and his fondness for the guitar.

38424,Homer,so... where are all the friends?
41514,Homer,"hey thanks, moe."

31530,Homer,a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
30459,Homer,"yeah, sure. whatever you want. ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
17826,Homer,okay.
24650,Homer,"loyal citizens of new springfield. you stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all."
24411,Homer,no shade!
40755,Homer,"well, what interest does she have that i could make common?"
26771,Homer,"here, guys."
37968,Homer,as long as we keep drinking this.
36440,Homer,woo hoo!
19153,Homer,"well, it's pretty important."
16531,Homer,ow...ow...ow...ow.
30010,Homer,"you did it, sweetie!"
21318,Homer,"no, not there."
24992,Homer,"yes, son?"
15811,Homer,you guys must have been pretty worried about me.
39043,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! you saved my life. which is gonna make what i'm about to say even more awkward...
19452,Homer,hiya.
24199,Homer,because you're all terrible sinners.
36686,Homer,well just what attracted you to my father?
23502,Homer,"addictive, eh?"
39076,Homer,do you guys serve snacks?
35297,Homer,why you... i'm gonna... maybe this time...
28302,Homer,can you describe the bill?
24787,Homer,woo hoo!
27559,Homer,"hey, my dad was lousy and i didn't sue him. i just dumped him in the cheapest home i could find."
38904,Homer,don't you people realize your queen is dying?
20795,Homer,really? i'm surprised about maggie.
21331,Homer,huh?
17776,Homer,it must be the first of the month! new billboard day!
20198,Homer,get the hell out.
33247,Homer,what's the matter? don't like the taste of freedom?
36035,Homer,"all right, everybody in!"
28286,Homer,i wish i'd married a businessman. then i'd have nice things.
28886,Homer,marge!
40506,Homer,pick - up - a - ham - mer...
41303,Homer,don't blow the surprise. pretend you forgot.
20942,Homer,"hurry, moe. at three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. the exercise yard!"
37962,Homer,i didn't tell you about the basement.
26714,Homer,my ice cream sandwich! then where the hell's the remote?!
22826,Homer,take the kids out back.
16237,Homer,"all right, but remember it's mine."
22006,Homer,"oh, we've gotta get home. i don't wanna miss, ""inside the actor's studio."" tonight it's f. murray abraham."
28520,Homer,unloved by all! noooooooo!
13855,Homer,"oh, i hate having two heads."
28794,Homer,"relax, stupid. everything you see is make believe. although it is based on a true story. some of which happened in this very theater."
38514,Homer,i'm dropping the anchor!
17524,Homer,"but marge, you deserve a vacation. it's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
23352,Homer,"hey maude, i'm home. uh-oh. i think i'm having a heart attack."
17362,Homer,i love bart!
25718,Homer,maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
35278,Homer,"well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. but, oh, you know, the other day, bart, the little dickens, said i had an elephant butt. so anyway, i'm strangling him, and i said to bart..."
35087,Homer,let's see if this works.
26673,Homer,but i can't find you funny anymore.
41505,Homer,mom! mom! mom!
39432,Homer,"okay, now look. my boss is gonna be at this picnic, so i want you to show your father some love and/or respect."
23600,Homer,"save your tears, moe. save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope."
34481,Homer,do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?
34717,Homer,no fair! we just went to church!
27524,Homer,aw... he thinks he's papal.
38283,Homer,"oh, i can fake attentive. i've been watching a football game this whole discussion."
31445,Homer,"sorry, i'm all out of ice cream."
38351,Homer,i think that's about to change.
22508,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i got something really special planned for valentine's day."
13943,Homer,but i eat... oh.

31882,Homer,"hey, get off my case! he's the choke artist!"
39996,Homer,mmmm.

26644,Homer,you just said it!
21175,Homer,"good boy, mojo. now, bring 'em down and i'll give you one."
15220,Homer,"marge, get my gun."
28727,Homer,nope.
38700,Homer,what about mosquito cove?
19608,Homer,"hey, this sounds like fun."
25928,Homer,"shhh, you'll wake up flanders..."
14377,Homer,"moe, twenty-three dollars on new york."
13704,Homer,daddly-doodly.
36360,Homer,"oh, marge... your names..."
38156,Homer,i don't know what you're talking about. hide the treasure!
25992,Homer,"wow, well i i almost fainted, but then i didn't. what are you doing?"
21324,Homer,"look at you people. bart's a tub, lisa's weak as a little girl, and maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
23557,Homer,really?
21010,Homer,there's a question that's crossed out.
38241,Homer,i'm listening. and it better be devastating.
29994,Homer,but it's my burger.
14680,Homer,"that's right, except for the pick-up truck."
17778,Homer,best in the west. it rhymes.
25239,Homer,"get that one! faster! you got half time for the other ones. oh, good. oh no, that one's slowing up! oh, good. oh, that one's wobbling! oh, up... you got that before i even said it."
31912,Homer,"good work, boy. just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
14606,Homer,"take a hike boss, i'm running things now."
37352,Homer,which one?
19752,Homer,"oh, and i'm not."
30084,Homer,"when the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
16416,Homer,"watch this, guys."
34635,Homer,all right.
30209,Homer,"all pancakes aside, i really came here to talk about my son."
14810,Homer,nah.
22953,Homer,can do.
21297,Homer,"oh, stop it!"
41567,Homer,spread yellow gunk / on my pancake heart / country-churned girl / in my grocery cart
38804,Homer,gimme another one.
17070,Homer,"marge, you'll never guess what. my whole class is here. they're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
19554,Homer,"as a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say..."
25870,Homer,i used to be.
19353,Homer,whaddya mean?
33009,Homer,"you've got to roll it from the point. here, let me show you."
29556,Homer,"but then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide!"
20428,Homer,"well, i'm not gonna make the same mistake. from now on i'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my dad."
39567,Homer,"lisa, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to yell. go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy."
17840,Homer,"all bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to australia?"
39997,Homer,so?
41003,Homer,"well, then give me one with lots of pep."
27625,Homer,hey! don't borgnine my sandwich.
14156,Homer,no!
33618,Homer,i need that paper quick!
27942,Homer,fresca?!
31139,Homer,"hey, we've gone through more hardships than the jews and charlie brown put together."
29265,Homer,your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
19346,Homer,"no, it's a second wedding, honey. our first one was so crummy, i had to make it up to you. i really love you."
27078,Homer,to rock!
19436,Homer,where am i? shelbyville?
26388,Homer,"oh, i can't take his money... i can't print my own money... i have to work for money... why don't i just lie down and die?"
33782,Homer,"but, you..."
23836,Homer,"that it is. we'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married."
16414,Homer,give seven hundred krustyburgers!
18631,Homer,"well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
38013,Homer,wait a minute. marge said we were out of ice cream.
27915,Homer,if you despise polite left-handers...
38417,Homer,"okay, i slept on the couch, and i flipped the sweaty cushions over. what else can i do?"
13802,Homer,"no, that's it. you've seen everything."
23382,Homer,stop! ow!
28628,Homer,you really think so?
28953,Homer,give her back to skinner! a fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
26637,Homer,"""could jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that he himself could not eat it?"""
31157,Homer,if only i'd seen you before i met my wife.
18492,Homer,"oh, yeah... but what i'll mainly remember is the laughter. i wonder what he's doing now?"
32324,Homer,point one oh with a stomach full of bread. my final offer.
41307,Homer,"homer simpson! do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? what would jesus do?"
38133,Homer,"you don't have children, do you?"
25731,Homer,"oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. stupid flanders."
36703,Homer,he's a good boy.
28558,Homer,"whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!"
19558,Homer,marge! kids! they're about to show my videotape!
33912,Homer,"finally, the answer to my problem. what do you do?"
31878,Homer,i don't work here.
19931,Homer,he better know how to keep his mouth shut.
32020,Homer,move it!
19457,Homer,knock it off!
21075,Homer,bart!
30793,Homer,"don't leave me! i hate to be alone! except when i'm watching tv, then leave me alone. but right now, don't leave!"
13544,Homer,bart! shut up or i'll shut you up!
22453,Homer,uh-oh. here comes lorne michaels. pretend you don't see him.
16252,Homer,i'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
37781,Homer,"but you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
36946,Homer,can't i keep an eye on that kid? he's fabulous.
18904,Homer,"all right, that does it. if i'm gonna be trapped inside the house i gotta go out and buy some beer."
14025,Homer,"i'll just sit here in ""li'l lightnin'"" -- which the simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, i had a son."
24613,Homer,how the hell did they find that out?
36504,Homer,there's the gap!
19682,Homer,you little...
31773,Homer,moderately wealthy?
32674,Homer,even better -- a tale of ... one moment.
22968,Homer,tilt? you monster!
26032,Homer,i would.
13172,Homer,now's my chance.
37556,Homer,how did we get here?
29314,Homer,woo hoo! i don't know the difference!
31463,Homer,marge?
26868,Homer,"book 'im, lou."
37096,Homer,check mate.
19418,Homer,fine. i'll come find you when i'm ready to stop having fun.
30493,Homer,what a great father's day!
17849,Homer,"no. it's pretty big, i guess."
33678,Homer,"ooh, maggie made some new friends."
34814,Homer,come and get it.
21623,Homer,and now you're ready for a night on the town.
40178,Homer,"-- surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"
37192,Homer,"writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of dui's. the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs."
35816,Homer,"so, everybody good?"
39698,Homer,where is it. the game... where is it?
21791,Homer,you shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the gersh agency. you should let me do your shopping. i know where i can get you some great muffins.
18634,Homer,"hey, big spender!..."
23183,Homer,"it's your plan, from ""braveheart."" your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
25898,Homer,moe? what the?...
39499,Homer,why you...
15535,Homer,what if i sing to you? i gave my love a chicken that had no bone/ mmmm chicken.
28725,Homer,"marge, i'm not gonna lie to you..."
36380,Homer,"hey, wait for me!"
24906,Homer,how did i get here? what is this place?
23319,Homer,"i don't need lisa to write a good review. ""the food at the gilded truffle really..."" uh... what's a good word?"
38239,Homer,yes. but knowing that lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
40307,Homer,who'd've thought it? a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game. every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand.
18828,Homer,okay. grampa.
40043,Homer,miracle breakthrough! there's been a miracle breakthrough?
31624,Homer,i have returned!
27612,Homer,"hey, who doesn't?"
18230,Homer,why? that was the problem in the first place. you were going broke because we were your only customers. wasn't that the problem in the first place? that you were going broke... moe?
36057,Homer,helmet? that's springfield talk.
34331,Homer,"that was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
22434,Homer,"max power doesn't abbreviate. each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. maybe more important. no, as important."
28633,Homer,keep me focused.
38579,Homer,"so... yeah. things aren't perfect with the missus and me. and by the way, nice melons."
21247,Homer,"well then, can't someone else do it?"
34629,Homer,"marge, have u left me 4..."
32228,Homer,marge!
22285,Homer,whoop! careful.
35549,Homer,"no, not the middle seat!"
14576,Homer,uh uh.
28263,Homer,brambles! briars!
30835,Homer,fine. as soon as i finish watching my show.
35589,Homer,"oh, marge. this is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!"
26318,Homer,"well, as much as humanly possible."
32103,Homer,please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
29508,Homer,"oh, the prid is gone."
35853,Homer,i'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.
32668,Homer,"good, 'cause i'm parking at it right now."
15233,Homer,"gonna run out the clock in florida, eh?"
34473,Homer,"better lie low, my sweet red friend."
19297,Homer,yoink.
27318,Homer,frank grimes...
33891,Homer,killing makes me hun-gry
22773,Homer,"yeah, just like yesterday."
14857,Homer,this is the greatest invention in the world! you'll make a million dollars!
38952,Homer,ask for boogers on bart's half!
41328,Homer,woo hoo!
27919,Homer,"what? it said ""take one."""
26948,Homer,"i've been driving all night, hand's wet on the wheel... there's a voice in my head that drives my heel... it's my baby callin' on the telephone... i got some pizza and i'm bringin' it home..."
39848,Homer,thank you very much ma'am. we'll be out of your...
24543,Homer,missed me! stupid horoscope!
28611,Homer,"not so rough, bart. daddy can't handle so much love right now."
36714,Homer,you wha?
19779,Homer,"ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! the whole world's gone gay!"
24886,Homer,i'm mr. x! gimme! gimme!
33177,Homer,"no, this is about you. edna wants to break up."
13284,Homer,i peed my pants.
27242,Homer,"all right, let's see what we've got here."
37249,Homer,"give him one of your famous murmurs, marge."
27576,Homer,"for your information, i've been taking steps to become a better father."
17138,Homer,"read your town charter, boy. ""if food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" since i don't see him around, start shoveling."
41561,Homer,fine. cohiba me.
37735,Homer,it's a tough economy. money doesn't grow on trees.
36993,Homer,see? these are our bug-out bags. in here is everything we need to survive.
21149,Homer,yes!
15350,Homer,"barney, that's great. when two best friends work together, not even god, himself, can stop them."
39969,Homer,"no. i said sampson, not simpson."
19742,Homer,couldn't agree more. happy as a clam.
22313,Homer,passing out in the ocean...
15965,Homer,"far out, man. i haven't seen a bong in years."
34057,Homer,in springfield.
30772,Homer,"marge, i ripped my pants! the only pants that understand my complex hiney."
24815,Homer,you're right. it's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
39717,Homer,"wow! look at these bowling balls, maggie. can you think of a better way for daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?"
33315,Homer,"sweetie, i have a very special surprise for you."
33750,Homer,well i hope your son enjoys being driven around by the president of the united states.
30029,Homer,do you know the hours i worked? the people i had to yell at? the tires i had to slash?
32293,Homer,what? i'm still in springfield.
18744,Homer,"of course i do. you're always right about this type of thing, and for once, i want in on the ground floor."
14323,Homer,"why, you little --"
29244,Homer,and i kept that vow.
36994,Homer,the looming kablooey.
20335,Homer,"pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. i tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
29269,Homer,stupid bart. bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
30112,Homer,and there's the earth. so beautiful with your many rings.
13856,Homer,y'ello.
14347,Homer,line...
26980,Homer,uh-huh!
41268,Homer,mental note: steal his idea.
29805,Homer,"that's right, an unauthorized tattoo. i came here right away."
16177,Homer,my life can't get any worse.
34532,Homer,months?
35341,Homer,oh my god!
19450,Homer,"aw, i hate this place! why am i here?!"
26567,Homer,and in february... it's hot?
38720,Homer,i understand. i already signed up for this place next year. i gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
24223,Homer,"well, it's time to get some closure. extreme closure."
16654,Homer,"oh, stomach churning... bowels clenching... not much time. must finish."
34367,Homer,why you...
40300,Homer,"okay, here are your tickets. they're supposed to be good. you're sitting with the player's wives. and don't forget to cheer for me."
17342,Homer,"come here, you butterball."
39458,Homer,"look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. we've got to do better as a family. so tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the tv. we're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
23226,Homer,"well, if you want one, they sell 'em at..."
35111,Homer,"sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims."
23951,Homer,who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
33856,Homer,be sure to dig around in the gunk.
38369,Homer,fat tony?
36781,Homer,what would you have me do? one basket for each egg?
25330,Homer,"oh, that's loser talk!"
22896,Homer,"no, i'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. you'll always be the artist in the family."
31753,Homer,then i must flee!
14232,Homer,i do.
31686,Homer,"you see declan, i made my millions with a simple invention -- ""the condiment pen""!"
23997,Homer,"racehorse, eh?"
13449,Homer,"joke's on them. if the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
35682,Homer,too sad to walk! too sad and fun to walk...
19895,Homer,the guy who took your job.
19155,Homer,"aw, those jerks. always walking over the small businessman. don't get me started about the government."
19547,Homer,we'll fake it and sell it to the fox network.
32270,Homer,"man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
23175,Homer,"movies aren't stupid! they fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""lethal weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
40687,Homer,damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
15766,Homer,molto bene.
30535,Homer,only three?
30831,Homer,don't pressure me. i get enough of that from my dad.
25566,Homer,"now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
34886,Homer,stupid dog! let go of that delicious bird!
26437,Homer,swell.
22436,Homer,just takin' care of business.
29693,Homer,"oh, look at him sleeping. he's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. yes you are... yes you are!"
40972,Homer,"hello, is this h. powell of detroit, michigan?"
22734,Homer,"look, son. it's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy."
24273,Homer,shut up.
13587,Homer,huh? huh?
36736,Homer,huh? what?
24287,Homer,get outta my dreams and into my car.
28161,Homer,this is for snowball one and jfk!
37511,Homer,"fine, i'm going home."
32881,Homer,"you're right, boy!"
37011,Homer,"now we're going to leave this place. i'm sorry, bart -- i know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
32283,Homer,i'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
37184,Homer,we've found what we're looking for.
26402,Homer,in south carolina.
26007,Homer,"okay, look cool."
33686,Homer,"in a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
18622,Homer,the guy who doesn't live there.
26045,Homer,"and i'm thankful i get to spend thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."
22788,Homer,"where do you think you're going, missy?"
38219,Homer,much better.
18561,Homer,"get 'im, ma!"
36956,Homer,"i made it, kids! i am king of learning-ton castle!"
34893,Homer,even my tramp stamp?
21245,Homer,aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
15377,Homer,i can't afford that!
26096,Homer,perfect. i'll be there at seven.
37571,Homer,"hello, everyone."
36055,Homer,"we found a new home! when god shuts a door, he opens a window."
23812,Homer,it's the bread of astronauts.
16253,Homer,candy and sodas for all!
35899,Homer,"well, if i could explain myself..."
29722,Homer,spider poison is people poison?!
21162,Homer,just the monkey then.
18483,Homer,"do i know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
16937,Homer,"that's it, boy. you're our last hope."
19676,Homer,"come to bed, marge."
29172,Homer,"i'm always happy to help you, sweetie."
41172,Homer,"all right, scale. you don't like me and i don't like you, but i've been very good, so you better treat me right."
37408,Homer,"they're like a wedding ring, i can't take them off anymore."
30636,Homer,"i love you, marge."
24417,Homer,"okay, now am i the only one on fire? good."
40314,Homer,what a family.
27357,Homer,i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
24255,Homer,sure we can't talk you into it?
29102,Homer,she wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
18596,Homer,"""they made us!"" that's loser talk! you gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! nothing's gonna stop us now!"
19651,Homer,"oh, there's no way i could --"
13386,Homer,"ohhh, because i got drunk and looked down her dress."
36451,Homer,they cannot judge me. only my father can judge me.
14910,Homer,"bart, don't ask stupid questions. is there any frontal nudity?"
40416,Homer,"son, this is a tradition. if you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce."
32851,Homer,where'd everybody go?
37605,Homer,you laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
13626,Homer,stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
38797,Homer,"yeah?! well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!"
16409,Homer,i stole it from that borgnine guy.
13933,Homer,no.
40508,Homer,"no, i can't. it's broken."
20215,Homer,unless what?
31504,Homer,greystash! greystash!
27024,Homer,eat... my... shorts?! why you little...
30457,Homer,i'll give you five dollars for it.
25746,Homer,it knows you're afraid.
25099,Homer,huh? what is this crap?
23464,Homer,"oh, that's just superstition."
40209,Homer,"if it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?"
13223,Homer,"coming, chief."
32951,Homer,to your mother's purse!
34224,Homer,"lenny... and carl... a fortune cookie... i ran into the candy machine... and i found an emerson, lake, and palmer..."
24119,Homer,"okay homer, don't panic. let me do the talking."
32301,Homer,"okay, i get it. i'm not stupid. it's number two, right?"

14843,Homer,"marge, there's an empty spot i've always had inside me. i tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. but those were dead ends. i think this chair is the answer."
33325,Homer,"friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it."
14393,Homer,"barney, are you nuts? that's the super bowl. how about the sunday after that?"

16938,Homer,"okay, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say. just read it and you're a shoo-in."
31600,Homer,"i didn't write that! even if i did love england, i'd play it cool. wait for it to come to me."
40615,Homer,"and, oh, oh, i don't believe i've tried the flying fish roe..."
40729,Homer,some people call me a space cowboy / yeah / some call me the gangster of love / some people call me maurice. woo woo / 'cause i speak of the puppets oh of love.
37495,Homer,"""when the barbarian invaders came, the carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."

15154,Homer,"now, what were we talking about, boy?"
40791,Homer,femme.
33524,Homer,"yeah, right! and i'm married to wonder woman!"
36617,Homer,"marge, i was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda."
40622,Homer,"oh, i couldn't possibly."
35621,Homer,"woo hoo! oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
22383,Homer,isn't bad? tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.

34866,Homer,where's the other girder?
30898,Homer,"there's this guy that got killed -- i think it was in miami? so c.s.i. miami investiga-ted-ed it. then a family said how much they loved the olive garden. then i fell asleep. when i woke up, letterman was talking to alias."
18304,Homer,do not touch willie. good advice.
22834,Homer,so you'd better catch the fever. catch it...
27552,Homer,jesus?! i thought it was gepetto!
28075,Homer,"i'm gonna treat marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
21076,Homer,"i'll plug your hole. i mean, eureka!"
15921,Homer,lobooo...
33727,Homer,too much cherry!
34212,Homer,"here i am a millionaire, and i can't even help the woman who gave birth to me."
27503,Homer,"you know, i used to think god only helped professional athletes and grammy winners. but now i realize he helps shmoes like me, too, carl."
37690,Homer,you only live once.
30972,Homer,my life's work ruined.
24176,Homer,"now, let's open it up to some q & a."
40395,Homer,"news flash, lisa! bart is not a horse. eat your steak, boy."
36856,Homer,"homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. if i show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then i've failed! and these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"
37560,Homer,"even better, i never unpacked from the time we went to hawaii."
30052,Homer,"how 'bout ""i love you, honey?"""
39090,Homer,"marge, you're my wife of ten years and i love you. but i must observe the teachings of this man i just met tonight. now, the first thing i have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
38407,Homer,"you know, i have more cheeks."
16980,Homer,"okay, fine."
28114,Homer,"boy, that slaked my thirst."
14140,Homer,"well, they can't fire me."
14651,Homer,the cat? what's the point?
19675,Homer,i'll say. her butt waxed the banister.
19761,Homer,no.
38461,Homer,i don't!
40146,Homer,they are all against me! they all must die!
21421,Homer,it is? well... that's a good song too. do do do do-do do do...
24008,Homer,"that horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
21980,Homer,"aren't you proud of your big sister, mr. pinchy? hmm? hmm?"
20344,Homer,"close your eyes marge, i've got a surprise for you."
28544,Homer,hmm. you've given me a lot to think about.
32556,Homer,bo-ring.
26373,Homer,"i'm leaving you, marge. the next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. don't worry about the kids -- i'll drop 'em off with patty and selma."
28736,Homer,"but marge, it was all for you. to buy you all the nice things you deserve. the flowers, the earrings, the bob seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
25097,Homer,animotion.
34334,Homer,i was too! the words were in my brain!
17523,Homer,"good news, everybody. because i endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
30276,Homer,moe! will you get off the line!
36730,Homer,are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
20916,Homer,what about the cops?
38759,Homer,"i think i can answer for apu. he's flattered, but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted."
13156,Homer,"hm, i guess it's row versus wade. and it's my right to choose."
39072,Homer,hmmm.
26569,Homer,so hot snow falls up?
38992,Homer,it's good to be back.
18275,Homer,"i don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
21406,Homer,don't ever say that.
18239,Homer,"it was good, but not great."
37213,Homer,no fatties!
37849,Homer,dick fiddler!
32402,Homer,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
39390,Homer,"hey, you idiot! watch where you're going!"
41016,Homer,"uh, yeah, i think i did."
19300,Homer,"oh, i hate having parties. the toilet always gets backed up."

38039,Homer,where's that cake now?
37329,Homer,you're all i have left. i trust you completely.
14189,Homer,"yes, sir."
31082,Homer,at least she's found someone who can make her happy.
27800,Homer,mmm... bad eggs.
37696,Homer,so sad.
17676,Homer,such a nice tidy office. maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
34683,Homer,"but if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
32150,Homer,"okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
18664,Homer,"okay, son! give him the glue!"
32181,Homer,"come on, we're leaving! mmm, after one more mini-quiche..."
30951,Homer,sorry i'm late. i was doing carnak with my bodyguard.
27417,Homer,"in retrospect, yes."
38061,Homer,"more like ""at your six-pack,"" am i right? it's okay if you need to take a little nap."
30918,Homer,you're a useless old man! name one thing you do for this family.
18909,Homer,"oh, i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year."
31113,Homer,onions in the peas! what the hell?
23181,Homer,"great idea, mel. now it's my turn."
19823,Homer,"militants, huh? well, if i were you, i'd kick their asses."
35534,Homer,"of course. i mean, how long could it be?"
13239,Homer,"yeah, falls'll getcha."
24952,Homer,i know that. how much to fix it?
20838,Homer,"i can't make it in today, mr. smithers. i have smallpox... well, it wasn't wiped out in my house."
25867,Homer,tethered?!
38993,Homer,can we cuddle for a little while?
13229,Homer,"you can run, but you can't glide!"
35666,Homer,"look, honey, a family's like a team. and on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee."
35526,Homer,completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...
38849,Homer,look! i see land!
39063,Homer,woo hoo!
37516,Homer,i'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
39477,Homer,huh... what?
19825,Homer,i'll have to ask her.
38766,Homer,you know what? apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. we're gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left.
24961,Homer,a good son would come through for his dad!
27403,Homer,you're charging how much for a room?
27767,Homer,"that's great, honey. hold it up to the camera."
18022,Homer,"you're lucky you got looks, marge."
20537,Homer,that doesn't matter. the important thing is we won.
24468,Homer,"hey, yeah. you could load it up with lots of swears. that's what david mamet does."
18095,Homer,you're cooking what for dinner?
15069,Homer,bless you boys.
18526,Homer,"oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic."
40574,Homer,"yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. no, thank you."
22456,Homer,"well, i spend a lot of time on the couch..."
29806,Homer,"who? oh, that ""my mother."" tell him thanks."
40092,Homer,"rainy day. there's never gonna be a be a rainy day, marge. there's not a cloud in the simpson sky. and what does my little girl want?"
32702,Homer,"sure! why, what did ya have in mind?"
31792,Homer,"well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
32857,Homer,what?
36283,Homer,when i'm done with my robo-botomies.
27350,Homer,more free samples.
39107,Homer,"thanks, lady."
25208,Homer,next!
18914,Homer,uh-huh.
35600,Homer,"yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
23852,Homer,one million times...
22881,Homer,not the reichstag!
36300,Homer,no... no...
37052,Homer,"maybe! look, you guys obviously know about weather, but i understand something much more predictable: women."
34168,Homer,i guess these days headhunters can be anything.
23302,Homer,i've given out my share of bad reviews.
13680,Homer,"boy, those germans have a word for everything."
31751,Homer,spooky.
29231,Homer,"i'm saying goodbye to everything i ever loved. ooh, a marshmallow!"
14513,Homer,what if i see something really weird in the sky?
40685,Homer,that's sorta nice. what are you in for?
17922,Homer,"oh, okay marge, i'll get along with them. then i will hug some snakes! yes, i will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. now that's sarcasm."
31695,Homer,"it's been another eight years, and what do i have? same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
40765,Homer,wait a minute! that word you keep calling me --
31789,Homer,okay.
40734,Homer,i... i don't know!
39644,Homer,"well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
36985,Homer,do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt.
40811,Homer,"one of each, please."
20639,Homer,can - we - skip - church?
31998,Homer,"hey, get your own yogurt!"
34872,Homer,"no, i'm no-ot! yes i am. the bloody hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of london..."
26043,Homer,"hey, who invited the hippies?"
25952,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll find out what he's up to. kids shouldn't have secrets."
22034,Homer,"but i don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. why didn't somebody tell me what i was volunteering for? this is everybody's fault but mine."
30100,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. huh?
32626,Homer,i can't stand to see a grown burger cry. we must rebuild fast food boulevard!
20839,Homer,"water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice..."
40077,Homer,"you got it, buddy!"
16140,Homer,now i'm not saying mr. burns is incontinent...
34818,Homer,nooooo!
27988,Homer,"a plan, eh? okay, we'll use a plan."
29011,Homer,no one does that to my daughter!
15178,Homer,"ah, sweet soft-hearted marge. you just can't see the big picture. if i stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the supreme court. if i fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""mister tight buns"" competition. i can't let that happen, i won't let that happen and i can't let that happen."
37137,Homer,knock yourself out.
37294,Homer,when we got married i promised you a life full of romance. now here it is.
20329,Homer,five days! but i'm mad now!
14047,Homer,"bart, why are you still up?"
32171,Homer,those are words.
25332,Homer,"comin' through... hey, hi otto... sorry..."
26678,Homer,so what? mr. burns is dead.
14489,Homer,"marge, dogs love the outdoors."
28526,Homer,"no need, flanders. i've already given them my old clothes."
31395,Homer,oh i'm sorry. we should exchange insurance information. i have none.
25431,Homer,"you're moving the team to albuquerque, aren't you?"
34824,Homer,"aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!"
20523,Homer,you could fake your own death...
13550,Homer,who are you?
22422,Homer,any of these will be fine.
29704,Homer,"i would, but marge would kill me... i mean ohh, right."
38059,Homer,"i don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
28692,Homer,just tell me how much of this is true!
32689,Homer,"what's the matter, son?"
31281,Homer,you always find an excuse not to make out.
33546,Homer,professor frink! help me figure this out!
27526,Homer,"oh, i love this song."
38189,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah. just remember, if your mother asks, i took you to a wine tasting."
27382,Homer,you should know. it is your favorite album.
14225,Homer,"let's see... bart, cart, dart, eeart... nope, can't see any problem with that. wow! i'll take that ring!"
33415,Homer,"oh, why would you bring me here?! it's like bringing richard nixon to the watergate! or kevin costner to waterworld!"
21715,Homer,the kid's gotta die.
22688,Homer,"oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. mr. no-belly... mr... hasn't-got-a-belly..."
16092,Homer,you take that back...
41463,Homer,"oh, hair. i'll love you when you're old and gray."
27527,Homer,"i was made for loving you, baby / you were made for loving me..."
40559,Homer,no!
31801,Homer,i also wreck bar mitzvahs!
38236,Homer,how fresh?
29634,Homer,"oh lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as i consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
26808,Homer,"that's it, boy! it's time for your bath!"
13918,Homer,stable? that sounds expensive.
39192,Homer,is it even cheating?
21015,Homer,"sorry, can't hear you, marge. i'm clapping."
27533,Homer,she went to lovejoy's temporary church. she's worried about her immortal soul.
22457,Homer,"hey, no problem."
39222,Homer,"spill it, marge. where have you been hiding the christmas money?"
33240,Homer,but we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
34636,Homer,what the--
25029,Homer,"well, look at that. but who called the police?"
22095,Homer,even during ramadan?
33155,Homer,"i know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, i'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."
28253,Homer,awww.
25025,Homer,"uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
15394,Homer,i could use a tv tray.
23260,Homer,ooo... pointless nostalgia.
24421,Homer,"more hashbrowns, sugar?"
41347,Homer,"she's right, it was all me!"
41154,Homer,marge!
26502,Homer,"hm, ""homer's odyssey."" is this about that mini-van i rented once?"
21380,Homer,"my daughter's at that egyptian dealy right now. she wanted to take a limo, but i made her take the bus."
31444,Homer,"attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love."
38087,Homer,"listen, you punks. if you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place."
32683,Homer,look at you! idiots!
17037,Homer,that depends. is there another way to get this job?
18244,Homer,shut up.
17345,Homer,"okay, little buddy, hop in!"
17980,Homer,"woo hoo! oh, marge, that's great news!"
40185,Homer,"get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
22713,Homer,it ate everybody.
15741,Homer,the other day i was so desperate for a beer i snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
26725,Homer,i'm just passionate -- like all us greeks.
26067,Homer,"oh, sorry."
32286,Homer,"hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be."
15060,Homer,"boy, when lisa comes in, i want you to make a big fuss over how she looks."
31705,Homer,"relax, baby. while you were dreaming of me and calling me ""james,"" i took care of everything."
29485,Homer,you're absolutely right! stop this ride!
36590,Homer,let automobile von bismarck give it a try.
31201,Homer,"yeah, put a leash on him, lady!"
26491,Homer,"oh, that is it! abraham j. simpson, you are never driving again!"
26710,Homer,"always drawing your old man, huh? you must think i'm the greatest dad in the world."
17405,Homer,"hmm, i saw that report you did on sasquatch. it was fair and evenhanded. i'll do it."
30596,Homer,"and marge, there are certain things i can do for you that no other friend can. special things."
17719,Homer,you're pregnant! we're gonna have to have a baby! all our financial plans are ruined. we're doomed! doomed i tells ya!
33419,Homer,really? sure.
29906,Homer,he is too! his truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. right now. right now. now. now. nnnnnnnnow. now.

13698,Homer,"you were swindled, my friend. twenty bucks. take it or leave it."
28900,Homer,dressing room? uh oh.
37708,Homer,one more ride?
28400,Homer,but how will i find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
22546,Homer,"wow. did you see that thing, marge? so powerful. so commanding. so forceful and raw. it didn't ask, it just took."
41451,Homer,"stay with me, marge, and i promise we'll travel the world... and perhaps outer space."
31387,Homer,lousy. i gotta go to vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
36037,Homer,i can do this... i can do this...
34547,Homer,now we're cookin' with wind!
40275,Homer,oh yeah? and where might that be? oh.
19477,Homer,"...i always just figured my wife was my soul mate. but if it's not marge, then who is it? where do i begin looking?"
15117,Homer,"show's over, shakespeare!"
24485,Homer,"don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. to finish off becky. then we'll have mommy back."
36093,Homer,"love?! your mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. because today i'm getting it autographed."
28047,Homer,i like to walk down the avenue / bust a move with disco stu...
39133,Homer,"oh, all right."
16934,Homer,woo hoo! what do i get?
23803,Homer,"i guess, or one of her friends."

37812,Homer,"hi maggie, if you could talk, i know you'd have a few choice words for me."
28591,Homer,"hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day."
18418,Homer,i got someone to cover for me.
36129,Homer,"not now, marge!"
30494,Homer,a leatherbuddy! there's no limit to what i can do with this.
15817,Homer,"the burgers are getting cold, guys. holy moly."
36007,Homer,fish out of water!
29518,Homer,the internet wasn't created for mockery. it was supposed to help researchers at different universities share data sets. it was!
32496,Homer,that's how they getcha!
36831,Homer,"you have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt..."
15758,Homer,"people stop! we can't give up our dental plan! lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
13418,Homer,"all right, what are you getting at?"
36391,Homer,but you said it so mean!
19237,Homer,don't you care about your son? this is more important than money!
41559,Homer,i just want a tentacle.
25819,Homer,good as new.

20288,Homer,"yeah, well lenny said it."
27390,Homer,"that's right, honey."
29373,Homer,"hey, what's that dealy?"
34353,Homer,"but marge, i thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage."
29706,Homer,is there any other kind?
15500,Homer,"oh, my little maggie, i may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants."
25443,Homer,let's see those double a baseball honchos ignore this.
22273,Homer,what's the hubub? did moe finally blow his brains out?
39921,Homer,y'ello.

23975,Homer,good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.
32577,Homer,how can i get my memory to work?
39493,Homer,lisa!
30725,Homer,"oh yeah?! you're going to that camp, 'cause i'm gonna drive you there."
15205,Homer,hey! then i could follow my dream. living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
35416,Homer,as long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
22991,Homer,"oh, right."
20325,Homer,mmm-hmm.
26306,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
23554,Homer,damn! could my life get any worse?!
14556,Homer,you're darryl strawberry.
18477,Homer,"wait a minute. there's one thing i don't understand. in all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
18351,Homer,"carpal tunnel syndrome? no. lumber lung? no. juggler's despair? no. achy-breaky pelvis? no. oh, i'm never gonna be disabled. i'm sick of being so healthy!"
31835,Homer,i'm your father now.

18340,Homer,nooo! nooo! nooo! nooo!
16037,Homer,"why? oh, right. the sideshow bob thing. sorry, boy."
21222,Homer,"you'll never silence me! i'm the last angry man, patterson! a crusader for the little guy!"
22107,Homer,"... and after moe's, we went to krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and i ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. and then apu gave the mayor lots of change for..."
27804,Homer,i'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.

19858,Homer,"hang on, son!"
15298,Homer,marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket.
32206,Homer,"sorry, lisa. can't change the future."
39422,Homer,...and i'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. the only reason i'm telling you this is i'm going to be leaving you.

36925,Homer,i happen to remember it just a little differently.
34850,Homer,all right!
38749,Homer,"okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
29005,Homer,"and yet, i've never been to me."
21869,Homer,"pretty good, huh?"
14548,Homer,and here it is.
19808,Homer,amen to that.
40743,Homer,simpson.
31693,Homer,"please, mr. burns, pretend you work for me. you can have the boy, just don't beat him. you can beat him, just don't leave marks."
16543,Homer,"you know, marge, for the first time in our marriage, i can finally look down my nose at you. you have a gambling problem."
24476,Homer,remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
39029,Homer,so... what kind of lunch do you pack?

23428,Homer,"sir, that is an insult! i challenge you... what?"
27709,Homer,"you're preaching to the choir, man."
23013,Homer,grrr. i'm gonna to maul you.

35785,Homer,"god, what a great game! and you too can be on the winning team, mr. mayor. the springfield nuclear team."
28750,Homer,...i'm taking you all out for pancakes!
14933,Homer,huh?
20538,Homer,sheesh! you're the most paranoid family i've ever been affiliated with.
20887,Homer,"you didn't have to tell it like it is, marge."
32297,Homer,"ooh, a trap door. what's down there? your meatball collection?"
20757,Homer,"honey, daddy's waiting for the detective."
23668,Homer,yeah. it looked just like that.

28761,Homer,i'm taking you all out for tacos!
17050,Homer,"huh? yeah, i was listening. very funny."
15885,Homer,"all right, brain, you don't like me and i don't like you. but let's just do this and i can get back to killing you with beer."
32499,Homer,more ribs for me?
33182,Homer,"oh, i'm afraid lenny's dead."
39367,Homer,"you know, i defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. they been through here yet?"
23351,Homer,"aww, she missed it."
29809,Homer,"sure, they're on top of the world. then there's a big riot scene. then i don't know, i usually doze off."
29236,Homer,"you know, black dracula is now a congressman from virginia."
18967,Homer,oldies?
37600,Homer,no one.
25194,Homer,"yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."
30353,Homer,the brakes are shot.
38584,Homer,a ghost!
19488,Homer,"alone! i'm alone! i'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
30547,Homer,"well, there's my x-ray vision, my fire breath... and i can get big laughs with tennis balls."
30008,Homer,"here you go, honey. sing this."
39998,Homer,all right. i suppose my work here is done.
31502,Homer,"uh, they went to star wars land and fought star wars."
20604,Homer,i like being thanked.
19702,Homer,"she smells sheet smells by the sheet store. wait, wait. lemme try it again."
35591,Homer,"i guess my life isn't so bad. with the help of my loving family, i even published my first book...and i've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
17549,Homer,keep sliding.
35773,Homer,"you know, you're kind of a downer."
24208,Homer,"good work, everyone. we're sure to be first in line for duff days."
33941,Homer,uh-oh.
26993,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
17689,Homer,i've got sand in my underpants.
37953,Homer,aka ni taishte burei da! yogore o yaburu!
34511,Homer,"hey man, you planted that!"

25773,Homer,"hey, what's the deal?"
40263,Homer,"all right, burnsie."
38018,Homer,"marge, that's a compact-only space!"
27426,Homer,"why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
32471,Homer,my implants feel itchy.
35359,Homer,wouldn't they be girls?
38096,Homer,"oh... i guess grampa's coming home with us. unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? the really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""

27590,Homer,"i'm challenging you, hawk. in front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it."
35071,Homer,"and if you do it, son, you'll get the same."
15367,Homer,"nooo! bart, don't you ever do that again. understand?"
38172,Homer,"honey, there's something i wanna show you."

20963,Homer,"hey, yeah."
26780,Homer,"let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy mrs. dash..."
26271,Homer,part of me knew that.
41067,Homer,i've changed my mind. i decided i don't want these shoes.
30432,Homer,"i'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. i hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us."
37395,Homer,"marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine oscar red carpet! there were some awesome dresses! and quite a few dis-as-ters."
28498,Homer,that's the birthday i'm always forgetting. i must have it!
19568,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. when are the pancakes coming in the mail?"

23039,Homer,sweet.
25144,Homer,so you all hate me?
21907,Homer,fine. i guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
39696,Homer,"this isn't gambling, marge. it's a lead pipe cinch."
21609,Homer,you stay here and guard the sandwich.
40052,Homer,"if i had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that."
31130,Homer,nine volt! double a! d!-d!-d!-d! cordless drill!
17068,Homer,"well let's just call 'em uh, ""mr. x"" and ""mrs. y."" so anyway, mr. x would say, 'marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't homer j. simpson.'"
36272,Homer,i said i've got it!
40764,Homer,ignoramus.
19892,Homer,"well, i don't think so. you don't even have a trigger on that thing."
34290,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
29413,Homer,"spill it, super-boss!"
35934,Homer,"now lisa, i'm an entertainer. and you can't entertain and inform at the same time. and if you're access hollywood, you do neither!"
25840,Homer,keep 'em comin'.
14331,Homer,"pfft, my heart is just fine."
33929,Homer,but you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
21243,Homer,fellow citizens! how would you rate the trash service in this town?
15218,Homer,"marge, marge, marge, let's file this under ""r"" for arrivederci."
17753,Homer,"well then, i have a back-up plan. see, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
34527,Homer,"hmm... alternative energy expo. where there's expos, there's free frisbees! let's roll. but we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out."
28825,Homer,"aw, it's no use, son. by the time i get out of here you'll be grown. turn around / turn around / turn around and you're a young man / and you're too big to choke."
15732,Homer,when i was 17 / i drank some very good beer / i drank some very good beer i purchased with a fake i.d. / my name was brian mcgee / i stayed up listening to queen
30680,Homer,"so, i infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
26813,Homer,"good night, maggie."
19532,Homer,we were sitting in barney's car eating packets of mustard. ya happy?
15572,Homer,"uh, oh."
16076,Homer,"marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. and unless movies and tv have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
22161,Homer,"hey, that's great."
27761,Homer,you're right. put two walnuts in there.
40005,Homer,sure.

32011,Homer,"rice krispie treats? way to phone it in, sarah wiggum!"
41238,Homer,"heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. well, off to the plant."
29540,Homer,it soaked through to the other side!
32424,Homer,"hazel! your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw i ate after we first made love."
23863,Homer,now who's the dean?
21872,Homer,"i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge. it chose me. i'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. now help me make up some phony credits."
23551,Homer,the cooling tank just blew and they're taking lenny to the hospital.
24430,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to represent myself. drunken hicks of the jury..."
26238,Homer,that's a great idea. do you think i could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
33683,Homer,how would i know?
23818,Homer,marc--
15796,Homer,god bless those pagans.
18508,Homer,"good night, son."
13294,Homer,len-ny.
34383,Homer,"hey, it floats!"
29932,Homer,"man, i'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. although to be honest, i did enjoy lying down."
13542,Homer,dog on fire! dog on fire!
23916,Homer,i'm drunk!
22775,Homer,"oh, poor eve. what are you doing out there in that horrible place?"
22309,Homer,"yeah, but there's two!"
15995,Homer,"meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own..."
20957,Homer,"five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
28462,Homer,"yes, you're right..."
31637,Homer,"this is it. it's taken all day, we've missed our flight to hawaii, but finally, i'll get my revenge."
15892,Homer,"mmmm, beer... what?"
40760,Homer,"debate? like, arguing?"
29554,Homer,"we now take you back through the ages, to a time before tv, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. the time of the bible!"
32728,Homer,pudding power activate!
37875,Homer,"where are my keys? oh, right here."

39968,Homer,"hello, this is mr... sampson."
14692,Homer,your wife don't understand you/ but i do...
13460,Homer,"yeah, probably. anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. and all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. so they got hercules, and hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave hercules this big thing of riches."
28754,Homer,pre-nursery school?!
37464,Homer,"come on, you know how dudes are. we don't go digging into the past. we talk about guy stuff."
38890,Homer,where are you taking me?
36906,Homer,goofing on it made me feel wise!
21171,Homer,"honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
27265,Homer,"hm, the water's off. i'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
15960,Homer,get off the stage!
34408,Homer,"i'm sorry. it's just that these tours are so exhausting. you're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
41315,Homer,food goes in here.
35638,Homer,hey.
16439,Homer,that's unsexy.
16265,Homer,where you going?
40182,Homer,wretch --

38284,Homer,"okay, okay. we'll make it fun. i'll take her to that crab place. all the crabs you could smash."
22040,Homer,"yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... i don't usually sign stuff like that."
16998,Homer,"maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
37090,Homer,"oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but i'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what i'm saying..."
37237,Homer,a little cream?
35115,Homer,the good doctor has just the prescription.
32196,Homer,but i can only sing lying on my back.

17629,Homer,peek-a-boo!
35573,Homer,"bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
19733,Homer,and that kind of stuff is worth money?
13184,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah!"
37016,Homer,how can that be? i took every last can of gas!
18068,Homer,"laser effects, mirrored balls. john williams must be rolling around in his grave."

33202,Homer,i want you to put it all on my little girl. and parlay with the asian kid.

21090,Homer,will you look at those morons? i paid my taxes over a year ago.
37191,Homer,i can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on tv.
23904,Homer,who are you?

21100,Homer,"c'mon, get in there. drop."
21465,Homer,"nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
19849,Homer,"at first i thought prohibition was a good thing. people were drinking more and having a lot more fun. but without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
41354,Homer,a million dollars -- now i'm really glad i didn't die!

25132,Homer,i am here to give hope to the least of you. because we all have a crayon up our nose. maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
34771,Homer,"don't fight it... that's it... that's it, a little more... how's that?"
38964,Homer,can i play?
34609,Homer,"you see, ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
16370,Homer,"marge, don't discourage the boy. weaseling out of things is important to learn. it's what separates us from the animals. except the weasel."
29286,Homer,"well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough."
25643,Homer,it's too late.
37888,Homer,"all right, movie, you better be worth it."
22397,Homer,"no, no, he can't be. i know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. yeah, that's gotta be it."

31857,Homer,wanna watch me?
15417,Homer,"goodnight, honey."
26292,Homer,"ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine."

27353,Homer,now what am i gonna get lisa?

30028,Homer,"everything i did, i did for you."

32927,Homer,i'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
25786,Homer,teamsters.
39205,Homer,who shall i say is calling?
34165,Homer,you... can't... do that...
39881,Homer,political what?
38298,Homer,"don't worry. i won't embarrass you. i will put my napkin in my lap. i will use the utensils provided for me. and if our food is slow in coming i will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the earl of yarborough."

29881,Homer,how did you know?
16558,Homer,"alright, these are our new family security rules: be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows."
41447,Homer,"eh, i think that's all of 'em."
15561,Homer,"ding-dong, the witch is dead."

28425,Homer,"don't worry, i'll find you someplace safe."
22587,Homer,"i'd like to read the following statement, but i do so under my own free will. it has come to my attention that nbc sucks. i apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many fox shows as possible. so in summary, nbc bad, fox good. cbs great."
13691,Homer,but the note was asking you to --
19610,Homer,oooh.
17818,Homer,what keeps doin' that?
32068,Homer,liberals -- i hate them so much!
28720,Homer,loveless loners are so lucky. there's no way i can afford to give marge a nice anniversary present.
27360,Homer,but it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- lisa simpson.
30269,Homer,"c'mon, marge. when are you gonna call?"
13256,Homer,nellllsonnnn...
31655,Homer,what's your hurry?
36288,Homer,i'm doomed!
40424,Homer,"oh, well, i'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. let's go."
17256,Homer,stuck-up riverdale punks. think they're too good for me.
17071,Homer,"so, little lisa, apple of my eye. how are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?"
19817,Homer,yeah! you do your own dirty work!

16032,Homer,aaah...
24615,Homer,"quiet, honey. daddy's asking the man a question."
38847,Homer,"ooh, spot!"
35550,Homer,death to america!
17511,Homer,"the last bar in springfield. if they don't let me in here, i'm gonna have to quit drinking."
24362,Homer,according to this you're both idiots.
27485,Homer,i think my leg is broken.
38147,Homer,"baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
30309,Homer,"okay. to save the manatees, i guess i could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
33827,Homer,i'll take it!
16536,Homer,marge! where are you?! damn this casino! damn this casino!
20806,Homer,"batman! / i mean, leader! i love the leader!"
37162,Homer,"sure, what do i care?"
26524,Homer,"sweet penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when i left."
24671,Homer,"but those olde springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like keith partridge."
29737,Homer,okay. i'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
21661,Homer,"well, that's it."
39094,Homer,"good. good. by which i mean bad, bad."
31664,Homer,that was me. some very un-cool people put me in here.
29834,Homer,"son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your mom."
29974,Homer,youth? i hate them. secondly...
19511,Homer,"well, it's one a.m. better go home and spend some quality time with the kids."
20322,Homer,"i don't have to be careful, i got a gun."
25393,Homer,"you're right, honey. hear that, kids? the simpsons are going to blockoland!"
29748,Homer,"no, i spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. i need a castle where i can be king!"
13764,Homer,what?
18395,Homer,pro: i'm drought and famine resistant.
38338,Homer,"no, no, no! don't pull me out before you click eject! that hurts like a mother--"
41379,Homer,...lisa simpson.
17053,Homer,okay. but then we've got to get to work.
20573,Homer,"oh, marge, don't let go, no matter what. if they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
34377,Homer,and the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
30229,Homer,"marge, you bring bart home now! once you go vatican, you can't go back again."
26359,Homer,yeah. homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
22878,Homer,marge! why does art hate me? i never did anything to art.
23070,Homer,it's worth every cent. i'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
28493,Homer,"doing pretty good so far. a key ring for marge, key ring for bart..."
32102,Homer,no way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! i flew on a private plane.
17440,Homer,"no. it's just that i've only seen this movie twice before, and i've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- what i meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. i promise."
36046,Homer,good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
16119,Homer,"exam?!? oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
29259,Homer,so that's what that white noise was.
21093,Homer,i have a to do pile?
33589,Homer,gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
31260,Homer,"now as i see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
34630,Homer,"well, marge and i don't have any problems. we never even fight anymore."
17804,Homer,"being a clown sucks. you get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. who am i clowning? i have no business being a clown. i'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
33184,Homer,y'ello!
20859,Homer,you don't look so rich.
37315,Homer,marge was so happy when i made those promises. what changed?
33309,Homer,i'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
25440,Homer,"i don't mind being called a liar when i'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. but not when i'm telling the truth."
18773,Homer,"um, what do i do in case of fire?"
28178,Homer,not this! anything but this!
31964,Homer,"we're not thieves, we're scavengers! like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or america's sweetheart, the maggot."
19905,Homer,mayday! mayday!
17477,Homer,"of course not marge, just for the rest of his life. he said i was an accident. he didn't want to have me!"
39257,Homer,"well, i was just on my way out to get one."
29213,Homer,"hmmm, i wonder if i could blow up heaven?"
25492,Homer,thank you.
18970,Homer,the us festival! geez! it was sponsored by that guy from apple computers.
40408,Homer,listen to 'em laughing... this is so humiliating... i'm never gonna live this down... damn flanders...
37697,Homer,"if you're my wife's secret lover, come in. there's nothing i can do for her anymore."
37098,Homer,"marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit."
33685,Homer,"pleased to meet you. uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but i have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that i can't help wondering about."
16841,Homer,"humph, your car. boy, what are the odds, huh?"
40317,Homer,"hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. i've become the center of attention."
28809,Homer,"okay kids, you can keep him."
40402,Homer,"come on, bart. remember what vince lombardi said: ""if you lose, you're out of the family."""
37377,Homer,"right, um, i don't understand, lisa, we let you get up early to watch the royal wedding!"
33754,Homer,"marge, where have you been?"
18191,Homer,"now wait a minute! okay, i'm not gonna win father of the year. in fact, i'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. wait, can i start again? fathering children is the best part of my day... i'd do anything for bart and lisa!"
21749,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. let's go home."
27254,Homer,"oh, yes! the tag chafed my throat! let's go eat some bugs."
36783,Homer,"dough, sauce, cheese, topping. dough, sauce, cheese, topping. dough, sauce, cheese, topping! having fun, maggie?"
14635,Homer,buffalo gals won't you come out tonight / come out tonight / come out tonight... oh buffalo gals...
32366,Homer,at your funeral.
21180,Homer,what do you want? his cholesterol's through the roof.
13304,Homer,go away.
31636,Homer,revenge!
36364,Homer,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! which he drops in the water!
27920,Homer,sweet.
24050,Homer,"oh, how rude of me. my name is..."
16599,Homer,oh sorry. i'm a little nervous.
28473,Homer,"hey, where's my car?"
24714,Homer,"marge, may i play devil's advocate for a moment?"
19021,Homer,what's with all the questions?
28763,Homer,"go, seminoles!"
15247,Homer,"great. oh, uh... and there was something else. something i was supposed to tiptoe around..."
39502,Homer,arrrgh!
29738,Homer,directory assistance?
41023,Homer,sort of.
39844,Homer,oooo.
37020,Homer,"you got to watch a vhs copy of ""red dawn"" thirteen times. stop complaining."
31091,Homer,and her?
35370,Homer,which is lucky for me because you're always right.
40181,Homer,ouch! censer..
22510,Homer,everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. see the problem's communication. too much communication.
36807,Homer,who do you think painted the word on the tree?
18731,Homer,you think so?
35069,Homer,"well in that case, lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so i opened the drapes to let in more sun."
18088,Homer,that's why it was so funny. but they're not.
13311,Homer,"it's true. now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, lisa. there's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. oh well, maybe i can't explain all this, but i can fix your doll house for you. at least, i'm good at monkey work. you know... monkey. you know what i mean?"
39713,Homer,"i can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?"
39078,Homer,"you know, maybe i shouldn't be here. i promised my wife i'd lose weight."
37292,Homer,give up? it's marge -- i'm having a lunch date with my wife.
38114,Homer,"all you gals like chicken dinners, marge."
37009,Homer,no! i want to help the people who didn't prepare!
17146,Homer,"huh, wha?"
22553,Homer,huh?
16339,Homer,i feel validated by that.
39288,Homer,"yeah, you're right. i guess whirlwind is our only hope for a merry christmas."
37492,Homer,forvitinn.
24718,Homer,for a casual acquaintance like you? absolutely.
24190,Homer,"check it out. there's island blackjack, island craps, island texas hold 'em... but if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. four sand dollars on number six, please."
20095,Homer,"new york is a hellhole, and you know how i feel about hellholes."
28202,Homer,gotta win a t-shirt. gotta win a t-shirt.
14786,Homer,"that's better. hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
20555,Homer,sounds like goood watchin'.
25304,Homer,uh-oh.
35463,Homer,little help...
40523,Homer,twenty million women in the world and i had to marry jane fonda.
36277,Homer,"aw, jeez."

17918,Homer,"hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. i'll be that carl reiner guy, you be what's his face."
34841,Homer,"well, if you check your purse i think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
29926,Homer,real.
29200,Homer,do me! do me!
20457,Homer,"well, if quitting is the best, maybe i should just quit my job."
28982,Homer,there's a first class?
21892,Homer,"your potato? you can't like own a potato, man. it's one of mother earth's creatures."
37388,Homer,what the--?
34339,Homer,"oh my god, i killed her!"
28179,Homer,uh... what was that first one again?
30814,Homer,i realized i could never find the gold without your help. so i made it this week's family outing.
25442,Homer,"so? i can stop. and i will stop. i'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
26406,Homer,what the hell is that?
16450,Homer,nooo!
16203,Homer,mmmm... forbidden donut.
37819,Homer,"all right, eighties party! where's the beef? tear down that wall! because i think the beef is behind that wall!"
14269,Homer,step aside! i'll deliver this baby!
23712,Homer,"can't hassle us, pig. we're goin' the speed limit. oink, oink, oink."
40044,Homer,hair... hair... just like everybody else.
17436,Homer,but listen to the music. he's evil!
20602,Homer,you're all nuts.
19869,Homer,huh?
24361,Homer,"okay. ""last question: who is your favorite backstreet boy?"""
39230,Homer,"oh. i love you, marge."
28992,Homer,"oh yeah, like people in new jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. it's on the freakin' state flag."
27651,Homer,droll.
33374,Homer,woo hoo!
32311,Homer,maggie! you did all this?!
20595,Homer,okay-bye-love-you.
25326,Homer,don't listen. it's a trick!
18200,Homer,i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now.
23154,Homer,"oh! mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage i've ever seen. and it's not easy for me to say that."
39061,Homer,"well, not maggie."
37017,Homer,"now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
25708,Homer,"okay guys, i've got a secret play i've been saving for the olympics or possibly the final four, and it goes something like this... uh, skinner i want you... moe, you can take ... homer, you can take groundskeeper willie. no way am i taking groundskeeper willie. yes you are. are you a team player or not?"

13372,Homer,"hmmm, bait."
19612,Homer,"yes, lotta hysteria..."
17247,Homer,i can't take this anymore. let's switch back.
14285,Homer,why you little... he did that on purpose!
28119,Homer,that's because there were seven apostles.
37217,Homer,who?
39393,Homer,"kill myself? killing myself is the last thing i'd ever do. now i have a purpose, a reason to live. i don't care who i have to face. i don't care who i have to fight. i will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."

41180,Homer,"hello, what's this?"
34257,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? it's date night."

32973,Homer,"now, are you gonna come quietly, or do i have to..."

13217,Homer,"yeah, yeah, i'll get right on it. now in order to aid your journey across the land, i offer you the guidance of my daughter, sacagawea. in our language, her name means ""little know-it-all who won't shut her maize hole."""
34437,Homer,celebrate your commonality. some of us don't eat pork. some of us don't eat shellfish. but all of us love chicken!
25530,Homer,woo hoo!
18701,Homer,"good morning, mr. burns. beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
39111,Homer,"it will never happen again. now come on, let's walk home."
39033,Homer,"wow. wow. between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. come on, give me a hug."
14195,Homer,you mean like will apes be our masters?
30199,Homer,"catholic school, eh...?"
17697,Homer,the next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
28518,Homer,"c'mon, death. leave mcgrew alone. take tiny tim."
36633,Homer,um... remember that corvette i had?
37724,Homer,so beautiful.
13467,Homer,marge! lisa! maggie! let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
18842,Homer,okay.
33596,Homer,uh-oh.
39299,Homer,"ah, forget it. let's go."
33314,Homer,and she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
37598,Homer,in a breaking and entering kind of way.
31475,Homer,"and i hate the cutesy way you make jack-o-lanterns! i like scary halloween, not funny halloween!"
33357,Homer,"great, thanks. listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?"
29733,Homer,my hemophilia!
34325,Homer,"hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
14646,Homer,or... to put it another way... there is.
38142,Homer,"well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
36308,Homer,gotta have that!
19393,Homer,i... what?
14247,Homer,"good evening, madame. you have been selected by the good people of slash-co to reap the benefits of their new nev-r-dull knife-edge. here... shake hands with the slash-co."
41253,Homer,"""you will find happiness with a new love."" oh, even the chinese are against me. what's the point. i can't fight fate."
37563,Homer,"now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag."
16566,Homer,"we don't need a thinker, we need a doer. someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
33127,Homer,"he's not talking, he's yelling!"
28470,Homer,"you can't leave, i'm your ride home!"
18385,Homer,"""to start, press any key."" where's the ""any"" key?"
24425,Homer,jimmy crack corn and i don't care / jimmy crack corn and i'm not there / we built this city on rock and rolllll / something something day.
29900,Homer,what's in the box?
30322,Homer,stupid best friend flanders.
38178,Homer,just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
30428,Homer,"david, you're by far the best son i've ever had. uh-oh."
18688,Homer,i wish i was sipowicz.
13799,Homer,"yeah, krusty, tell us."
35424,Homer,"uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
25433,Homer,wait a minute. will this erase my memory?
35950,Homer,"it was all a dream! oh marge, oscar madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!"
35227,Homer,hmm?
29579,Homer,"if that's true, he's gonna be like nwa -- not without ass-welts."
35849,Homer,"ooo, a b-mail!"
40061,Homer,"daddy's home, sugar!"
29606,Homer,"now to answer all the pop-ups. ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. that's only fair."
40686,Homer,wait! i can't call marge. it's our last day on earth together. i can't drag her into this mess. i know! i'll call barney.
32056,Homer,"well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. that makes us friends, right?"
14373,Homer,all right!
15382,Homer,it on a crooked '50's game show!
18000,Homer,ooh la la.
35246,Homer,"i'll be out here with you, dave."
14982,Homer,maarge... come to bed marge...
34555,Homer,"marge, how hard can it be? we're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. it's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a mexican prison."
28852,Homer,"two glasses of wine, moe."
14648,Homer,two tickets for...
15361,Homer,daddy.
29155,Homer,i'm not made of money! we'll swim to oakland.
32316,Homer,"wow, bart! lookin' good!"
28524,Homer,"marge, tv and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. from now on, i will stop being selfish and start being good. in fact, i'll be the nicest man in town."
35038,Homer,right... neither am i.
27246,Homer,"marge, i'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled."
32682,Homer,"really? you people are idiots! that's the dumb-- what a stu-- i mean, that sounds fair."
30162,Homer,"uh, i'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. it's called ""plops"" and..."
18562,Homer,"ooo! ""snappy answers to stupid questions""! i'm great at these. ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."
24971,Homer,there ya go! we'd be stealing from people we know. it's just like the seasons.
14948,Homer,"one size fits all, my butt!"
29312,Homer,"what's happened to us, marge? we used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. then came the heart attacks."
17353,Homer,hey! apu just called. this friday lisa's team is playing bart's team. you're in direct competition. and don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. i want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
21430,Homer,gotcha!
26701,Homer,woo hoo!
20139,Homer,"just a minute... everything's under control... yes, i'd be upset, too..."
15295,Homer,"if you're gonna get mad at me every time i do something stupid, then i guess i'll just have to stop doing stupid things."
13541,Homer,awww.
23255,Homer,"god bless you, nelson muntz."
29189,Homer,"oh, i can't stand seeing one of my children like this."
39233,Homer,well... i want to do the christmas shopping this year.
18854,Homer,"oh, diablo canyon 2... why can't you be more like diablo canyon 1?"
25400,Homer,"you know, standing up for the little guy felt good. i'm gonna do it more often."
29999,Homer,interesting. it's like a corndog without the dog.
18133,Homer,"this is the darkest day in the history of springfield. if anybody wants me, i'll be in the shower."
29969,Homer,"wow, he's just the kind of weirdo bart needs."
24575,Homer,"oh, that's all you got? huh? huh?"
23071,Homer,"oh, of course. you're right. you know, i read about a shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... run, bart!"
34519,Homer,i know just the guy.
29957,Homer,television at three o'clock.
22608,Homer,good ol' government.
25782,Homer,"why did you rat me out, kids? was it because i showered love on those other children while ignoring you?"
22828,Homer,oh yeah? prove it.
26612,Homer,"oh, thank god you're okay."
26462,Homer,"the ""x"" is for extreme!"
26463,Homer,who told you?!
22580,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna die! jesus, allah, buddha, i love you all!"
19183,Homer,"you know lucius sweet? he's one of the biggest names in boxing! he's exactly as rich and as famous as don king, and he looks just like him, too."
21248,Homer,and can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
33360,Homer,i'll just stick with my beer.
34391,Homer,after we see the stations of the omelet bar.
39191,Homer,stole? how is counting cards stealing?
27085,Homer,"like this, mr. kravitz?"
34668,Homer,it's like you're a chinese empress!
35470,Homer,"hey ned, can i borrow some hair?"
30020,Homer,"marge, lisa and i were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect."
22930,Homer,"of course not! ""nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""
14859,Homer,"all right, herb, i'll lend you the two thousand bucks. but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
23384,Homer,but i was gonna loot you a present!
22367,Homer,the game! we're so close!
37180,Homer,because we just bought them new shoes!
26911,Homer,exactly.
38010,Homer,...someone's actually working...
17874,Homer,let me see! let me see! out of the way!
39966,Homer,"it matters not, mon frere. and after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the off ramp inn."
22306,Homer,pfft. it wouldn't have made a difference.
13621,Homer,we're all gonna die!
20152,Homer,"ooh, a fresh batch of america balls! mmm..."
26182,Homer,stanford.
31583,Homer,the hell we are!
15410,Homer,where's the beef? no wonder he won minnesota.
21263,Homer,"see? we're still friends. c'mon, give us a cuddle."
33287,Homer,i'll save you!
27410,Homer,"well, all the childless drunks at moe's thought it was a great idea."
39740,Homer,ah... no.
21680,Homer,tell bart to come home!
33666,Homer,"that's ridiculous. who's your daddy, maggie? who's your daddy?"
36802,Homer,"hope is here, people, and it's real. it's not just inside the house of god, it's outside the house of me! so come and see the sticky brown truth!"
37289,Homer,it's amazing how much exercise i've gotten from those words.
35486,Homer,"wha? my doctor said ""don't walk."""
19765,Homer,homer storms out.
24752,Homer,read it!
30354,Homer,"learn to drive, boy!"
29099,Homer,we had just finished our first smooch. and i felt a feeling i'd never felt before:
33860,Homer,what movie?
40773,Homer,so... you wanna go out with me?
18956,Homer,"pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
40658,Homer,"does a father have to explain? let's just share your gift, okay?"
33079,Homer,"this looks like a job for captain crazy! up, up and away!"
33111,Homer,"well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you."
26456,Homer,you don't need that.
38741,Homer,"great practice, guys. what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
39516,Homer,"but what's a day off from work when i'm never gonna see my beloved son again. oh, bart. oh, bart."
37206,Homer,beefcake mags?
15341,Homer,"there's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
26531,Homer,burn this guy! he lost our good bucket!
40502,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna build you a spice rack!"
18002,Homer,"little lisa. lisa simpson. you know, i always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me."
14686,Homer,maybe. i'm not sure. i forgot it.
39306,Homer,"number eight. i mean, santa's little helper."
20245,Homer,"fine, then don't use it."
20515,Homer,"please. also, i think i'm getting a bedsore. what do you have to do to get turned around here?"
25171,Homer,oh.
32348,Homer,"now all i have to do is think of a clever line before i pull the trigger. oh, that's a perfect one. but i don't need to say it out loud, 'cause i'm by myself."
15904,Homer,yeah.
14456,Homer,let go!
34758,Homer,"...he had earned the nickname ""charlie hustle..."""
15199,Homer,uh huh?
20959,Homer,i have frozen myself so i may live to see the wonders of the future. thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. p.s. please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
17326,Homer,"ooo, how convenient."
26915,Homer,"from ""the woolly bully."""
15590,Homer,"that yentl puts the ""she"" in yeshiva."
20477,Homer,whoa...
23143,Homer,"a mini-van... oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. what is this? toyota previa?"
21356,Homer,at least i won't freeze to death.
24387,Homer,"oh, no, it's a lost child! don't worry, folks. i'll tackle him."
35350,Homer,"um, i take a special size."
15353,Homer,you mean...
19368,Homer,"oh, lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting springfield."
39795,Homer,bart! what are you doing?
19769,Homer,... as a father! a father!! a regular father!! whooh!
36023,Homer,"hm, the french have gotten into the wine game. good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
19342,Homer,"oh, i've just made things worse. a few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. marge deserves someone who will treat her right. marge deserves a fresh start."
23186,Homer,no.
38912,Homer,"no, please! all i'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!"
19799,Homer,"me too, son."
21845,Homer,"hmmm... she may not be famous, but she's right. those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. i did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... and i've still got a car full of their crap. crap, eh...?"
36889,Homer,and ca-lick!
18154,Homer,"kids! kids! kids! as far as daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
24932,Homer,attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
40703,Homer,love you. love you. love you.
20036,Homer,the car won't start. and i don't feel very good today. i am at work.
28026,Homer,"stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. i miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!"
23880,Homer,can't make a float without flowers.
38567,Homer,"no, boy. i want you to do it."
14679,Homer,uh-huh.
36741,Homer,"no, i don't want to."
28451,Homer,i'm your man!
21807,Homer,yes?
39360,Homer,"what is it, son?"
31482,Homer,but your mother smells like coconut!
34174,Homer,"goodbye, power plant. i'd better get out of here before i have a meltdown."
36726,Homer,now how would you qualify for that?
41482,Homer,"oh pilot, let's swing by... oh, heidelberg and drop in on oktoberfest."
35247,Homer,yes?
28180,Homer,"okay god, i bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. now release me from this ghastly vocation."
26989,Homer,anybody else?
19872,Homer,won't.
21912,Homer,"hi, marge. we're freaking out squares!"
32531,Homer,"maggie? has anyone seen anyone?! oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. without me!"
18061,Homer,mmmmmm.
20125,Homer,"but i can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. oh, why did i drink all that crab juice?"
16262,Homer,"what the... oh, i don't know... a little show called ""doctor quinn, medicine woman""?!"
34000,Homer,"now remember, no loud noises. oh man, that breeze feels good!"
23322,Homer,chewy! that's inspired.
32545,Homer,what did i do?
23842,Homer,"come on, loosen up. this is paradise."
28590,Homer,i can make a bike. i made you.
34607,Homer,"everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""
32264,Homer,"shut up! when you call in sick, who do you call?"
36512,Homer,"observe. hey, it's me again. he's there, isn't he? well, i hope this doesn't sound weird, but i'm inside your closet."
22645,Homer,"give it a try, honey."
38723,Homer,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the quebec nordiques became the colorado avalanche.
30738,Homer,"uh, but could you add a bacon nose? plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
21290,Homer,"yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. you're blocking the food."
28607,Homer,"woo hoo! i mean, beep beep!"
19361,Homer,woo hoo! two dollars! it's working!
31900,Homer,i can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
34763,Homer,"ridin' high! sinkin' low! top of the heap! down i go! on top for good! oh, cruel hubris!"
38279,Homer,she can smash a salad.
13681,Homer,"yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
35759,Homer,you switched the drives?
27787,Homer,ow! ow! he bit me! you saw him! he bit me! you little...
29227,Homer,there's a whole rack of 'em over there. i only ate two.
19727,Homer,what happened?
21491,Homer,"yeah, the british tabloids will have a field day. there's only one thing left to do."
31907,Homer,"it's like our honeymoon all over again. aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
33087,Homer,nobody shuts out my blather!
17008,Homer,"if he marries your mother, marge, we'll be brother and sister! and then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
33276,Homer,"just lis-ten! i'm grinding them now! ow! my finger! ooh, here comes the ambulance! my, you're a handsome fellow. just get in the ambulance, mr. simpson. we'll see to your finger. why thank you."
21137,Homer,is that a fish?
39450,Homer,"well, you picked a perfect time to start."
22131,Homer,what? there's nothing to worry about.
40264,Homer,c'mon! all we need is a grand slam.
38210,Homer,i'm so glad i was forced to come.
24917,Homer,did you bring us here?
24881,Homer,i've been sittin' on the toilet / all the live-long day...
30931,Homer,"yeah, well while i'm gone, you'll do what he says."
26840,Homer,woo hoo! he's alive. now you can't punish me.
22145,Homer,"that guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
17098,Homer,"bye, moe!"
14002,Homer,huh?
20532,Homer,"gods, eh?"
18090,Homer,"are you kidding? being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for marge, god forbid; and i can run background checks on whomever i want mohammar--"
20713,Homer,do do do do do...
21561,Homer,"marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for lenny."
35574,Homer,"marge, my ice cream's melting and i haven't finished my brownie!"
18062,Homer,"lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, i recommend getting a tattoo. it preserves the things you love."
22913,Homer,i'llgetit.
15080,Homer,"well, i need something for my son's birthday."
34986,Homer,what are we doing here?
37353,Homer,what size batteries.
29670,Homer,"son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters."
29581,Homer,follow instructions? he's doomed!
32446,Homer,old one?! they're convincing marge to dump me!
18220,Homer,i got it! madman moe's pressure cooker!
41532,Homer,none of your business. now give me a job at your business.
32086,Homer,drive to chicago? i don't have time for that. i have to be back at work on monday. and my boss is a total jerk.
16085,Homer,"in there, guys."
18449,Homer,"listen here. my name is homer j. simpson. you guys think i'm dead, but i'm not. now i want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."

33396,Homer,"i got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!"
28339,Homer,"my lord, we americans love queens, be they homecoming or dairy. this woman, however, is an imposter."
17087,Homer,why didn't i take a picture? i had ten years to take a picture.
16344,Homer,"i just thought i'd remind everybody. after all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
31241,Homer,"marge, the coast is clear."
15327,Homer,"flanders, i thought i was your plow man."
22264,Homer,"because, i loved them once and they broke my heart. let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
36763,Homer,oh yeah!

27676,Homer,stained with the blood of american patriots.
34108,Homer,holy moly!
22634,Homer,"you're on! lisa, you play winner."
20715,Homer,"sorry, son. daddy failed."
19526,Homer,the alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like urkel! and he appears every friday night -- like urkel!
18469,Homer,"hey, mom, lookit me! look at what i can do!"

40643,Homer,"eleven-thirty! oh, that's just great."
38084,Homer,"marge, teens can't control their urges. it's why there's never been a teenage president."
25678,Homer,what? that doesn't sound like me.

40911,Homer,"marge, honey, i've got five words to say to you. greasy joe's bottomless bar-b-q pit."

32923,Homer,"mom, we didn't know each other very well. if we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. but even when you weren't around, i always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
22789,Homer,"ooh, i smell barbecue!"
20900,Homer,he thought he was gonna steal--
27778,Homer,"yes, yes. if i keep putting work first, i'll lose everyone i care about, just like you did."

28002,Homer,that monkey's wearin' a hat.
28549,Homer,"um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?"

25008,Homer,you're right. we'd better just take this check back for shredding.
27907,Homer,"hey, mister? if you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? it's already rewound."
25290,Homer,"hey, bart. yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
17173,Homer,i mean hello!
33889,Homer,why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
21673,Homer,i rolled up all the socks.
21921,Homer,b-b-but the poncho...
35106,Homer,stupid double snuggler's hitch! only hope is to chew off my leg.
41189,Homer,"tomorrow... ugh; oh, marge, i'd love to, but i was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching t.v... spending some time with the boy. spending time with the boy. the boy needs attention, marge."
38125,Homer,we've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
36865,Homer,they can goatee... hell!
26278,Homer,eww. i touched it. over.
33522,Homer,never! hooray for stupid flanders!
29546,Homer,i don't know. it's a lot of pressure. do many people watch the super bowl?
25150,Homer,"hey, don't blame me. this movie is tired and predictable. you know she's gonna wind up marrying richard gere."
36433,Homer,"actually, i was supposed to be back last week. we'll just wait for the call from human resources."
19053,Homer,the beer!
32792,Homer,"homer simpson. i know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. and i'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we americans come together."
13913,Homer,sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
38784,Homer,tight as a drum.
40482,Homer,bart? bart?
14283,Homer,"hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
20075,Homer,that's not so disciplined.
14087,Homer,"business, eh? well let me tell you something. you just lost yourself a customer!"
29695,Homer,i'm a nuclear--
30704,Homer,i drew this picture of you.
33512,Homer,"well, i guess we can take a quick walk. we'll keep grampa occupied with this dvd of dwight eisenhower talking about golf."
26541,Homer,which phone company? there are hundreds of them. and they all keep changing their names.
15428,Homer,"ooh, oatmeal. what a delightful treat. ugh, there's a bug in it."
31440,Homer,"sweetie, i can't abandon my route even for one day. if those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, i am screwed. but i'll be back in time for your show."
14733,Homer,right...
18074,Homer,no marge!!
37930,Homer,"you know what, judge apatow... i do have something to say. these movie people may say i'm a pirate. but i'm just a man. a man who loved hollywood too much. so i made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
13571,Homer,pancakes... football... boobies...
41052,Homer,"look at that get-up. heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... assassins!"
38388,Homer,be that as it may
21530,Homer,"hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
19960,Homer,"oh, i'd love to go with you, honey, but i've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
38620,Homer,everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr. burns gets five thousand dollars!
25130,Homer,"hey, flanders, headin' for church? well, i thought i could save you a little time."
25872,Homer,i'll medicate you...
32803,Homer,later.
23592,Homer,"lisa, i know what's going on here. they did it to jesus and now they're doing it to me."
36189,Homer,what do i do?
36020,Homer,"almost there, boy. almost there. almost there."
25152,Homer,is there no place for the man with a 105 iq?
13527,Homer,"marge, i can't wear a pink shirt to work. everybody wears white shirts. i'm not popular enough to be different."
41127,Homer,but you could lose everything. come on.
22935,Homer,"could we, marge? could we get a horse?"
29408,Homer,act like burns!
31784,Homer,her name is marge.
32810,Homer,"oh, i see. it's reverse psychology. well in that case i'm not going and i'm not staying. and i'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling."
37034,Homer,now to sleep the sleep of the just.
20108,Homer,i'm on to you!
19460,Homer,"that's it? well, that's marge. big deal. great spiritual quest, wolfie. my soul mate is marge."
13140,Homer,underprivileged? you pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?
27066,Homer,"hey, what's this suitcase for? are we going on a trip?"
26881,Homer,"y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
24420,Homer,woo hoo!
14120,Homer,that'd be great.
24055,Homer,"hey, t-shirt- t-shirt-t-shirt!"
25162,Homer,we were what what in a what what?
15059,Homer,hey there blimpy boy flying through the sky so fancy free --
14805,Homer,"lamentably, no. my gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
18877,Homer,"yes, that's a real pickle. would you excuse me for a moment?"
36256,Homer,wait a minute...
25701,Homer,"ooo, ned, look who's here. it's that girl you don't like... not!"
21287,Homer,what? they had a picnic last week.
16603,Homer,hey!
39164,Homer,this is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches tv!
15903,Homer,your daddy hit the referee.
22689,Homer,"huh? oh, right. the steak."
29656,Homer,i won't do it.
26236,Homer,"ooh, here's a good one: the world's most overrated saint."
23568,Homer,"thank you! thank you! but there was someone else with me on that alley. i'm talkin' about the big man, carl."
28576,Homer,great. let's dump these kids in an r-rated movie while we go someplace nice.
34852,Homer,look what maggie got!
38490,Homer,jebus loves tebow.
33660,Homer,"i will, when it's not sports season. i just want to know how the game ends."
17628,Homer,wow. mental note. don't overdo this.
14249,Homer,i quit! i quit!
29669,Homer,i just don't understand what the problem is.
40279,Homer,me? in the majors?
26360,Homer,i didn't sell her. i just rented her to an old boyfriend.
30572,Homer,"hey, good looking. wanna snuggle with ""tyrannosaurus sex""?"
35182,Homer,"thank you for the tour of your factory, mister wonka."
38577,Homer,he is me!
37244,Homer,"yeah, it's medicinal. we had a pain in our neck."
22445,Homer,"no way, this guy's a winner. he has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... anyway, you wouldn't understand."
14671,Homer,"ew, a skunk!"
41539,Homer,hm... i wonder what's on your mind...
24707,Homer,"just a second, honey. daddy's on his high horse."
41286,Homer,"you have to think, it's your job."
32300,Homer,is louie keeping you prisoner here?
17019,Homer,ew yuuuuck!

40801,Homer,"hey, barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?"
20179,Homer,"aw, lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
30033,Homer,someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
30069,Homer,"no, thank you."
30935,Homer,woo hoo!
13934,Homer,no! no!
16606,Homer,he's a burglar.
22931,Homer,a hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. a hundred and thirty-five springs...
16311,Homer,yeah. what's the deal?
17932,Homer,"i didn't do it for them. i did it for you, marge. i'd kill for you. please ask me to kill for you."
26030,Homer,it's the law. my hands are tied.
15745,Homer,"marge, i'm going to moe's. send the kids to the neighbors, i'm comin' back loaded."
15608,Homer,"hey, boy. how was soccer practice?"
40251,Homer,"thanks, everybody."
37460,Homer,"guys, i think we might need a new song. four best friends who ne-ver quar-rel"
31843,Homer,foul on twenty-three!
33134,Homer,marge?!
35198,Homer,i've failed as a parent. i swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. to the media room!
13793,Homer,what are you talking about? of course he does.
32976,Homer,"this case is ""in the bag."""
37543,Homer,"marge, i threw my back out. can you please refill this prescription right away?"
37152,Homer,"finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles."
19385,Homer,"eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
29059,Homer,but i promised my daughter--
28853,Homer,"all good points. sleep tight, my drunken angel."
38188,Homer,i wish i knew how.
14739,Homer,yes i am.
26893,Homer,you know what will cool this place down? a little touch of winter.
19131,Homer,uh-huh.
39421,Homer,"friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. you have to learn that there's a little homer simpson in all of us."
21104,Homer,"no, sir. i'm really sorry sir. an older boy told me to do it."
36302,Homer,watch whatever you want -- i got you here alive. now i'm gonna visit the only court i could never be in contempt of: food court.
40777,Homer,what?
35796,Homer,my work is so meaningless.
34087,Homer,start the ride!
33225,Homer,wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
39891,Homer,none of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
30108,Homer,stupid family... won't even come to my rapture... i went to lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
38836,Homer,hm?
20583,Homer,i went yesterday.
34946,Homer,since when is all this against the law?
24920,Homer,sorry.
27358,Homer,"well, yes and no."
14741,Homer,"lurleen, they loved you."
15168,Homer,hmm...
29792,Homer,but he misread my pee! he misread my peeeee!
20484,Homer,then just tell her you're already married.
15923,Homer,"apu, i'd like you to drop the charges against my wife."
20083,Homer,"uh, yeah. i've always said the boy could use more confidence."
18241,Homer,"out of the way, you."
18324,Homer,"ow! watch it, coney."
15756,Homer,thanks a lot carl. now i've lost my train of thought.
28724,Homer,"coke and pepsi are the same thing! wake up, people!"
17623,Homer,please don't kick me out! this society is everything to me! please give me another chance! i've learned my lesson.
19717,Homer,no i am not.
34507,Homer,"well, if you really want me to stay..."
23745,Homer,"you and me, chopper to chopper."
34273,Homer,"sweep! sweep! left, right! left, right! back-and-forth!"
17812,Homer,"well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
24415,Homer,"rise and shine, everybody."
37487,Homer,put the noodles in the shed. there isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
34795,Homer,bankers away!
24034,Homer,"marge, now!"
27857,Homer,it's a cinch these guys never had any kids.
35392,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. all day long i have to listen to women talk."
35356,Homer,"well, if you insist."
28168,Homer,what? it's not... my hand! what's happening?
40654,Homer,"oh, why you little --"
28833,Homer,"hey, my car insurance expired. quite a while ago."
36834,Homer,please. please rush into this! please rush into this!
38205,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
30873,Homer,my collection is complete. forty years of the family circus.
38025,Homer,i guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what i know... and how i know.
22136,Homer,do you have a table for the mayor?
24591,Homer,"badger, my ass. it's probably milhouse."
32582,Homer,"goodbye, cruel world."
20374,Homer,"i put it in a safe place, marge. i mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
37251,Homer,"thanks, flanders. punch my eye, destroy my marriage. now just pull the plug and let me die."
20135,Homer,it's gonna be dark soon. i'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
26958,Homer,i must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
36966,Homer,sweet.
35571,Homer,"marge, i parented!"
15264,Homer,woo hoo!
26770,Homer,"dirty love. i mean, thirty love. i mean, anyone for penis? i'll just get the shuttlecock."
19045,Homer,"hey, he looks just like you, poindexter!"
27911,Homer,don't yell at ned!
20307,Homer,woo hoo!
25159,Homer,dee-fense! dee-fense!
26025,Homer,i told them it was a benefit. they think they're saving the rainforest.
38945,Homer,yes you are.
38562,Homer,"oh, that's fine then."
34125,Homer,wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
17432,Homer,you're both right.
23103,Homer,but i like the nice things you said about me.
28615,Homer,oh no! my recurring nightmare is coming true!
35631,Homer,"do you know what i just learned? my job is the reason i get those checks every week! and now that i'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! not in physical size, but--"
36015,Homer,"we show girls love on valentine's day, and they let us blow stuff up on the fourth of july. i just pray they never fall on the same day."
31657,Homer,"hold on there, boy. if you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."
14459,Homer,"go to sleep and goodnight/ da da da / da da da da da da da da/ dee dee dee / dee dee / may your christmas day be nice. goodnight, my little pork chop."
19303,Homer,whaaaaaat?!
25044,Homer,"wait a minute. you're telling me the police force, the tv news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and bart a lesson?"
37926,Homer,"have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
14169,Homer,"i'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
27465,Homer,"listen, my bulky flower, i-i have an early day..."
23682,Homer,don't worry. i brought some chloroform.
31084,Homer,do you know what you just gave up?!
16816,Homer,"aw, uncle homer. ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, i want you to get to know my family."
20754,Homer,you can't do this to me. what about the carny code?
34075,Homer,"now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm."
36309,Homer,lovin' it!
18380,Homer,i'm looking for something loose and billowy. something comfortable for my first day of work.
17027,Homer,how come you're not laughing? do you think i'm slow?
23336,Homer,"oh, lisa... you saved me! and after all the bad things i said about you."
24579,Homer,"... two krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan."
26586,Homer,does that include tip?
16915,Homer,i'll just keep these then.
24305,Homer,"well, forget it, guys. i am not barney!"
35702,Homer,"ouch, this place is fancy."
30009,Homer,"much of the tune is plagiarized. now go, go, go!"
26711,Homer,lousy minor setback! this world sucks!
25859,Homer,i'll bring the car around.
22362,Homer,football!
24245,Homer,...and only then do we find out that professor gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over international perfume and wine.
20978,Homer,everybody hates birds! ...right!
22818,Homer,"come on, you..."
28757,Homer,which one? tri-city? omni-pay? insta-threat? i've beaten 'em all!
20396,Homer,"the joke's on you, buddy. there's no bullets in that thing."
40915,Homer,"oh and that sauce, barney. i could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! no barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
25522,Homer,so all her bullying was just to get some attention.
13892,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah."
39242,Homer,"what's with the crazy getup, barn?"
34592,Homer,mmm.
20741,Homer,no. he's bart.
39614,Homer,"don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? i don't want to go away empty-handed, bob."
26389,Homer,"i gotta hand it to artie ziff, marge. that little nerd saved my life."
36942,Homer,"sorry, mrs. simpson."
19066,Homer,"right. bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
19468,Homer,"hi, kids."
18952,Homer,no on 24! no on 24! no on 24! no - on - twen - ty - four!
23035,Homer,"i know, sir. i'm sorry, sir."
14162,Homer,wow. chocolate -- half price!
23543,Homer,"heh, heh. i'd hate to see the look on ol' burnsie's face if he knew i was just gettin' in. hee hee."
23079,Homer,all hail emperor clobbersaurus!
39144,Homer,"babysitting, eh? what do i know about kids?"
37301,Homer,uh-oh.
36434,Homer,"well, i better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy."
23288,Homer,"can ya believe it, marge? this job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!"
41571,Homer,but i need it...
14756,Homer,i am not.
17380,Homer,"now, this is going to take all my skill."
21985,Homer,wooo!!
27710,Homer,"uh, well, i drew it on... see..."
13341,Homer,"bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
32275,Homer,"...which i previously alluded... are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?"
31102,Homer,don't start the exhibit without me!
31787,Homer,your hip hop cd was boastful and unnecessary!
16492,Homer,"well, maybe i want to. but then i think about marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. sometimes i'd just like to..."
16846,Homer,"neddie, neddie... let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
30147,Homer,yes.
22578,Homer,"oh, thank you, god. and thank you porta-john. you really saved my..."
28943,Homer,"okay, just repeat after me. ""edna, i made a huge mistake and i want you back."""
29622,Homer,lemme get my belt sander. maybe i can grind the ugly off your face.
18124,Homer,"now, marge, you can't blame all of bart's problems on your one little speech. if anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. and let's not forget your little speech..."
40884,Homer,huh? what the? i know you -- come back here...
28417,Homer,is this thing hurting you?
23420,Homer,i demand satisfaction! i challenge you to a duel.
35885,Homer,never putting me next to a pretty girl...
17142,Homer,and you didn't think i'd make any money. i found a dollar while i was waiting for the bus.
23839,Homer,electric needle room?!
33582,Homer,"oh dad, i never knew you had dreams, or emotions."
15140,Homer,"but marge, look at that hangdog expression. he's learned his lesson. let's get him a present."
39407,Homer,privately?
17551,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not here to take a reading test. i wanna see some credentials."
39636,Homer,"well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
29675,Homer,"great, another job lost to a foreigner."
27141,Homer,"i can't take any more of these shows. if i wanted reality, i'd finally have this lump looked at."
40228,Homer,"bad dog! bad neighbor dog! here, let me help you up, mr. burns."
33668,Homer,look marge! it's just what you want. me spending the day with muggsy.
16734,Homer,"good. listen, i'm sick of your boring space launches. now i'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but i know what i likes on tv..."
24461,Homer,shh! this plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
36191,Homer,ski patrol! everyone be cool!
35436,Homer,"really, duff blimp? you really want me to?"
25804,Homer,"raise your arm... okay, the other one..."
36119,Homer,what?
36102,Homer,"wait one sec, marge. before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
13450,Homer,how many hairs on my head? without looking!
21681,Homer,who's nelson?
16347,Homer,this is great. i can finally look like i want and not get hassled by the man.
40057,Homer,"good morning, springfield! good morning, mr. and mrs. winfield!"
33453,Homer,"marge, are you mad i forgot to send in the payment?"
25238,Homer,and i'll have the beef wellington.
38229,Homer,"here you go, honey."
25962,Homer,"yes. eventually, i became king of the morlocks."
15443,Homer,stop. please stop.
38635,Homer,gravy thursday.
25068,Homer,bring me my ranch-dressing hose.
36592,Homer,"so, you're not totally unqualified."
40131,Homer,huh? well... it's all ours!
25839,Homer,what's my blood alcohol?
19355,Homer,"hey, what's this thing?"
15107,Homer,but the car is okay?
32697,Homer,"hello, you've reached the snug bug. what do you mean my car's ready?! well you can keep it, 'cause i'm never giving up this one. now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love."
34978,Homer,please! let me have it! come on! give it to me right in the mouth!
39831,Homer,how's your mom?
25734,Homer,"sure, knock yourselves out, and call me homer."
18968,Homer,"but you've got all the top bands in here. styx? i just heard them on ""the king biscuit flour hour."" now here are some of your no-name bands: sonic youth, nine inch nails, hullabalooza..."
25968,Homer,maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
40243,Homer,"marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
16343,Homer,"well, here we are at the brad goodman lecture."
28674,Homer,woo hoo! i'm half-way through!
35660,Homer,"and we're in hall d. three halls, three minutes..."
19187,Homer,"oh, why me?"
39828,Homer,"i don't really know, sir."
35190,Homer,"walther, let's not be so hasty. who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? besides, our generation's got everything under control! now, if you'll excuse me, i was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. to moe's!"
27281,Homer,"hmm... well, there's mr. burns, fat tony, the emperor of japan, ex-president bush."
18357,Homer,"yes, sweetheart?"
40932,Homer,excellent.
23127,Homer,"oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. i'll bet you would've hated it if me and lenny were mr. smith."
35552,Homer,what will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
18869,Homer,ummm... do you have a crush on anyone?
34575,Homer,i'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! get in!
29901,Homer,of course we are! if you wanna be.
24487,Homer,"oh, about that. uh -- when i changed your oil, i may have drained your brake fluid. i didn't say anything 'cause i thought you'd be mad."
39153,Homer,"well, i'm mad i'm not doing it."
38656,Homer,"yeah! hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?"
26832,Homer,finish the job.
17209,Homer,"lobster hat... fishnet speedo, jr... wheelie shoes... invisible dog leash. well, i'm packed."
13613,Homer,where do you think? this baby never steers you wrong. and it was free. free!
34482,Homer,from fast food to fine dining?
26081,Homer,"um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"
29171,Homer,or that lady who wheels larry flynt around!
14132,Homer,you heard?
21055,Homer,me?
25901,Homer,"oh, i just got comfortable. use the bottle."
27760,Homer,"now, open it again and put a walnut in there."
31280,Homer,"hey, that's great. let's look at it after."
32078,Homer,"okay. what i was going to say, was..."
34931,Homer,now nothing stands between us and sunny hawa...
30583,Homer,i bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
16264,Homer,when will you be home?
37467,Homer,he's looking at a geyser! and there's a sign in front of it!
31891,Homer,what's wrong with it?
24020,Homer,but you're respected athletes! you own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
33542,Homer,a boat!
23105,Homer,what kind a mint?
17587,Homer,i felt so left out.
35460,Homer,awww...
35718,Homer,i've waited my whole life to hear that!
21588,Homer,"ohh, that's where you're wrong, marge. he was a shameless self-promoter."
38368,Homer,"thanks, moe, i... huh. must've left my wallet at home."
22230,Homer,"wait a minute. this could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. we would remember if we got married."
16859,Homer,"son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. it's how drunk you get."
19037,Homer,"bye-bye, job."
15279,Homer,ohh.
38882,Homer,"'tis a far, far better thing i do than i have ever done before."
34062,Homer,"allo, you are getting cozy with sarkozy."
23861,Homer,"oh, real original. who did this?"
31272,Homer,"sure, i'll tell them the truth..."
20223,Homer,"well, i admit it looks bad, flanders, but haven't you heard of ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
30434,Homer,"david feels, and your mother will agree when i tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it."
21742,Homer,"is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
16717,Homer,"i'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. everyone listens to me! no matter how dumb my suggestions are."
16551,Homer,"eh, that's no big loss."
31325,Homer,go on.
36484,Homer,what's wrong with her?
15387,Homer,"all right, you win round seven."
16652,Homer,woo hoo! cheap meat!
15238,Homer,"homer, you're not listening!"
35647,Homer,"i won't say, but his initials are s.f."
26177,Homer,"i'm good for the rest, you know i am."
15033,Homer,a ride on the duff blimp...
14568,Homer,one thing i'm good at and i can't do it anymore.
30034,Homer,ha! smart move. soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. after i make my new client a star.
15546,Homer,i'm trying my best.
41301,Homer,"there he is. the fat, pathetic slob i'd be with four kids."
29937,Homer,that's a given! there's something else. something much more else.
38715,Homer,we got a new tent from a guy who o.d.'d!
31052,Homer,now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
30188,Homer,i am a little pudgy. you got me. yeah.
16312,Homer,and i can just haul it away? free?
34787,Homer,come 'n' get it barnacles!
14080,Homer,you're my kid's teacher!
19698,Homer,"oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? not ""in-your-face,"" huh? well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!"
36610,Homer,"i, uh, hope it's twins!"
30502,Homer,"""happy birthday dad, from lisa."""
34765,Homer,"yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
36175,Homer,"thanks, guys. tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of mars except for the poles."
18348,Homer,hello.
27207,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
33593,Homer,"hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? how about you, greensleeves? irishmen love to get drunk."
19072,Homer,oh my god... space aliens! don't eat me! i have a wife and kids! eat them!
25043,Homer,i can't believe everyone was in on it.
20006,Homer,check.
19431,Homer,"well, chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
19670,Homer,okay. question two -- who was your last employer?
28029,Homer,"no. from now on, walking is my beer. and feeling good is my hangover."
15017,Homer,"fire! what do i do? what do i do? oh, the song! the song! when a fire starts to burn / there's a lesson you must learn / something... something, then you'll see/you'll avoid catastrophe!"
38427,Homer,yeah. nothin-- nothing's going on.
13974,Homer,"oh sure, great idea. i'd love to -- did you hear that?"
41521,Homer,tell that to the brave crew of the s.s. triangle.
34186,Homer,"""today is your lucky day."" yeah, pfft!"
39175,Homer,oh boy oh boy.
20572,Homer,"oh angel, listen not to this child of satan."
31974,Homer,betcha can't solve our maze? i didn't come here to be insulted. we're leaving!
28684,Homer,what are you talking about?
40751,Homer,"thanks, pop."
27324,Homer,bart! turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
22189,Homer,"one day soon i will come for you, and then the game will begin. could be in the middle of the night. it could be when you least expect it. or whatever's good for you. i don't care."
22212,Homer,"let's see... what's marge's birthday? barney is july fifteenth, same as lassie's, so marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. flanders, what's your birthday?"
37109,Homer,those better be good breaks.
15042,Homer,"heh heh heh... oh, lisa, this isn't real. it's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
18983,Homer,"oh, my homemade kahlua."
20172,Homer,"mister, we could use a man like sheriff lobo again."
36343,Homer,oh that's such a first-take answer!
16928,Homer,i'm alive! i'm alive. and i owe it all to this feisty feline.
23050,Homer,"no, no japan. jamaica! i wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side."
22135,Homer,"uh, excuse me..."
28335,Homer,your majesty?
24052,Homer,finally!
31587,Homer,then when all seemed lost...
35003,Homer,"oh. well, uh... you wouldn't like it. it's not very good."
41187,Homer,"now, go get 'em."
15708,Homer,"hey, barney. i think you've had enough."
33170,Homer,lemonade!
38564,Homer,nooo!
17183,Homer,go to hell!
36813,Homer,old man... i'm not an old man... this drawing doesn't think i'm old.
29369,Homer,"lisa, basic cable said i should nurture you."
33605,Homer,people can't smoke indoors in ireland!
20961,Homer,that makes 22 to 16.
18692,Homer,"boy, marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
15030,Homer,i can't wait that long.
27168,Homer,let's hear it.
26537,Homer,now that's what i call a moon shot.
23935,Homer,but i need that beer now.
38432,Homer,"i'm sorry she rejected your ""i'm sorry,"" cake, but in a way, i'm not. i guess what i'm trying to say is i like cake."
29039,Homer,"no trap can hold homer simpson! but i'm not homer simpson. i'm the pie man. homer simpson away! i mean, the pie man!"
36641,Homer,i don't recall that.
34518,Homer,"no, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. your awesomeness is real."
23425,Homer,huh?
41296,Homer,...until she changes her mind.
41185,Homer,"just a popularity contest?! excuse me, what's more important than popularity? now, bart, do you really think you can win?"
13221,Homer,"well, let's just say i hate crime."
17625,Homer,oh. sorry.
39446,Homer,you remember the rules from last year?
37363,Homer,the brain is so stupid.
14729,Homer,"hey! oh, you meant that as a compliment. now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. maybe we should give them something new."
14878,Homer,stupid roller-skate.
33173,Homer,"fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! i'm going to moe's, for beer! have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!"
18792,Homer,yello?... it's for you.
36879,Homer,"okay, you win. we don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? like those eels that eat whale poop?"
36822,Homer,"no, no, nothing, nope."
25577,Homer,"okay, here's the situation: we're hopelessly lost and about to die."
15787,Homer,by the big cooling tower...
30569,Homer,"you're like all easter bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. oh, hey marge."
40165,Homer,tell us more about this feast.
32584,Homer,"wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then i'm not gonna do it."
25772,Homer,i almost had a straight!
28915,Homer,you just don't understand boys. he's stupid.
32842,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
36399,Homer,"i have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know."
14151,Homer,"fit, damn you! fit!"
27341,Homer,what a rip! you all should be ashamed!
34789,Homer,then... his story was true!
26145,Homer,"i have eyes, don't i?"
31831,Homer,"did someone say ""snack""?"
32149,Homer,"if i'm gonna tell that woman the truth, i'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
37100,Homer,"marge, this has been great couples time. the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
33413,Homer,"oh, come on! that millionaire playboy? he's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the wayne foundation."
16271,Homer,that's it! i'm calling my buddies. marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
39504,Homer,"wait a minute, doc! your tv commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
18993,Homer,"oh, it makes no sense. i haven't changed since high school and suddenly i'm uncool. i've been kicked out of paradise."
15714,Homer,"your honor, i'd like that last remark stricken from the record."
36249,Homer,so you guys have any luck finding a new job?
22291,Homer,"well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? acting childish. kidnapping. child abuse..."
19632,Homer,so what?
31697,Homer,i'll pay for most of this!
24484,Homer,"run, marge, run! pump those crazy legs!"
19326,Homer,"ooh, that's tough, pal. but it's never going to happen to me."
13232,Homer,oh yeah... wife and two or three kids. can't imagine my life without 'em.
32273,Homer,"uh, that's still too sexy for my wife."
38305,Homer,i mean for adults!
17281,Homer,"come, family, sit in the snow with daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
35946,Homer,nerds! you want i should mess 'em up?
19321,Homer,"can i borrow a feeling? ""can i borrow a feeling?"" there's your picture on the front."
26634,Homer,sh-sh-sh.
18423,Homer,"oh, that's raspberry."
38826,Homer,"you're all right, stupid flanders. you're all right."
31915,Homer,"okay nappien, do your stuff."
40925,Homer,"boy, a good man really is hard to find."
39182,Homer,"just tell me one thing, marge. why did you lose faith in the revue? i mean, ""cats and dogs"" writes itself. cats and dogs on capital hill / they don't get along and never will"
31861,Homer,it's a documentary... by the b.b.c... in cooperation with canal plus...
16664,Homer,bee? aah!
16614,Homer,no wait! i know where the burglar is!
18476,Homer,i thought i dreamed that kiss.
24712,Homer,"a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a-weem..."
14437,Homer,"look marge, i can tell something's bothering you. but if you come out of that car, i promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. please, honey?"
20918,Homer,"you're a genius, moe. all your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
40224,Homer,what's that got to do with it?
14596,Homer,"you don't understand, marge. the lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. uh, the lottery and you."
41273,Homer,"oh, you don't want to know what i really think. now, look sad and say ""d'oh."""
32014,Homer,"i had to fight! lenny said his dad is hulk hogan, and i know he's not!"
22792,Homer,you throw da can away...
23819,Homer,"sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? he hit her again."
37555,Homer,"oh baby, that's all i needed to hear."
24307,Homer,"if i didn't, i'd lose their respect."
20351,Homer,"all right, then."
25829,Homer,yah!
34576,Homer,shark week just got cancelled.
19754,Homer,uhh... huh.
31108,Homer,i'm everywhere.
32434,Homer,i pay ten dollars a tube for those!
40078,Homer,ooh. beauty.
19249,Homer,"hold on, mr. burns. maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? all your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
35841,Homer,everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
19700,Homer,"oh, i don't get the job, do i? well, boo-hoo, i don't get to be a cartoon dog."
18359,Homer,can you recommend a doctor who will?
13682,Homer,"ooh, the touch of death."
26424,Homer,"oh, i quit. there's no convincing you. i'm gonna take a nap."
18951,Homer,"when you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""no"" on proposition 24!"
29252,Homer,but i need them for the articles!
39466,Homer,yahhhhhhhh!
20023,Homer,it's him! it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...

37693,Homer,my old pen pal from spain. eduardo.
21697,Homer,"i'm proud of you, boy. mmmm, loganberry."
18294,Homer,hello? yes? oh! uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... flanders has it. just smash open his house.
40623,Homer,poison! what should i do? what should i do? tell me quick!
32184,Homer,i thought she said polar bear.
29954,Homer,"so it's mondays at nine, on nbc."
35009,Homer,"do what you gotta do. the quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
14399,Homer,"only in forty-eight states. besides, it's a victimless crime. the only victim is moe, heh, heh, heh. and it's brought lisa and me together."
19099,Homer,thank you! come again!
26481,Homer,in real life he would die.
14139,Homer,we could all lose our jobs.
40406,Homer,the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress.
23898,Homer,"bart, i need a miracle!"
17904,Homer,"i don't know marge, i can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
15499,Homer,"thanks, moe."
19242,Homer,"what... but... marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
18391,Homer,"well, why don't you live in it then?"
15150,Homer,"well, this time you must be punished."
26546,Homer,"i told you, i have too much time on my hands."

41212,Homer,"thinking is your department, jerk! that's what i pay you in beer for!"
16481,Homer,go to hell!
38250,Homer,"well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
18073,Homer,"twenty on this one, my good man."
33734,Homer,what else do they got?
22850,Homer,you're upset about something. is this about that trip barney and i took to machu picchu?
34858,Homer,hell yeah!
16433,Homer,"okay, so we have one thing in common. but you know what i hate? drinking beer and watching tv."
40158,Homer,hey! get a load of that spread.
23119,Homer,"mel gibson is just a guy, marge. no different than me or lenny."
21166,Homer,"there a problem, honey?"
23276,Homer,still not clean! still not clean!
36430,Homer,"strad, where are you?"
17414,Homer,"it didn't blow over, marge. nothin' ever blows over for me."
28501,Homer,exactly.
20488,Homer,oh... oh... ooo... oh... yodel.
22312,Homer,do you like piña colonics / and getting caught in the rain...
28383,Homer,"maybe you're right, marge. or maybe you're right, candy ball. no, marge. then again... no, marge. definitely marge."
20169,Homer,boy the way the bee gees played...
32583,Homer,"and goodbye, cruller world."
26834,Homer,"if he wants to sleep with us, forget it."
16723,Homer,"union rule twenty-six - ""every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
31372,Homer,the senior olympics? that's what i was supposed to remember?!
23190,Homer,we shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
26350,Homer,"if we had artie's money, i could get that snoring surgery. plus at least two of those other surgeries i desperately need."
28064,Homer,"i've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but i never thought i'd hear it from you."
35185,Homer,"oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""
31499,Homer,angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
26224,Homer,"well, that's the last we'll see of them. come on, we're goin' to moe's."
37118,Homer,"ladies, please! you can boss me around, just one at a time!"
25687,Homer,"oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams."
34690,Homer,what are we watching?
20190,Homer,"oh, my father gave me beer as a child. till i wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
24911,Homer,"hello, operator? i'd like to report a really weird island. please send lots of rescue copters to..."
26992,Homer,now to make sure this hammock never troubles anyone again.
36345,Homer,"spoiler alert! i've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""coconut cream die."""
32807,Homer,what?
35255,Homer,but i haven't finished my rituals yet!
31427,Homer,"i said, god bless america!"
35217,Homer,i can't believe i'm riding around in cheech's van! the van made of weed!
41523,Homer,"oh, this is wonderful. i love you, atari."
28262,Homer,"ooh, that's lucky."
15696,Homer,"where's your science fair project, boy?"
39869,Homer,"hear him out, marge."
28300,Homer,"well, we put up a flyer."
32466,Homer,"yeah, i'm gonna turn off the lights now."
18595,Homer,then what are you dressed like that for?
27835,Homer,yeah.
27181,Homer,"well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. goodnight!"
19254,Homer,someone found my keys!
21694,Homer,enough bickering. i know how to settle this.
16161,Homer,"two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun..."
16616,Homer,"actually, it wasn't me. it was my dad, grampa."
22256,Homer,"anyhoo, we came out of walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships..."
28728,Homer,nope.
20234,Homer,"yeah. ""to lisa. never forget your daddy loves ."""
26494,Homer,we've gotta go after them.
28427,Homer,hold on. something doesn't feel right.
25063,Homer,"i hope it's flanders. i'm just kidding. hey, you're all right."
22668,Homer,hippie lady i wanna get out.
29880,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
18774,Homer,just my luck.
16676,Homer,"uh, i like to keep a lollipop there."
28547,Homer,now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on christmas to discover they have no presents.
29136,Homer,"just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. but don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy."
13841,Homer,"i love you, son."
38829,Homer,the nutcracker! every child's favorite christmas character! is this a dream?
34760,Homer,you stink!
31259,Homer,"by the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. if the kids ask, i did it."
26981,Homer,"man, are we evenly matched."
39572,Homer,"no, bart, no."
14051,Homer,"say your name? why should i do that, my lad?"
31526,Homer,"yeah, but there's something else. there's this loser staying in our house. marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does."
15018,Homer,"flanders, you saved me. why?"
38691,Homer,"excuse me, but grass is poking through."
27508,Homer,"lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. then take some time off for yourself. fly to france. have a nice dinner."
37837,Homer,good. we can use that.
26683,Homer,it's true we're losing money...
26335,Homer,but bold moves are no longer my forte!
17576,Homer,"oh, okay. have it your own way, marge. i'll be back in a minute. i'm going outside. to stalk... ... lenny and carl."
14953,Homer,you bet your sweet... ass!
25260,Homer,"and finally, make sure the net is tight and springy."
13883,Homer,you didn't mean that!
20810,Homer,"all i had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
38220,Homer,"well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. except at my profession."
20506,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not... oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
41221,Homer,don't tell him. give him a fake name.
40215,Homer,"not yet, son. not yet."
38756,Homer,how?
34032,Homer,"why can't i keep the job i have now, whatever it is?"
17658,Homer,and here's our tv next to the mirror. it looks like we have two.
13723,Homer,"hello, jerry? homer simpson. remember last month, when i paid back that loan? well, now i need you to do a favor for me."
15823,Homer,tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman i love. and i won't be back for ten minutes.
32295,Homer,"put me down, you lousy-- wheeee! okay, i'm warning you-- wheeee! i'll kill you, you son of a-- wheeee! all right buddy, that's it, i've had-- whee--!"
39687,Homer,"they've got us cornered, boy. we'll never get away. give me the head."
31828,Homer,"hey, lisa, self-conscious about your shins? in my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
20906,Homer,stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
32115,Homer,"fine, i'll show you a winner, just you watch."
15602,Homer,what am i supposed to do?
19606,Homer,uh... yes sir. i thought i was supposed to.
39474,Homer,"you know, moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me. she said, ""homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, god bless her soul, she was really onto something."
19646,Homer,your mother seems really upset about something. i better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
26051,Homer,easy.
14545,Homer,"sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, i ran for cover under the tallest tree i could find."
13539,Homer,"son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?"
18212,Homer,"oh, bartholemew, i feel like st. augustine of hippo after his conversion by ambrose of milan."
33193,Homer,"i know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
23432,Homer,"hey, i'm not dead yet."
39667,Homer,"g-g-good night, s-son. s-sleep tight."
30021,Homer,my little girl likes red vines! you little...
35918,Homer,it's still a great honor!
25635,Homer,"did you ever see that ""blue man group?"" total rip-off of the smurfs. and the smurfs? they suck."
25642,Homer,thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
32284,Homer,outside? that's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
14601,Homer,"correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
36041,Homer,"oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?"
27377,Homer,"anything to trick my daughter into liking me. now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at aol."
17897,Homer,but you're already smoking cig...
31246,Homer,listen... what would you say if i told you a woman did most of the work?
35329,Homer,"hey, let me down! this is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!"
38560,Homer,what?
21008,Homer,would you be proud of me?
37250,Homer,your famous murmur. you know .
28061,Homer,"yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."
41456,Homer,"i spent all night working on that speech, but now i realize the best thing to do is speak from my heart."
35623,Homer,"marge, i just saw the greatest movie. guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! i'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
27740,Homer,get rid of a bird? no way. their eyes are so expressive.
34241,Homer,where and what time?
19773,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. but i know something that will..."
24547,Homer,"that horoscope was baloney. nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. what's for dessert?"
21341,Homer,"bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal i have ever faced."
21070,Homer,"on second thought, go right."
20800,Homer,"well, you see, when i get bored, i make up my own movie. i have a very short attention span."
26664,Homer,all right. i'll do it for my kids.
34873,Homer,"did i? anyway, the bloody hangman set to his gory work. bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
29251,Homer,trying to.
40561,Homer,just give me a ticket.
29777,Homer,why you little...!
13608,Homer,don't be so...
35273,Homer,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
20990,Homer,"then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. but we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
26296,Homer,look at those abs.
22292,Homer,"not until you're older, son."
33035,Homer,make it life and you've got a deal.
24687,Homer,"yeah, it's hopeless."
18496,Homer,"oo, look, it's maggie!"
18890,Homer,"okay. okay. think, homer..."
37653,Homer,"to you, marge. now you are one of us."
40469,Homer,oh i can't watch.
40394,Homer,oatmeal?
35497,Homer,just in time for my lunch break / got my fork and spoon
33434,Homer,wait a minute...
40928,Homer,what is it this time?
16391,Homer,"wrong again, flanders."
16618,Homer,shut up.
24825,Homer,"the answer is no, mr. burns. not for any amount of money."
36408,Homer,stradivarius cain!
25535,Homer,hurry up. i can't stand here jabbing you all day.
32415,Homer,"your thoughts should stay in your head! heh, heh, i sure told him. now, what am i gonna do about marge?"
16493,Homer,"oh, baby."
38242,Homer,"oh my god. that's, that's shattering. and now, i'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy."
16111,Homer,"look, i'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. right, marge?"
41428,Homer,i'm here to take my life back!
38863,Homer,stupid kid! you ruin every trip!
17483,Homer,"you're no girl, you're a boy. a good boy. you can be president. scratch that. you will be president."
30288,Homer,we'll say it's all our birthdays!
18243,Homer,hey flanders!
30638,Homer,"it's called a hangover, sweetie. and it's an unavoidable part of life."
33401,Homer,"i do! oh, right."
22072,Homer,what? what? hey!
29396,Homer,are you prepared to take that chance?
20356,Homer,"hi. it seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. so if you'll have me, i would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
15206,Homer,"march 15... i wish i'd brought a tv. oh god, how i miss tv."
16073,Homer,"marge, try to understand. there are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. as a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
25613,Homer,comin' in from the left.
26947,Homer,"if that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, i love this song."
36648,Homer,"wait, the frog in the trench coat is kermit too?"
18377,Homer,oh my.
28951,Homer,and the castrati?
17075,Homer,"well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
18963,Homer,"no, i'm not. i'm teaching you about rock music."
23919,Homer,"oops, forgot to swirl it."
30096,Homer,please don't go! please? please? i command you!
18513,Homer,somebody ate those cookies.
28169,Homer,"no way. forget it. i might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but i am not a grim reaper."
30851,Homer,"lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. if they did, then my experiments could be called cruel."
16227,Homer,i guess killing will be fun enough.
25694,Homer,good idea.
26807,Homer,flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex!
27768,Homer,"look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. i f..."
23942,Homer,ships ahoy!
37359,Homer,they charged a deposit!
25605,Homer,"no, lisa, but i sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
25573,Homer,good ol' kitenge.
35624,Homer,someone snitched? wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
31698,Homer,"all right, you lured me to your bay. now what sick game are you playing?"
20261,Homer,war! hunh! good god y'all! / what is it good for? / absolutely nothin'! say it again! okay!
24884,Homer,whoa... he's in trouble.
22116,Homer,"oh, get that away from me!"
18252,Homer,ham?
13948,Homer,no sir.
23078,Homer,"yeah, and i'm clobbersaurus."
29058,Homer,do i get two paychecks?
37732,Homer,oh yeah. great. um... do i drop you at the curb or do i have to park and walk you in?
16554,Homer,"curse you, magic beans."
27408,Homer,the man who framed you is a crooked detective. who i hired!
34022,Homer,to love!
35611,Homer,that sucker soaks up flattery like a twinkie soaks up gravy.
18240,Homer,"come on, eat the can. come on."
32540,Homer,"oh my god, why would i wanna wipe out my memory? what horrible thing did i do?"
17961,Homer,put me on that film jury festival thing.
19882,Homer,"uh... nothing, marge. i think it must have been that bean i had for dinner."
13776,Homer,"what's your problem, boy?"
23465,Homer,you watch me. i'll grow something out there.
18284,Homer,"ah, the miracle mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. it truly is a miracle."
22462,Homer,"hey, stop shoving! i'm max power!"
40021,Homer,it's so unfair... just because he's different.
15925,Homer,mmm... pie.
27491,Homer,"flanders, what's your secret? you never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""mr. blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. it sickens me."
39280,Homer,"bart, did you hear that? what a name -- ""santa's little helper"". it's a sign! it's an omen!"
33987,Homer,"i'll save you, marge!"
16390,Homer,so many krustyburger locations.
34967,Homer,"i'd like a third helping, please."
32383,Homer,no one likes a know-it-all.
20442,Homer,"it's okay, son. you'll do better next time."
25471,Homer,"so hard to resist. mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... wait a minute, those are southwestern ingredients!"
38286,Homer,"marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
35121,Homer,deal!
23976,Homer,vietnam veteran.
18363,Homer,i don't know... fish sandwich? are you sure?
14580,Homer,lurleen.
20631,Homer,"you know me, marge. i crave the hustle and bustle."
22630,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't frick and frack, jack and jill, fred and ethel, the three..."
34658,Homer,marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
22412,Homer,"hmmmm, i guess i could... but while i'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
15893,Homer,no son of mine is gonna be a 19th century cockney bootblack. we're gonna find you another school.
20919,Homer,why all the pearls? why all the hair? why anything?
27654,Homer,do - you - hear - a - noise?
20977,Homer,"okay. uh, this is your second cousin stanley."
16363,Homer,ah! the last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
21451,Homer,why did this happen? whyyyyyy?
17615,Homer,that's because you trust your stupid school books. here's what really happened at the signing of the declaration of independence...
39815,Homer,but where will i sleep?
24758,Homer,"oh, how embarrassing. well, let me just give you one of my many other valid..."
27809,Homer,i hope it's as fun as pictionary was last week.
40521,Homer,there's peas in my fruit cobbler.
29293,Homer,"oh, homer, you're wasting away to nothing. you simply must eat something. well, you're the boss!"
22032,Homer,"well, actually i-- hey! quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
35735,Homer,"relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville."
23227,Homer,the boy's still studying?
20040,Homer,i'll do it. to professionalism!
35642,Homer,"are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""
40114,Homer,a lot of you would think i was crazy if i did this.
33736,Homer,don't have one.
39044,Homer,"elon, elon, elon! i want to say something to you and i don't want you to be inspired by it. i want you to listen."
15570,Homer,all in favor of skipping the poem?
15620,Homer,have a good time! wait a minute.
36169,Homer,"deep down, i must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! and my problem won't stop till i make things right with them. but first, a little more sleep."
33128,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but... stupid flanders."
21961,Homer,nothing's too good for my one and only.
39213,Homer,a what!
17069,Homer,"not tonight, marge. tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
38768,Homer,what? so you can also get famous and bail on us? you're out of the band!
16630,Homer,oh my god! that's his lucky red hat!
35024,Homer,"hm, better check last year's return."
40582,Homer,"oh, marge..."
39268,Homer,"now let's not get mushy, son. i still have a job to do."
40232,Homer,i was only reading what the card...
31081,Homer,"oh no! he's marge's, and my, dream man! i've gotta make a play for her now or i might lose her forever!"
33120,Homer,here we are.
28031,Homer,you see? i'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
22735,Homer,"oh, i shoulda known. they're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
34506,Homer,"clancy, i haven't seen my family in days. would you mind if i went home now?"
22803,Homer,mmmm... hippo...
18286,Homer,i want a colossal donut. just like the one on the sign.
23810,Homer,"lisa, help!"
41492,Homer,this viking stuff is too dangerous. i'm going to become a gentleman art thief.
19281,Homer,"helen, as a responsible parent, i was already well aware of that."
23151,Homer,they will if you set up that the dog is evil. all you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
35327,Homer,"lisa, don't feel bad. judas betrayed jesus but he still got paid."
18184,Homer,"yeah. if that mafia guy weren't staring at us, i'd take off my towel."
36038,Homer,"boy, i told you an hour ago. stop that!"
17423,Homer,are you hugging the tv?
14694,Homer,"moe, i was a hundred miles outta town."
26784,Homer,you might hear from your friends or co-workers that apu isn't living at home anymore.
21976,Homer,steamed maine cabbages!
34639,Homer,you take that back!
33692,Homer,i'm telling!
30681,Homer,"oh, that is so cool! ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!"
26765,Homer,"""unique, unite..."""
20162,Homer,and why is grampa here?
22241,Homer,"i hear digging, but i don't hear chopping."
27688,Homer,i didn't say anything. so naïve.
22969,Homer,"don't worry, mr. burns. we're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. besides, i'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
38597,Homer,"bad news, bears. forecast calls for nothing but rain."
27063,Homer,a hot babe...
18852,Homer,i don't know.
26241,Homer,i'm here to break a world record. what's the longest anyone's ever done this?
15430,Homer,eh.
23024,Homer,"hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""weird"" was here?! i love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."
24611,Homer,good idea.
25123,Homer,"and they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
37254,Homer,union!
31146,Homer,"interesting, interesting...."
17082,Homer,"honey, the door blew shut! oh. fine. that's what you want? you got it. this scene is gettin' old, man. i'm hittin' the road. maybe i'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world."

26744,Homer,"you're trying to get me angry, thank you."
15605,Homer,whyyyyy?!... howwwww?!... whennnn?!... whichhh?...
20751,Homer,"now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh marge?"
32427,Homer,we're gonna be rich! we can finally start a family!
33985,Homer,"well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night."
19364,Homer,lisa's window is the next one!
35133,Homer,okay... i'll take some of... that.
40022,Homer,"burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? go get 'em."
37056,Homer,fine. but i swear: i will win you back from lenny.
36394,Homer,"no, this is really good. i..."
30143,Homer,"thanks, ned."
18742,Homer,the dastard!
21628,Homer,"sure! believe me, every man in america will want to have one."
40462,Homer,"come on, flanders, he's not that bad."
25176,Homer,"relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
30672,Homer,"so this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""m"". moleman? mr. burns? m. night shyamalan? that would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
38130,Homer,"circle ""other."""
30453,Homer,ooh! ooh! i wanna ride the bumper cars!
40397,Homer,"oh... well, flan-ders, it doesn't matter. this time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels."
37425,Homer,what are you talking about?
26740,Homer,homer mad!
14243,Homer,"wow! kid, i won't let you down."
13647,Homer,"oh, here we go again. look, i don't care if ned flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. end of story."
28639,Homer,i can't see! i'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
14827,Homer,that's right. there's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
33323,Homer,could've been. if we hadn't had kids.
37517,Homer,"but first, m'lady, let me escort you to heaven -- the fancy swiss chocolate store on level three!"
15628,Homer,"ehhh, maybe this was a mistake."
31419,Homer,"well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
38678,Homer,"aww, i will treasure this forever."
40451,Homer,truckasaurous!
17184,Homer,i was doing my best to resist her...
17260,Homer,john denver.
30041,Homer,i don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
39110,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i was proud of myself."
38357,Homer,"have a good day, you two! don't be me!"
41415,Homer,here we go... here we go... here we go...
29751,Homer,"hey, i couldn't leave you kids. you're like my own family. now check this place out!"
22491,Homer,"oh, they're newlyweds. they'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
17467,Homer,they didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
29304,Homer,"well, that explains a lot. who's hungry?"
34499,Homer,"ooh, ooh! can i cuff him?!"
16948,Homer,"yeah, let's push him down the steps."
38511,Homer,"i love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name."
15296,Homer,fine. i'll never ever do another stupid thing. good night!
14354,Homer,"doh, not the wind."
30153,Homer,wait'll i tell everyone about this! i'll feel important without drinking! that'll be weird.
29598,Homer,"coolee, coolee cool! c'mon, fool! be coolee, coolee cool!"
29559,Homer,"after forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and noah sent forth a single dove..."
35745,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid! we forgot to create a fake author!"
37596,Homer,what was the first one again?
15645,Homer,"come on, bart. we had our fun. remember when i used to push you on the swing?"
13464,Homer,eh.... the boy.
22718,Homer,"uh, yeah. i need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
17648,Homer,"loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the battle of gettysburg."
15874,Homer,"bart, lisa i have something to tell you, and i'm not proud of it."
23991,Homer,tunnel!
28903,Homer,"oh, i get it. blame the strangler."
38136,Homer,fighting tweakers rule!
30934,Homer,that's me!
25893,Homer,since when?
25188,Homer,"oh god, my back..."
16078,Homer,hold me.
40913,Homer,i'll take that bet.
33236,Homer,i'm really thirty-eight.
18081,Homer,"aw, thanks, honey."
36568,Homer,"i'm right behind you, honey! we have stairs?!"
29981,Homer,oh boy.
19541,Homer,"no, i refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks i'm crazy. unless you're feeling... amorous?"
22238,Homer,"geez, i've never seen anyone so whipped so fast."
24604,Homer,what really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
23192,Homer,"how did the country lose its way, mel? when did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
39825,Homer,"what do you mean, sir?"
25071,Homer,we're free! and we've got something to eat.
30487,Homer,'tis the season to be jolly...
23651,Homer,"hey apu. sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?"
37256,Homer,we really appreciate that.
29897,Homer,"well if i was, we'd have taller kids!"
39085,Homer,"ditto. you know i've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and i think you just might be the guy."
18659,Homer,then we're agreed. there'll be trouble.
37776,Homer,"shake it! now, roll over on your tummy, just like i taught you."
18841,Homer,"troy, buddy, i gotta know. what's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like selma?"
20366,Homer,"mmm, you probably left them at work. on another topic, guess who was picked to host the next nra get-together?"
37465,Homer,wait a minute! something's reflected in the lenses of carl's sunglasses!
14041,Homer,"i talked to flanders about parenting. i'm a perfect father. hold on, son, i'm-a coming!"
17126,Homer,"but why? she's such a fox. i mean, what's on fox tonight? something ribald, no doubt."
30674,Homer,"there's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""m""!"
21039,Homer,you're a disgrace to this family and its proud naval tradition!
39823,Homer,"no, barn. i just want to crawl into bed."
28330,Homer,i see an opening.
27330,Homer,gator gulch?
24774,Homer,but how do i get it?
25932,Homer,"now, time for ""operation: judge-get-back-at."""
23330,Homer,uninspired.
31722,Homer,"come on, dad, i'm cuttin' back everywhere. to save gas i'm ""flintstone-ing"" the car."
33356,Homer,"hey, vance?"
29453,Homer,i win...
18804,Homer,"i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job was all he had. imagine how you'd feel, marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
33993,Homer,how do i know you're not a muncher?
14662,Homer,"ah, this movie's too complicated... hey, the floor's sticky..."
16518,Homer,"wait. i see what's happening here. you're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. well, that's just sad."
16277,Homer,we pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two popsicles out of the freezer.
38902,Homer,what's that?
40187,Homer,why you little --!
29290,Homer,"every simpson starts with a circle. daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. hm, i'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""m"" and a ""g."""
16674,Homer,"stop being such babies. you can't be afraid to try new things. for instance, tonight i'm using a... apu, what do you call this thing again?"
28491,Homer,"hey, everybody! we're going shopping at the springfield heights promenade!"
20433,Homer,"now while i wasn't able to cut everyone i wanted to, i have cut a lot of you. wendell is cut. rudy is cut. janey, you're gone. steven, i like your hustle. that's why it was so hard to cut you."
13536,Homer,"lisa, you like homework. could you fill out this form for me?"
18802,Homer,"mr. burns, is there anything at all i can do for you?"
41014,Homer,oh fine. we're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
24938,Homer,"oh, marge. it's me, the real homer!"
30826,Homer,hey... that's the same thing you said to bart after he choked in that soccer game. and we both know he sucked.
35187,Homer,"now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town."
36450,Homer,thou sayest it!
18067,Homer,they're butchering the classics. could that bassoon have come in any more late?
27980,Homer,sweet.
35789,Homer,"okay, let's go."
14837,Homer,i think i'm gonna take a walk.
32508,Homer,"yeah, well, between you and me, i still can't stand him."
32241,Homer,you know you make me wanna
18545,Homer,hmmm. we didn't have a message when we left. how very odd.
35139,Homer,"so, what brings you here, mr. chair?"
17844,Homer,sweet land of liberty... of thee i sing.
24236,Homer,i know what you mean. our dog had that.
25279,Homer,"okay, honey. i can see this means a lot to you. i'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
39640,Homer,"now don't worry. our situation isn't as bad as it seems. and you're forgetting, i'm an experienced woodsman. now you all stay here for a minute while i go over this way and try to get my bearings."
28646,Homer,we'll clean out those stupid americans.
27146,Homer,no problem.
33100,Homer,"hey, everybody pees in the pool!"
29662,Homer,you monster!
17273,Homer,heeeeere's johnny.
33172,Homer,"keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only."
21233,Homer,"hellooo springfield! it's me, homer!"
32604,Homer,"no, this is a moment i want to remember."
16677,Homer,pass the chutney.
14433,Homer,what should i say?
35947,Homer,but gravy is the freedom where--
26337,Homer,"ah, this beer's deliskous. i'm gonna saves me wife! now let's get this show on the road."
28587,Homer,"for true, son."
34296,Homer,"listen, lisa. you're gonna find more than you bargained for. if i were you, i wouldn't dig into the past. i lived in some of that past, and i got out for a reason."
38892,Homer,"...but perhaps earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. oh, and the golden age of radio."
30977,Homer,"so, thou art a widow, eh?! then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee."
27717,Homer,"tip two, ""let nothing stand in your way."""
23671,Homer,"free baby cola? apu hits the jackpot, and i'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets."
23571,Homer,"yes, bart's weird friend."
31945,Homer,what the hell is that?
34104,Homer,"all right, all right, um, your ankle goes there..."
23030,Homer,"well, let's check the old bank account."
22928,Homer,"""d"" it up, marge. i'm goin' to the hole."
30376,Homer,why would you do that? are you a bad parent?
26392,Homer,you wait 'til next month! you wait 'til next month!
22570,Homer,i'm not gonna hurt him. i'm just gonna wake him up.
13509,Homer,homer simpson.
26200,Homer,"no! i will never... oh wait, it's blatz."
15815,Homer,"okay, okay. this time i'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him."
30515,Homer,"sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true, isn't it, sweetie?"
31856,Homer,you said it -- enjoy me while i last.
30521,Homer,then what protects you if we crash?
18147,Homer,f-f-f-f-f-f-
35672,Homer,"i don't want to think about food, i want to like it. why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different krustyburgers we can see from our house?"
15721,Homer,does the lord count as a person?
22206,Homer,"fine, i'll do it. where do you want me?"
20129,Homer,"oh, i can't take it anymore. all right, i'll only be gone for a second."
30710,Homer,only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
32075,Homer,true -- but there's room for the truth in this household. do you wanna hear something really bad kent told me about the fox network?
17236,Homer,"hey look, this one's coming on to me."
13975,Homer,how much?
35101,Homer,"cherish that family smile / picket fence days go something something / the future is coming soon / mom and dad and kids are sommmmething that's my favorite song now. sorry ""don't fear the reaper."" everybody! air guitar! come on, do it with me! use your whammy bar! whew! now fuzz it up! excellent!"
33121,Homer,"kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me."
41155,Homer,likely story.
35513,Homer,"say... wayne, i couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. you want to go grab a beer after work?"
41383,Homer,"...mcnuggets. mmm, mcnuggets."
18851,Homer,i'm sorry. i guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
24571,Homer,here's a better idea -- i know how we can replace those children.
26280,Homer,"come on! give it! i know, i'll try reverse psychology. i don't want that stupid map."
41156,Homer,"oh, why did i have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
24188,Homer,"anyhoo, i'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. something that has revitalized cities from east st. louis to biloxi, mississippi. the magic medicine of... casino gambling!"
38117,Homer,you won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
30581,Homer,why does every woman i try to talk to run into cans?
34017,Homer,"i want to french kiss a frenchman, and spoon an english duke / 'cause frankly, dear, to not be queer, just makes me want to puke..."
37568,Homer,i still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
23185,Homer,i think so.
23250,Homer,why don't you just tell everybody?
22485,Homer,"hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" eh."
22837,Homer,"i'm gonna be an outsider artist! that way, i can turn all these old baseball cards, disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
19117,Homer,all right.
20106,Homer,good. i don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. you wait here at the bus station while i get the car.
28779,Homer,"well, marge, you can't say i never take you anywhere."
25110,Homer,"c'mon, marge. we're a team! it's uter-us, not uter-you."
15916,Homer,"marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head."
16712,Homer,"thank you, thank you very much!"
23914,Homer,"a mechanical dressing dealy! watch this, marge."
35398,Homer,"all day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and i have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
24246,Homer,yeah!
32239,Homer,and i know something much more fun i can do on my back.
40585,Homer,but don't worry. i'll never let on. i'll still do all the bed stuff. maybe it won't be so bad.
38273,Homer,don't worry. it's bottom all right.
21453,Homer,"it was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. plus i'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than i let on."
16537,Homer,can't talk now.
24698,Homer,"oh, come on. tell us how we can make it up to you. hey, pretend it's your birthday."
27869,Homer,why you little...!
19178,Homer,yes!!
13713,Homer,you're gonna live in your car?
21574,Homer,"cut it out, boy!"
41427,Homer,no.
24519,Homer,"no, something that rocks. that's the sound of today."
18187,Homer,saxa-ma-phone. saxa-ma-phone.
31298,Homer,i used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
25848,Homer,"die, you monster!"
17232,Homer,thank you!
41530,Homer,"i thought you were telling me you wanted to apply yourself to making a collage. and as i recall, i was against it."
32325,Homer,"goodnight, sweetheart."
35939,Homer,huh? who's there?
14952,Homer,"whyyy, oh whyyy... delilahhh?"
32109,Homer,"if you're gonna film me, i insist on a body double."
19358,Homer,let me show you how it works. this baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. it automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. listen.
32353,Homer,marge is a professional assassin!
17499,Homer,it's raining men?
13809,Homer,i'd like to see that.
35966,Homer,i got this song fever
37067,Homer,"okay, you're right. it's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but i think the choice is obvious -- my dad."
26700,Homer,are the proceeds going to charity?
40399,Homer,'fraid not.
34064,Homer,hey ned.
14572,Homer,"no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
31866,Homer,look what i can do!
21032,Homer,ulll.....
17837,Homer,"look at this country: ""u - r - gay."""
18431,Homer,tank must be shut down manually?! stupid bird! i never should have put you in charge! why you...
22252,Homer,"so long, su--"
38649,Homer,a robot with a catchphrase!
32045,Homer,sure do. let's go get ice cream!
36728,Homer,dinner time! i know you're hungry! i can hear you rubbing your legs together! oh my god!
14607,Homer,i've got so many tickets i can't lose!
37205,Homer,why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
36483,Homer,will you stop this stupid crap? / i wanna take a nap!
27715,Homer,"tip one, ""live each day like it was your last."""
13486,Homer,where is it?
31613,Homer,"so this map leads to a treasure, huh?"
38196,Homer,prove it.
25219,Homer,you're gonna regret this.
35489,Homer,"ned, i've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! endless, endless forgiving!"
25883,Homer,"c'mon, hug me..."
25453,Homer,"nice try, god."
22458,Homer,"woo, privilege!"
21543,Homer,what is it?
27369,Homer,"oh, my daughter hates me because i don't know anything about her."
30548,Homer,"bloop, bloop, bloop. bloop, bloop, bloop."
32332,Homer,"an hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. with my free time i can finally work on my ""superman"" novel."
23548,Homer,mr. burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
26431,Homer,ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
26667,Homer,"oh, yeah. get out."
32326,Homer,can't be late for lisa's big day...
16827,Homer,"love, marge. don't hate. love."
34505,Homer,you saved my life. and i came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
16526,Homer,"bart, i don't want to alarm you, but there may be a boogeyman or boogeymen in the house!"
38959,Homer,i'd be too nervous. have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
28136,Homer,"back off, moe. maggie wants to be with me."
17355,Homer,pass the ketchup.
36154,Homer,"well sir, before i do anything i stop and ask myself, ""what would jesus and mr. burns do?"""
26932,Homer,who said it was a he?
16673,Homer,"okay, okay i'll let him. but then i get a chipwich, okay?"
23924,Homer,"everybody. i found burnsie's address book. i called the new york yankees and told them to bunt, and then i called the queen of england and asked her how it was going, and then i..."
30218,Homer,"...i coveted the wife in ""jaws 2,"" i lied to a waiter, i masturbated eight million times and i have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
18406,Homer,"y, y... what the heck are you doing over there?"
25662,Homer,leave ned alone.
13363,Homer,"sorry, reverend."
23806,Homer,"lisa, i'll do the dishes when i pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. see, there it is. but that was a practice. the system works!"
34067,Homer,classic.
39833,Homer,"hello, marge. it's me. homer."
37897,Homer,"guys, guys, i saw the radioactive man movie! here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. number nine--"
23164,Homer,"do the words ""executive producer"" mean anything to you?"
27600,Homer,"well, kathy, i'll tell you. it's viagrogaine. it gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. what are you waiting for, loser?"
28881,Homer,"flanders, can you watch my kids while i'm at the rehab clinic?"
31295,Homer,no.
40051,Homer,"they call this a portion? hey lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? dry fish sticks. this sucks."
25359,Homer,"38! that's roughly my age! marge, after a lot of thought, i've decided to run the springfield marathon."
28606,Homer,doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
37186,Homer,your hair is growing back! tell me your secret!
18613,Homer,because i'm trying to reduce my boredom.
35699,Homer,the experience begins!
39652,Homer,"when you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. it becomes natural. like a third sense."
22684,Homer,they like me because i'm brave.
24455,Homer,"hey, we got a postcard from bart. ""dear mom and homer. i'm having fun."" aw, sounds like he's having fun."
34088,Homer,again!
29744,Homer,"hey, i earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, i'm at work busting my hump."
30366,Homer,uh... this is still part of your dream. dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
26953,Homer,in one car? with no air conditioning? and the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
41249,Homer,twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
31953,Homer,"lousy burns so ungrateful, i hate him so much..."
19794,Homer,"hey, boy, wake up! your old man found some deer!"
18565,Homer,the all igh-ty ollar? i get it.
30559,Homer,"that's right, i am a man! the man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. let's meet her now."
13566,Homer,"oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. i mean, they think i'm a god."
15786,Homer,woo hoo!
40718,Homer,that makes two of us.
29890,Homer,"one, two, three, four -- i declare a nail war!"
37999,Homer,"carl, it's me! i'm here! really here!"
38052,Homer,"where's my money? do you have my money? where is it? you know, if you had the money, i'm right here. do you have the money?"
26609,Homer,"drop it in, don't cram it in. oh, forget it, i'll do it myself."
28751,Homer,yeah!
40825,Homer,"i've got a problem. once you stop this car, i'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then i'll never be able to let you go."
13771,Homer,"well, thank you."
16880,Homer,"marge, i agree with you, in theory. in theory communism works. in theory."
31851,Homer,"when i put on these shorts, i'm not your father anymore. and judging by how tight they are, i'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
25862,Homer,and a blue oyster cult medallion.

31185,Homer,leave him to me.
26163,Homer,i think this tree could use an angel.
41297,Homer,"all right! ""try it"" means sex."
17151,Homer,no!
17816,Homer,oh yeah. speed holes.
23922,Homer,and another thing: if i ev...
32698,Homer,"that wasn't us, that was the transmission."

13506,Homer,"lisa, i don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
30280,Homer,hello? marge? where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?

16353,Homer,"ah... boy, if only bart had been a better role model for everyone."
23287,Homer,"marge, shh! it's important that no one know that i'm a food critic."
21206,Homer,"so-ho, the rats seem happy."
40795,Homer,"i can't believe it, it's sticking. you're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! and it's all thanks to you. marge, when i see you forming the vowels and continents --"
35376,Homer,"and now, to break the news as gently as i know how."

30910,Homer,"i've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. i, homer simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to springfield."

17219,Homer,"we don't need to do that, marge. i'm not tired. i'm not tired at all."
32350,Homer,hey! now i don't get paid!
16018,Homer,this isn't just because of sideshow bob. it's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
27631,Homer,"yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
27967,Homer,i always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
25919,Homer,"wait. i'm to blame, judge. you see, i was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly..."
32360,Homer,"well, they're not as pretty as you, marge."
24967,Homer,who gave you all this money?
28786,Homer,"how 'bout ""diet coke -- the movie?""... ""president air bud: tail to the chief?""... ""my big fat greek salad?"""
32141,Homer,say it!
39353,Homer,"well, i guess we don't have to do that."
18453,Homer,you see that stone angel up there? that's my mother's grave. my dad points it out every time we drive by.

38923,Homer,"the circus? hmmm, i haven't been to the circus since i was a kid."
15717,Homer,"it's funny `cause i don't know him. heh, heh, heh."
24588,Homer,c'mon lads! let's drive them back to the ocean!
21182,Homer,"lisa, don't you ruin another love day."
37211,Homer,"it's okay, dad. we know the truth, and we love you."
23307,Homer,the other critics told me to be mean. and you should always give in to peer pressure.
32661,Homer,a tale of two young outlaws in love...
23474,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i'm no farmer."

21237,Homer,"my campaign is a disaster, moe."
19419,Homer,stupor pooper.
24336,Homer,"barney, no! don't!"
18056,Homer,"oh i'm sure he knew. and i'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy."

21970,Homer,"well, i guess this is it, ol' pal. this is your big day."
37749,Homer,"yeah, wow, that does feel good. oh no, i think it's coming. i haven't even picked a name yet!"
34229,Homer,wait!
31459,Homer,"marge? i have an apology that i hope is better than all the other ones. so please listen carefully. the thing i liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love i received from obese children. it was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
17652,Homer,"go knightboat, go!"
40664,Homer,"flanders, i said i didn't -- tomorrow? sure, what the hey. i'd love to come to your barbecue. i'll even bring the thickest, juiciest t-bones you've ever seen."
16104,Homer,what?
15720,Homer,so they say i might have a problem.
16014,Homer,"woo hoo! did you hear, bart? oh."
38609,Homer,and all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.

27753,Homer,"eat crowd, old man!"

17001,Homer,ooh.
27175,Homer,can i help you?
24348,Homer,yeah. so what do you call this stuff?
29378,Homer,"hey, maybe the internet has the information i need! it certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement."
20063,Homer,"well, i know one thing in this world that's still pure and good."
35342,Homer,you are cruel but fair.
19040,Homer,i'll take that.
20786,Homer,"so, i beat the system."
26643,Homer,"oops! i thought this was the can, man."
16441,Homer,"well, this is my floor."
36163,Homer,"not just the laundry... that would be weird, and you might ask questions. i wanna do all the chores!"
34209,Homer,"now, what should i buy first? hitler's baseball? a mirror that gives me advice?"
17704,Homer,"can't talk, praying. dear lord, the gods have been good to me and i am thankful. for the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
21207,Homer,that's not the way she tells it.
40495,Homer,don't you think i know that?
40247,Homer,"wow! flash bailor came on to my wife! you've still got the magic, marge."
28232,Homer,"mom, i swear on your eventual grave i will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. uh-oh."
40634,Homer,"told ya. now, come on. you're gonna learn how to shave."
15301,Homer,"uh, huh, that's mr. plow."
24071,Homer,"but, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game."
34708,Homer,arctic circle! i just got that!
29977,Homer,"güten abend, my brave, bavarian overlords. the best wurst in town."
23486,Homer,it's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
14061,Homer,"patty, selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
33176,Homer,seymour... edna asked me to talk to you.
14046,Homer,he's not so fat.
24148,Homer,here you go. knock yourself out.
25632,Homer,"quick, moe! marge cut off my thumb!"
26185,Homer,"don't blame me, blame tinseltown and its second golden age. may it never end."
20821,Homer,i've never been so happy.

27823,Homer,"hey, what's this? ""marge's memory chest."""
34800,Homer,"i know, i know. don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows frankenstein. it's racist somehow."
16029,Homer,"wow, a houseboat! you know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
33863,Homer,sometimes i think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
35933,Homer,only one hundred percent?
31165,Homer,cancellations require twenty-four hours no-tice.
21381,Homer,"mmmaybe... but you don't know lisa. i mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
32038,Homer,"absolutely, all the time. i go to the floss store and they're like, ""whoa, there he is again."" 'cause i buy so much floss."
18080,Homer,"marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. and i have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
19724,Homer,"nine hundred dollars? well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
30760,Homer,woo hoo! vegas here i come!
28315,Homer,"aw dad, i wish there was something i could do."
37678,Homer,and you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. so i'm gettin' you shined up nice.
20656,Homer,what a deal! i'd be a sucker not to get it.
16459,Homer,"oh mindy, you came and you gave without flaking. but i sent you ben-gay, oh andy, you kissed me and stopped me from something, and i..."
41334,Homer,or was it?
31848,Homer,i don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!
15864,Homer,i'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
29774,Homer,don't worry about the suvs. there's a gentle curve up ahead.
16349,Homer,"hey, boy! in here!"
24620,Homer,"well, i've had it! you rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!"
27270,Homer,"the ""george foreman mail sorter"" will let us know."
39442,Homer,"where are you, kids?"
25956,Homer,maybe i will.
39779,Homer,"marge, may i speak to you?"
26245,Homer,"yeah, they're called ""congress""."
25923,Homer,dammit!
40266,Homer,your team needs you! c'mon!!!
34150,Homer,how would he know grampa was going to die today? unless... he was going to kill him! but would someone really kill a man just to win a pulitzer prize?
40940,Homer,"oh, there's the little prom queen now."
18296,Homer,i told you: flanders has it. or moe! go kill moe.
13716,Homer,oh.

22767,Homer,why won't you be art?!
30848,Homer,i fell asleep before the monkey.
26735,Homer,they call me mellow yellow... quite rightly! this fellow never bellows... quite rightly!
31731,Homer,"dad, do you know what you were kissing? do you? do you?"
15204,Homer,"marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. we only have five hundred in the bank. that leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
40140,Homer,"quiet, lisa. you're scaring your mother."
17181,Homer,"oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
21052,Homer,uh-huh.
15719,Homer,my name is homer and i'm just here because the court made me come.
38822,Homer,"flanders, are you crying?"
38482,Homer,that better not mean what it means when i say it.
30383,Homer,"goodbye, thanks for coming. if my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
13151,Homer,"well, i can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight."
40701,Homer,marge! marge!

16808,Homer,no! i want everyone to know that this is ned flanders... my friend!
28034,Homer,"now now, honey. we all appreciate what you do. but real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. you could get in a lot of trouble with the livery commission."
35560,Homer,so much violence on the surface world. i'm going back.
34404,Homer,"hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. what are you up to?"
25427,Homer,"yes, sir."
32671,Homer,"ah, the tunnel of love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy."
33279,Homer,run for your lives!
32452,Homer,fashions.
17534,Homer,"lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
31389,Homer,"they got an open bar at this thing, right?"
18249,Homer,"you know what you should serve, marge? more of these lamb chops. these are the best ever."
19584,Homer,"i had a feeling things would work out for you, honey."
19033,Homer,"deal. see, flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
24460,Homer,oh! what's that awful sound?
39534,Homer,"and if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. that little doozy's been a simpson trademark for generations."
22898,Homer,and is that us on the roof?
39812,Homer,why you little --
34185,Homer,"she's not my girlfriend. she's a girl who i married, who used to be my friend."

14700,Homer,"shut up, boy. marge, what do you think?"
15175,Homer,"i know you're upset right now, so i'll pretend you didn't say that."
30803,Homer,"sure! you're gonna be all ""i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!"""

18489,Homer,at least this time i'm awake for your goodbye.
16327,Homer,"all right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
41543,Homer,"apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up."
28860,Homer,"ahh, the germans. you just can't stay mad at 'em."
19157,Homer,nothing big. it's just a lot of little things.

36101,Homer,"you would do that? oh my god, this might be a marge's birthday where i get sex!"
31406,Homer,what'd i do?
21215,Homer,"and to think you wanted me to crawl, marge! well, this man doesn't crawl. he stands tall. that rhymes, marge, and you know it rhymes. admit it!"
28765,Homer,"if you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. i'm slappin' this sucker right over ""support our troops."""
16635,Homer,why not? i remember my first after-school job. i was in a band.
17682,Homer,woo hoo!
19012,Homer,"really? me, too. but i got kicked out 'cause of my views on vietnam. also, i was stealing projectors."
15120,Homer,oh no. i'm not making two stops.
27807,Homer,night... glorious night...
24943,Homer,truly god's country.
40860,Homer,"oh, boy!"

22348,Homer,stop eating our tickets!
13430,Homer,are you?
33646,Homer,"i'm gonna say this for the last time: bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
37335,Homer,"for reasons i forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. but what i know for sure, is that i want to share it with you."
39003,Homer,oopsie.
24096,Homer,"beautiful! and star-wipe, aaaand we're out."
27956,Homer,"well, two can play at that game."
19433,Homer,ooh. i don't feel so good.
27637,Homer,flanders?! can't a man just drink alone on a wednesday morning?
17792,Homer,to- audience -i - now - proclaim - this - new - burger... for sale.
40047,Homer,a thousand bucks. i can't afford that.
24968,Homer,"really. hey, maybe we could do that again. can you look even more pathetic?"
39591,Homer,oh! oh! block it.
36251,Homer,maybe i should be heading home.
31905,Homer,you would be.
15973,Homer,"come on, honey. it'll only be till we finish our tour of sweden."
15211,Homer,marge have you seen my lunch box?
21327,Homer,hm.
20608,Homer,"hey, skinner! wanna drag race?"
30862,Homer,lenny! bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! chop-chop!
13709,Homer,"uh, there's a store where..."
17562,Homer,what should we do until you get back?
24711,Homer,i fold.
25802,Homer,i liked that story 'cause i was a judge.
28025,Homer,public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. i guess i'll walk.
25689,Homer,"don't say that, ned!"
24846,Homer,that's right! top of the line!
36661,Homer,"what the?! stupid calendar. first you put the fourth of july on sunday, and now this! ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
22193,Homer,"in the impulse zone. if you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. like this."
38340,Homer,why you little! i'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!
17248,Homer,"yes, ma'am. sideshow bob. yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
40123,Homer,and... and?! what about loving me?
26887,Homer,i knew it!
19270,Homer,"c'mon, boy. give your old man a little credit."
34054,Homer,but i have to get back to marge.
29958,Homer,"marge, no machine could ever replace you. why you-- or could it?"
24619,Homer,"and as usual, we joe twelve-packs get the royal screw job."
32530,Homer,or yourselves?
37629,Homer,all good.
36372,Homer,"worthless, worthless, worthless..."
37266,Homer,"better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
25084,Homer,i'm a little teapot / short and stout / here is my handle / here is my spout.
38442,Homer,i've had my problems with sparklers.
17760,Homer,"of course i'm right. if i'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
21240,Homer,it is?
22731,Homer,"and if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!"
23209,Homer,andy dick...
35616,Homer,life imitates flart.
24088,Homer,"hey, ned."
14187,Homer,"those were idealistic days... the candidacy of john anderson, the rise of supertramp... it was an exciting time to be young!"
38833,Homer,"mmm, load-bearing wall."
38561,Homer,"keep your pants on, marge. it's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" and parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
37734,Homer,"now, listen... i have to work late tonight."
14434,Homer,yes it's me!
31142,Homer,sorry i'm late! i was just gathering my counseling equipment.
22778,Homer,"c'mon, eve. hurry!"
22302,Homer,"speak for yourself! bart, get down here! i'm gonna spank you back to the stone age!"
17578,Homer,"hee hee hee! i can see everything. and they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
41123,Homer,"excuse me. excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? he looks like me, but he's wrinkled? hello, have you seen a..."
14048,Homer,"boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. sheesh, what an ego."
21498,Homer,"marge, uh, can we not land here?... honey?... baby doll...?"
22142,Homer,nooooooooo!!!
18292,Homer,get what?
23933,Homer,"mmmm, danish."
15814,Homer,"oooh, ahh. ha! got him!"
13230,Homer,"talky thing, ain't ya..."
29253,Homer,"of course not. why would i want to look at a nude woman i'm not even married to? i mean, i wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
40700,Homer,"oh, i can't wait any longer. hold on, marge. i'm comin' home, baby."
25805,Homer,"oh, it shows. i was gonna say something, but i thought it might sound you know, weird."
18803,Homer,you shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
21387,Homer,"for god's sakes, my little girl is--"
15478,Homer,really? what's it like?
26951,Homer,after everything i did you're going to abandon me?
25648,Homer,"no, lisa, but i sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
38285,Homer,she might marry someone like me? you think that would be bad!?
38947,Homer,"i know you are but what am i, infinity plus one! jinx!"
26342,Homer,"here's to a happy, well-rested marge!"
35957,Homer,"well, if there's one thing i don't like being taught, it's a lesson. i'm so mad. not only will i endorse ted nugent...but i will call for an end to the direct election of senators."
15575,Homer,i knew that.
40184,Homer,"be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
20605,Homer,seat belts?! pfft! they kill more people than they save.
30213,Homer,you have to cheat.
15678,Homer,"ah, sweet pity. where would my love life have been without it?"
18627,Homer,hey everybody! who thinks flanders should shut up?
21131,Homer,starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
40876,Homer,...but i am severely tempted to do it over this.
15552,Homer,i'll take that.
29588,Homer,"...bart was never kidnapped! lisa, i'm very glad you brought me this. i'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
40869,Homer,promise me.
25052,Homer,i wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
30692,Homer,"hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on daddy's boat!"
24259,Homer,"oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!"
33067,Homer,you ruin everything! /
40893,Homer,"all right, the stuff i stole from work!"
13826,Homer,"ok, ok. i'll make a wish that can't backfire. i wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and...and! i don't want any zombie turkeys, i don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and i don't want any other weird surprises. you got it?"
24478,Homer,ch-ch-ch-changes / time to change the oil / yeah / changes / don't wanna be an oily man /
21656,Homer,yay! / all right! / woo-hoo! /
38100,Homer,"uh... c'mon, boy. your job is to guide me."
14175,Homer,nobody loves you...
16388,Homer,"uh, i dunno. but lucky for you somebody here is responsible."
13939,Homer,you're looking for help?
39638,Homer,will somebody help her?
21292,Homer,flanders is playing? why didn't you say so?
30705,Homer,that is so sweet.
22235,Homer,"ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. so breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. but first, i'm afraid we have some bad news. the waffle bar is closed. i'm sorry. i'm so very--"
35248,Homer,okay. i'll go get some stuff.
36907,Homer,"prep, prep, prep..."
36264,Homer,we're the same temperature we've always been.
40991,Homer,"yeah, though the boy was a close call."
24403,Homer,the gi-ant...
38935,Homer,fine. but i'll be amazed if i'm astounded.
36915,Homer,"a minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! torture, torture, torture!"
25226,Homer,don't worry your spiky little head. i've got it all planned out.
21751,Homer,i promise you kids lots of things. that's what makes me such a good father.
22639,Homer,"oooh, here's something you'd like. ""when animals attack magicians."""
19444,Homer,follow... the... this must be why i'm here! follow the what? follow the what? hurry up!
21636,Homer,i did it! i'm gonna be rich!
19668,Homer,"now ms. bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. first, do you have any bad habits?"
18100,Homer,"c'mon, we're family."
17308,Homer,"hmm. fabulous house. well-behaved kids. sisters-in-law dead. luxury sedan. woo hoo! i hit the jackpot. marge, dear. would you kindly pass me a donut?"
30896,Homer,i don't know why i ever married that woman.
32155,Homer,i don't know. maybe we flew through a rainbow.
27606,Homer,the ribwich! the commercials have come to pass!
13410,Homer,to those weirdos in the worm store.
37417,Homer,woo hoo!
15977,Homer,"we'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. she's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons."
33553,Homer,i see--
15013,Homer,"hey ganesha, want a peanut?"
22664,Homer,oh yeah... art.
34628,Homer,can't talk! must text!
17785,Homer,you weren't complaining when i got you this close to chachi.
27865,Homer,"well, get used to it, 'cause i'm gonna stay."
19002,Homer,"""stay in school. your hero, homer."""
15213,Homer,"and that's good! but, here's the bad part... uh... uh... ooh, look at that headline: ""canada to hold referendum."" sorry marge, can't talk now."
24156,Homer,"i'm gonna call you lisa junior. so, what do you do for fun around here?"
31938,Homer,"oh, i can't wait for my first fire. is that one?"
29108,Homer,what about now?
19465,Homer,and that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
31699,Homer,"oh, spirit. are you gonna show me my future? my snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? well, it's not too late for me to change!"
16070,Homer,my first day of college. i wish my father was alive to see this.
35508,Homer,the warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
33014,Homer,"oh, wait. i left a sandwich in there."
15634,Homer,mmm... grapefruit.
32106,Homer,a fresh face!
27780,Homer,what are you doin'?
23058,Homer,"marge, they stole my idea!"
13981,Homer,"oooh, ""death by knockout,"" ""blood on the ice"" oh, oh... ""football's greatest injuries"". lisa, we're going."
21501,Homer,scary ways. but we never intended it to end like that. with thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
26440,Homer,can't keep it in...
29640,Homer,"people please, can we wrap this up? it's gonna rain and i've gotta get the bikes in here."
31420,Homer,he was following my design.
29775,Homer,bart! pull over!
39201,Homer,"hey, norman. how's it going? so you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. how ya doing, fred? excuse me, fred."
36645,Homer,oh god! it hurts worse than the burns!
34251,Homer,"uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... i spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, i didn't know you could rent a balloon..."
22607,Homer,"this is all your fault for trading away your turn. just for that, no dessert tonight!"
26895,Homer,jingle bell what?
15829,Homer,"oh, yeah."
17246,Homer,"when i'm driving the car, i get to choose the radio station. when you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
16183,Homer,"marge, you must hate me for not taking mr. burns' money."
33800,Homer,oscar wilde?
26311,Homer,i'm horny!
32375,Homer,"don't worry, son -- i've got a plan to save your space doggy."
25679,Homer,ahh... is that a fact? and you think you know someone.
38854,Homer,"lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. let's go."
32403,Homer,"because if i do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
23516,Homer,stop eating our future!
24915,Homer,wow.
35777,Homer,"i am really enjoying this, but, um... hello! meeting with the mayor?"
13606,Homer,we're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
40497,Homer,"ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god."
26610,Homer,"awww, look, maggie wants to fly too."
40723,Homer,"okay, just everybody remain calm."
16040,Homer,sorry. what am i thinking?
19302,Homer,"marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
34029,Homer,"hey carl, look how i messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. it's delicious! you know how smitty's name is smitty? well, not anymore -- i changed the ""m"" to a--"
31168,Homer,"marge, we've gotta get buck and tabitha back together. this is the most important case of our careers!"
23387,Homer,"thank you, sweet clown."
18322,Homer,mmm... unprocessed fish sticks.
19057,Homer,"yeah, yeah. i'll go feed it."
19990,Homer,"thanks for swinging by the house, reverend."
17431,Homer,thank you!
24605,Homer,not a single word of warning.
27170,Homer,domiciles for the destitute? is this that thing that jimmy carter does?
33333,Homer,"hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
33428,Homer,so you did learn something.
33997,Homer,better call dr. hibbert.
15861,Homer,"no, they weren't all happy days. like the time pinky tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night i lost all my money to those card sharks, and my dad, tom bosley, had to get it back."
28471,Homer,i'll audience you!
40337,Homer,well... he...
23947,Homer,there are no laws. we can do anything we want! anything!
34060,Homer,you wouldn't dare!
16991,Homer,"jump, free willy, jump! jump with all your might!"
39318,Homer,i'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
19078,Homer,"marge, marge! there i was, i had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when i was abducted by a flying saucer!"
38065,Homer,what's he doing?
41289,Homer,"well, i'll fix you. go drive a car!"
29814,Homer,"what happened to the guards?! okay, okay. don't panic. maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
41484,Homer,"oh marge, if only i knew what these paintings meant."
31684,Homer,why do you sound so shocked? this is our fifth take.
31663,Homer,"boy, i don't wanna freak you out, but i'm calling from inside the trunk."
39424,Homer,whoa! easy! don't drop me! be careful.
32468,Homer,"doctor, i'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. and it's all because of your surgery!"
21764,Homer,"oh yeah, couldn't put it down."
34385,Homer,here comes the butt!
24702,Homer,idiots.
27906,Homer,he's the man that i hate best / i'd like to see his house go up in flame!
29261,Homer,why don't you just kiss her?
17109,Homer,special present?! i don't wanna wait! i want it now! i want the children to see. oh. right. later.
37718,Homer,the editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
38658,Homer,my ears are burning.
20964,Homer,bo-ring!
28931,Homer,"whatever. the important thing is to get skinner to that altar. because once a union has been sanctified by god, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
27506,Homer,"oh heavenly god, my son is plagued with homework. with your vast knowledge of the shore birds of maryland, i know you can help him."
25103,Homer,"oh, i hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
38276,Homer,then that makes me the jackie robinson of the sport. and you are the racist philadelphia manager!
36779,Homer,"a paper-based read-a-majig? what are we, cavemen?"
22134,Homer,"you've gotta snap out of this funk, mayor. i'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters."
16663,Homer,"don't be alarmed, apu. just go about your daily routine like i'm not wearing the hat."
21436,Homer,"i know, but let me get you started first."
15711,Homer,i'm trying to knock you out.
23328,Homer,"oh. well, i'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
23581,Homer,i 'unno... because you weren't cute anymore?
35738,Homer,the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
40132,Homer,"motivated seller, marge."
19956,Homer,two in a row!
39976,Homer,smooth as a baby's behind.
30970,Homer,"i'm so bored, i figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats."
24152,Homer,"hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?"
34172,Homer,"oh bart, you say that now. but when you're grown up, you'll just think it. now you stay here and i'll get your sister."
36881,Homer,they're necessary! they're necessary!
39518,Homer,"so you had a little scuffle, eh? hope you won."
22446,Homer,for all of us. look.
16720,Homer,"marge, lisa, lady -- if you'll excuse me, i've got something very important to attend to."
33785,Homer,"hey, how hard can it be? all we have to do is follow the directions."
24508,Homer,"hello, mister lobster."
36573,Homer,"ooh, i can't wait for tonight's massacre."
22111,Homer,hey! i called that! i saw it first! come back here!
30682,Homer,"so, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
30519,Homer,"sorry, bart!"
19205,Homer,gotcha.
41419,Homer,quit makin' cracks.
21582,Homer,not the way i quit. ooh-who.
29773,Homer,"oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! they've stolen a car and they're home alone."
37613,Homer,"lisa, i've never prayed to a city in my life, and if i did, it would be hershey, pennsylvania. i was kneeling on the affirmation rug they gave me."
40291,Homer,"... some may say that i have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as i leave for capital city, i consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth!"
16939,Homer,oooh. he card reads good.
16273,Homer,"oh lisa, haven't you seen ""home alone?"" if some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
28997,Homer,"all i wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava."
25456,Homer,dancin' away my hunger pangs / movin' my feet so my stomach won't hurt / i'm kinda like jesus / but not in a sacrilegious way...
35326,Homer,i forgot why i'm doing this.
28512,Homer,"i don't need her, i've got you, astrolabe."
21607,Homer,"okay, we own 'em."
14785,Homer,will you knock it off! i can't hear myself think.
29610,Homer,"hey, what can i say? i love love."
30563,Homer,i can't believe i lost after ben affleck campaigned day and night for me.
29739,Homer,"well, i'll get a lawyer on that. no, a whole team of lawyers. who will dine on mustard flown in from the orient."
24505,Homer,why you little...!
34651,Homer,marge! no! stop packing your--
40474,Homer,"amen! well, bart, has dr. hibbert made his point?"
16857,Homer,"hi, mom."
29567,Homer,lousy american-made dog!
36992,Homer,i've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
37768,Homer,kids blow up so fast.
19462,Homer,a ghost train! and so little time to get out of the way!... now less!... now none!
33724,Homer,"i held up two, for ""peely!"""
24012,Homer,possessions are fleeting.
29786,Homer,"look, we'll compromise. we'll go see a play...that lisa doesn't want to see."
40904,Homer,"yeah, at the worst possible time."
25012,Homer,"thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting."
18307,Homer,did not.
32547,Homer,"dad, i can't remember what i did last night. do you have any idea?"
40082,Homer,what? our anniversary? are you sure?
35254,Homer,"looks like it's up to me. let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ..."
15680,Homer,"""i'm married to the sea,"" ""i don't want to kill you, but i will--"
35304,Homer,"how many more, sir?"
21310,Homer,"gym? what's a ""gym?"""
19173,Homer,really?
15943,Homer,"now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. you can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out."
18903,Homer,"let's all calm down. everyone's going to be just fine, as long as i've got enough beer."
17002,Homer,"or, if not then, christmas."
22233,Homer,"sure. sock it to me, baby."
23749,Homer,no dice!
16446,Homer,"yeah, good."
16700,Homer,"okay, apu, i accept your apology."
39160,Homer,what the?
19365,Homer,shut up!!
32048,Homer,"i like that. but i'm on a bit of a health kick, so i'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: snickles, gooey bears, charlottesville chew, nice 'n' many, kat kit, herschel's smooches, mrs. bad bar, and milk dudes."
38499,Homer,we're on an old-time boat!
15808,Homer,"ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god."
17590,Homer,"not as such, no."
19785,Homer,oh yeah?! how long since you've had a baby?
21241,Homer,woo hoo!
21229,Homer,"what am i, the answer man? just vote for me."
31590,Homer,"so, that's our story. oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. he turned out to be pretty cool."
40202,Homer,"uh... uh yes, sir."
20852,Homer,"fine. it's not important. what really matters is my title. i think i'll make myself vice president. no, wait... junior vice president."
15484,Homer,"hey, i'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
31592,Homer,which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?
29626,Homer,"now patty, here's a veil i picked out just for you."
14265,Homer,"marge, for you."
28935,Homer,"okay, fat load here."
17726,Homer,how about if i triple the business? then could i get a raise?
28221,Homer,there's coffee in the thermos.

22048,Homer,"um, can i be a mate on your ship? preferably first mate."
27079,Homer,are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!
28764,Homer,"so our kids keep getting smarter! if we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."

23645,Homer,"hey, there's someone else in here."
37112,Homer,we've won. woo hoo.
17004,Homer,"marge, please. old people don't need companionship. they need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
18020,Homer,two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? gimme the ticket.
37807,Homer,but n-n-n-nurture...

19330,Homer,"lisa, wait! i know you're only eight years old and i don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage."

19519,Homer,"i'm telling you, i saw a creature from another planet."
13274,Homer,"wait a second! i'm in jail because of you! you were my friend, and you betrayed me."
21314,Homer,"wow, wolfie. two months ago i didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. this place is great."

25179,Homer,"not now, honey. daddy's busy."
18888,Homer,"c'mon, maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little..."
29008,Homer,"ah, that's better. so why do they call this place niagara falls anyway?"
16016,Homer,woo hoo!
33628,Homer,maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. and that would be a big surprise because i'd forget about it pretty quick.
28608,Homer,pretended.
30195,Homer,"and if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the army. where you'll be sent straight to america's latest military quagmire. where will it be? north korea? iran? anything's possible with commander cuckoo bananas in charge."
32754,Homer,"yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
39756,Homer,"i wanted to surprise you. i couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could i?"
32884,Homer,i'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!

23268,Homer,"no, it usually takes a few hours."
30260,Homer,when will you be back?
22631,Homer,"bart, stop squeaking your chair!"
23191,Homer,"oh, i'm sorry i ruined your career, mel."
29575,Homer,"boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
16395,Homer,"oh pardon me, mr. let's ration everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? don't you know the poem? ""water, water everywhere/ so let's all have a drink."""
30633,Homer,"all right, bob. we won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car."
38378,Homer,"come on, buddy. just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
34340,Homer,"i've got to apologize. once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
35865,Homer,"your dad may be a little immature, but i know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance."
15137,Homer,if you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.

31802,Homer,"first amendment rules, privacy drools!"
36963,Homer,"well, i've taken eight months off. it's time to get back on the horse."
29618,Homer,"please, kent. call me your holiness."
35090,Homer,because you've been such a great kid lately and i wanted to show you i appreciated it.
35001,Homer,poor tony. he didn't deserve this. he was just a soldier in a war he started.
25263,Homer,"yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over."
37895,Homer,"wow, that was easy! all i had to do was click on--"
16851,Homer,"stop it! stop it! stop it! how dare you talk about ned flanders like that! he's a wonderful, kind, caring man. maybe even more so than me. there have been times when i've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. but this man has turned every cheek on his body. if everyone here were like ned flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. we'd already be there."
22243,Homer,ow!
29447,Homer,"great news, honey! burns made me a freelance consultant!"
26466,Homer,"sure, i said i loved him. but never that i was ""in love"" with him."
24138,Homer,"great, but why am i on a plane?"
20074,Homer,they sure are.
41583,Homer,where's bongo? is he still at the crazy lady's...
17705,Homer,"hey, wait a minute. what are all these presents? it looks like you're ""showering"" marge with gifts."

18111,Homer,"hey herman, i had to come out here to see what's so funny - a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! i'm gonna tell everyone! wait here."
15307,Homer,stop!
35887,Homer,"you can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! and why is there moisture between the windows?! and don't wake me up to land! just land!"
17533,Homer,where? where?
22341,Homer,"'scuse me, comin' through. friends of dan marino."

25534,Homer,the customer's always right. that's what everybody likes about us. now mush!
16710,Homer,"rock! rock! rock! rock-a, rock, rock! rockarockrock!"
39606,Homer,does it have a deep fryer?
13501,Homer,"uh, uh i-i guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
15497,Homer,"gee, thanks, guys."
34616,Homer,cartoons! everybody be quiet!
15135,Homer,he's the boy you love to hate.
18400,Homer,vent radioactive gas?... y-e-s.
17638,Homer,"you know, i think you guys are lettin' me win."

18539,Homer,"no it doesn't, it's funny. their clothes are different from my clothes. look at what they're wearin'."
21513,Homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
33688,Homer,"here we are, maggie. that park you love..."
26901,Homer,"all right, but not the imported."

36503,Homer,wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
16360,Homer,"""honey roasted peanuts. ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" mmmmm."
31212,Homer,"boy, get dressed. you're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!"

27064,Homer,"oh, i don't resent you, sweetheart. what i was trying to say, and maybe i didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
23087,Homer,"well, i haven't talked it over with the family, but i think we'd all like a free dinner at americatown."
32653,Homer,"we didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."

39009,Homer,"oh my god! brace yourselves, family. we're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. boy, get me my baseball bat."
32370,Homer,crème brûlée! crème brûlée! or in english: burnt cream! burnt cream!

22620,Homer,"hey, this is pretty comfortable. that andy capp was onto something."
31012,Homer,which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
32457,Homer,"kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
27705,Homer,aren't you gonna chuckle?
18172,Homer,"hey, didn't you direct ""unnatural discretion""?"

39582,Homer,"hey, that kid's pretty good."
37741,Homer,"okay, okay, no worries."
40949,Homer,"what is it, da --"
14638,Homer,"i know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and i hate you."
27824,Homer,"aww, marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. the fake business card i made up to impress her..."
32616,Homer,when you ask me that it's never good.
24998,Homer,we'll be safe here.
36957,Homer,real matuuure!
23149,Homer,"okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. it'll let us see your playful side."

14327,Homer,"that's all i can stands, i can't stands no more. i'm gonna get you outta there myself."
16839,Homer,okay. but at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
30708,Homer,"as i lay dying on the ocean floor, i remembered everything you've done for me. to hell with that stupid dna test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and i love you."
32391,Homer,blueberries!

35590,Homer,oh my god! she's still on the first sentence! must make her stop... how to express my...
33558,Homer,"kids, i have to tell your mom i lost maggie."
37792,Homer,i was talking about myself in the third person.
24983,Homer,"a singing rubber fish, of course."
21942,Homer,don't make me come up there!
38057,Homer,ten minute rule.
20557,Homer,"hey, i'm trying to eat here. beat it, pegleg!"

16957,Homer,you idiot! he was the most talented one!
29964,Homer,"doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. they're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
25615,Homer,look out for the reach-around!
24963,Homer,"oh, that's it! you can walk home!"
30265,Homer,"kids, i'm sure your mother will be back soon."
39818,Homer,"oh, moe. my wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture."

16266,Homer,will you bring me back something?
15568,Homer,"don't hassle the dead, boy. they have eerie powers."
22863,Homer,"hey, ray j. johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been."
21982,Homer,"relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. enjoy your day at the beach! ooh, look."
27596,Homer,"finally, someone explains it to me in words i can understand. look, boy. i know i did wrong and i am truly sorry."
13710,Homer,yeah.
35820,Homer,"let's see, my family gives me love and sex. my work gives me money and sleep..."
38982,Homer,"bye, bart. stay ten forever."

14291,Homer,"aw, ain't that cute... hey!"

22122,Homer,"oh my god, i killed the mayor. all right, stay calm. i'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""weekend at bernie's,"" and..."
36826,Homer,beer keg do-nut?
36404,Homer,"man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."

15517,Homer,"woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!"
24736,Homer,"first comes love, then comes, um... dammit, i know this."

30215,Homer,"celibacy?! i was talking about the meat on friday thing. man, you guys got more crazy rules than blockbuster video."
36817,Homer,they're gone!
31381,Homer,moe's the princess of lollipop land! he lunches on lavender and potpourri!
35924,Homer,"you all know i'm a big fan of american meat. although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
36271,Homer,i got it...
17094,Homer,i'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
14871,Homer,all right... but i never really hugged a man before.

25009,Homer,"thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... is that everyone?"
25498,Homer,but i'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare maggie away.
25464,Homer,"oh, i'm so hungry. oh, why keep starving myself? no one cares."
20972,Homer,we'll tape it!

28190,Homer,it was those guys!
34929,Homer,we're gonna go out for breakfast / we'll go out to eat / it'll be any place you choose / as long as it's run by jews / 'cause they don't think this holiday's so great.
37746,Homer,"oh, he was just here."
36979,Homer,"yeah, but i'll go home, weigh myself, and i'll have gained six pounds. what's that about?"
31407,Homer,"hey marge, want a thousand dollars?"
38116,Homer,"young lady, in my day..."

34686,Homer,"oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--"
22064,Homer,"all right, this is it. no more living in shame. i'm going to show my family the kind of man i really am."
24025,Homer,did that really happen? or was it just a wonderful dream?
41384,Homer,...magazines.

27696,Homer,"oh, no! that's maggie's mix tape! then maggie must have gotten..."

14669,Homer,"marge, i have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. tonight you robbed me of it. i'm going now and i don't know when you'll see me again."
23734,Homer,"oh, that's sweet."
24294,Homer,"wait a minute, barney. you gotta be sober to fly. i mean, it's not like drivin' a car."

14689,Homer,i was just up at this bar in spittle county.
28341,Homer,"your honor, i've completely disappointed my wife. that's punishment enough. you understand these things, you're a grandmother."
35842,Homer,"wow, i can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!"
40362,Homer,"stay, stay. good dog. now, keep your head down."
33354,Homer,"exception that proves the rule. if losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. watch, i'll prove it."
21564,Homer,cold.
19813,Homer,"and sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"

22174,Homer,"geez, flanders. you're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
37484,Homer,what the hell is this?
21493,Homer,"okay, i think i've figured this thing out. it can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
27518,Homer,i can't see anything in this fog.

22030,Homer,but i don't want that.
18113,Homer,"herman, how could you? we've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? hard working designers, like calvin klein, gloria vanderbilt, or antoine bugle boy. these are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
21905,Homer,"look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. c'mon, where's your freak bus?"
14642,Homer,oh he's gone and he's never coming back. wait! there he is. no... that's a horse.

41091,Homer,"my god, you're right, marge. you kids wouldn't put me in a home like i did to my dad, would you?"
29438,Homer,sure it will. all we need is a pilot!
40129,Homer,wait a minute. let's see what the kids are up to.
31291,Homer,"nag, nag, nag."
34311,Homer,"c'est la vie, baby."
18934,Homer,"no, marge. apu convinced me that proposition 24 is a big mistake."
25964,Homer,"oh, i just naturally assumed."

27019,Homer,fine.
18578,Homer,"uh... excuse me, mr. burns?"
38761,Homer,not me. i'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
37029,Homer,"this is the easiest money i've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
14812,Homer,disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! a pox on them!
40690,Homer,ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.

13880,Homer,i ordered it for my little girl. heh... heh.
27828,Homer,"hey, there's writing on the back of this."
33653,Homer,"i'm not sure what happened. i was kidnapped, then tortured, then i fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. when i awoke, i felt refreshed. then i was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn."
24435,Homer,that's what we've been trying to tell you.
40583,Homer,"no, no, no. you think this is about money? well, it's not. it's worse, marge. i'm afraid that from now on when i look at you, i'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. i'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
32606,Homer,"listen carefully. i have taken your wife hostage. if you don't have a wife, i have kidnapped your brother. nod if you understand."
28707,Homer,"all right, we're back to square one. put on some coffee."
24358,Homer,"okay, flanders, your love quiz score is 61. that makes you a ""frigid frieda."" i took off thirty points for all that crying you did."
28804,Homer,"that's it. it's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin."
30289,Homer,"i warned you he was an idiot. well, all i need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and i'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
39236,Homer,"hello, flanders."
24168,Homer,"yes, boy?"
17407,Homer,"okay. say, can you introduce me to the sasquatch? i like his style."
16647,Homer,"don't forget to say ""i didn't do it""."
15565,Homer,what?
18823,Homer,which one's itchy? the car?
37270,Homer,"help me, flanders!"
34867,Homer,already?
33168,Homer,how about r?

36843,Homer,terence shaved my head!
41077,Homer,this is not happening! this is not happening!
38355,Homer,"well, better get home. the delightfulness ended hours ago."
20348,Homer,only if you clean your room.
23869,Homer,that had nothing to do with the bucket.
23828,Homer,mops? the cure sounds worse than the disease.
17579,Homer,i saw weird stuff in that place last night. weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. and i want in.
27727,Homer,"hmm. what next, megatronics? ""point out problems at your workplace to your boss. to separate yourself from the herd, just tattle on the cattle. hm."
29126,Homer,to date!
24492,Homer,"our favorite show was ""hollywood hogwash."" but we also loved ""the dreck squad""..."
20929,Homer,i gotta find another way to wreck moe's car!
30669,Homer,"oh, it's just what i wanted. here, marge, this is for you."
18868,Homer,"okay, your turn."
23476,Homer,"sorry, boy. going back to springfield would be a coward's way out."
17878,Homer,and who could forget dear rat boy?
19949,Homer,you mean maggie?
33801,Homer,but that makes no sense!
36217,Homer,"look at it go! all right! hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town."
35936,Homer,"eh, maybe i'll vote democrat. the great thing is when they get in they act like republicans."
14449,Homer,how often should i change maggie?
16992,Homer,i don't like this new director's cut.
15254,Homer,"hey, hey, hey!"
19795,Homer,"yep, and it's your shot, son."
16972,Homer,that is true.
38729,Homer,i did a lick?
29648,Homer,is there a chance for advancement?
15106,Homer,did you raise the dead?
26833,Homer,are you sure god doesn't want it to be dead?
27868,Homer,"marge, please. let's not fight in front of the kids. just secretly hate me the way you always have."
21145,Homer,"ohh, we're never gonna make it. let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
34116,Homer,"yeah. it sounded like naked bacon to me. i don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, tom."
29506,Homer,'cause i want a sandwich
37965,Homer,why didn't i stop with the snake wine? why did i drink the fish wine?
40584,Homer,"i'm saying... she's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. i'm not sure i love you anymore."
14904,Homer,and where exactly are you going?
27695,Homer,"well, my special mix tape will get you going."
36405,Homer,"...and now because it's afternoon, i can go to moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
17788,Homer,stop it! you're killing me! seattle...
23076,Homer,"hey, that's mine!"
22571,Homer,"uh-oh. here's your slingshot, lisa."

30068,Homer,i'll take everything you've got!
24665,Homer,"wow, the who!"
33957,Homer,"hm, i don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
29708,Homer,i am so sorry about what happened. but at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
29782,Homer,"wow, marge -- once again, your mom-ly wisdom averted disaster."
32579,Homer,noooo!

15222,Homer,"oh, man, i really gotta..."
40115,Homer,"yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- i can save this company millions of dollars a year. how? through jiko kanri, the japanese art of self-management. you see, in the west... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
16309,Homer,huh?
40837,Homer,it's funny 'cause it's true!
16093,Homer,really? but nerds are my mortal enemy.

15266,Homer,"..._______ calendar? hmm... ooh, mostly mozart is in town."
19286,Homer,"don't you worry, son."
29146,Homer,"now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. but you can't spell u.s.a. without us... eh?"
30703,Homer,daddy... daddy...
40485,Homer,"look, i know i can't stop you. the only thing i can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
38524,Homer,turn right here. i keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
19046,Homer,"you've got friends. you got ""the dud"" right here. stand up for yourself, poindexter!"
39289,Homer,what are the odds on santa's little helper?
36752,Homer,now what?
17363,Homer,"no, wait! i love lisa!"
17010,Homer,"now, what you gotta do / if you want to get a kiss / is act real smooth / and make your move like this."
39276,Homer,wait a minute...
27336,Homer,"hey skinner! do you and edna want to join marge and me at ""great moments with mr. eisner""?"
13963,Homer,that baby changed our lives.
32336,Homer,"chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!"
25882,Homer,that's my boy...
16523,Homer,huh? wuh? lisa? what's up?
31451,Homer,"i made it back for your show, honey..."
17953,Homer,"marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
23056,Homer,"yeah, isn't it amazing? they're filming one right now in the bathroom."
18278,Homer,"lisa! lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father i am!"
38478,Homer,i thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
23521,Homer,"i know, honey. but what can i do, as an individual? i wouldn't know where to begin."
40339,Homer,"okay, okay. it wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!"
30287,Homer,"oh, the rubiest. ooh look! a new restaurant chain!"
32065,Homer,"i'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. you can stay. but you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our wall of casual acquaintances who came to stay for a while."
25690,Homer,"i'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other godly hoo-hah."
19853,Homer,"c'mon, boy, think of a plan."
23537,Homer,"oh, i'm twenty-six hours late for work. no time for maggie."
26288,Homer,"that guy is freaky. well, here's your sugar."
23150,Homer,"yeah, but..."
41245,Homer,"oh man, i've really got to go to the bathroom. why did i have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?"
22795,Homer,"but, marge, i'm not like other men. that's why you buy my pants at that special store."
38777,Homer,"backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass."
34633,Homer,"marge, this is crazy!"
14803,Homer,"lose weight and listen to new-age music? wow! what do you think, marge?"
22070,Homer,"i'm sorry i ran off again. oh, i guess dad must be dead by now. when i get better, and after i've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave..."
27616,Homer,"not again! first you took away my philly fudge steak, and then my bacon balls, then my whatcha-ma-chicken. you monster!"
29947,Homer,what day?
40992,Homer,what's to know? just dive in. catch!
27107,Homer,"my dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. i was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. i'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
29046,Homer,honorable men can differ. now what brings you down here?
16798,Homer,"if anyone can pull it off, it's stan ""the boy"" taylor."
41131,Homer,"so, have you figured out who gets the money?"
17413,Homer,not with that attitude.
14956,Homer,"let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
40194,Homer,i'll mutant you.
29071,Homer,"please forgive me, talking llama."
27435,Homer,"no, no worries. this is what all those hours of playing tetris were for."
36067,Homer,"you know what's great about you, marge? after all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
15530,Homer,do you want to change your name to homer junior? the kids can call you hoju!
15491,Homer,sorry.
34977,Homer,that's so mean!
21729,Homer,bor-ing.
27969,Homer,"get out, and stay out."
36346,Homer,spoiler!
15217,Homer,marge what're you doing? it's lunch time.
30274,Homer,"of course i have call waiting, you idiot! i just never learned how to use it!"
19986,Homer,put it in! put it in!
40556,Homer,whiplash! oh no!
16724,Homer,inanimate huh? i'll show him inanimate!
27494,Homer,"well, since i don't have the remote, i can just get up and change the channel."
33302,Homer,"marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
37989,Homer,but the avatar looks just like you!
30990,Homer,"man, that bird did it all. good guy."
24986,Homer,suckers.
16598,Homer,why you monster! and you have my daughter's saxophone too!
24380,Homer,par-ty!
39376,Homer,"you'll get that punk someday, moe."
23309,Homer,"ah, not bad... if lasagna is italian for ""pile of puke."""
37471,Homer,baby... i'm going for us. that money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
36790,Homer,which of you is the youtube of the kid high on dentist's gas? is it you? is it you? is it you?
31237,Homer,"you sure are, sweetie -- i love this bed you made."
18894,Homer,"oh, don't worry, maggie! i'll think of something!"
27781,Homer,i don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. i don't even want it.
34984,Homer,yeah. those guys are probably fbi informants.
32993,Homer,"here you go, son. shell casings."
35490,Homer,"and didn't the easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" and if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and edna can find a way to make it work."
37295,Homer,"marge, this is amazing. i never realized some restaurants are better than others."
28766,Homer,"your mother's right, honey. katie couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
32399,Homer,"marge, give me a break! i don't notice the color of people's eyes! i just judge them on the color of their skin."
41111,Homer,"oh dad. oh, i knew you'd forgive me."
16333,Homer,"see, marge?"
37655,Homer,"trying to kill moe so we'll get his emerald. by the way, i haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
25085,Homer,that motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. like this...
31928,Homer,because i'm filled with stress!
25387,Homer,i get it. everything's made of blocks. even the water.
37108,Homer,"i've got a bone to pick with you! then, an apology to make. then, we exchange insurance information. then, more bone picking!"
27275,Homer,"mmm, steamed gentile."
41468,Homer,what do you know?
32217,Homer,i said you look hot! hot! ay chihuahua!
38599,Homer,ha! i gotcha!
19293,Homer,take it off!
41236,Homer,"""special day?"" oh, what have i forgotten now? now, don't panic... is it bacon day? no, that's crazy talk... she's getting impatient, take a stab at it."
31221,Homer,"not if i can help it, lisa!"
15336,Homer,i don't know.
34192,Homer,"i is! oooh, what a lucky man i is! boo-weee-boo-weee-wee-doo-doo-dee-dee-doo-doo"
32665,Homer,"yep, that professor couldn't keep me and marge apart."
28555,Homer,"give daddy the remote, maggie. give daddy the..."
15164,Homer,"bart, didn't i ask you to watch maggie?"
36953,Homer,crawling... so painful...
15672,Homer,what? that's highway robbery! i won't pay it!
22528,Homer,how the hell should i know? just get in this cage.
38185,Homer,"not your fault, man. those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
34131,Homer,"hmm, while i'm up there..."
39880,Homer,give me the old stars and stripes.
17418,Homer,i don't have a friend in the world.
40880,Homer,"huh? hey, how'd you get in here?"
30595,Homer,"listen, marge. no matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul."
18285,Homer,"there it is! the chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat southern sheriffs!"""
15245,Homer,"shut up, you little monsters! hello, i was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
37014,Homer,hm. i cut the wires to something.
27226,Homer,"it's not a time machine, moe."
18527,Homer,yabba dabba doo!
38944,Homer,yes you are.
37618,Homer,"anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken."
24465,Homer,"what are you talking about, professor frink? they're clearly in the ""on"" position. see? ""on."""
16412,Homer,according to this map there's a krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
36660,Homer,"ha, of course i do! happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?"
22518,Homer,let's roll.
36293,Homer,and his arm can be my back-scratcher.
23496,Homer,a sprout!
35535,Homer,"that's funny, because i have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
35171,Homer,"hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
28495,Homer,"oh god, it's so unnecessary!"
20328,Homer,"oh, i don't need anything like that - yet. just gimme my gun."
41143,Homer,"four hundred and thirty-seven. fifty-five. oh my god, three hundred and... hey, a hundred and fifty. oh god, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! i'm a big fat pig."
14562,Homer,"well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
37824,Homer,you used to be fun.
15460,Homer,"now let me tell you something, mr. sucker... i just..."
19077,Homer,no! no! what are you spraying me with!?
21654,Homer,"no, but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home..."
31817,Homer,how do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?
37971,Homer,i hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
32486,Homer,bingo!
19307,Homer,boring!
34836,Homer,"it may not be a boy. it could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the santa fe lifestyle. just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
40152,Homer,not to worry. i'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
37310,Homer,i like that picture of the sneaker with wings. i'm gonna flee!
31423,Homer,you kids like ice cream?
27163,Homer,"bart, is that you?"
37609,Homer,"i missed my flight so i got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. they wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, i had the ass."
19479,Homer,"well what about you, lenny?"
33600,Homer,we are so screwed!
33765,Homer,gotta be something from earth.
13227,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's!"
25751,Homer,peek-a-boo!
37187,Homer,there's always a catch.
33908,Homer,some hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!
22482,Homer,"and then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. but the evil ogre, barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. so the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
18672,Homer,"oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
25487,Homer,noooo!
27846,Homer,"oh, so you don't like it when i drink. what other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
28810,Homer,"c'mon, little fella. you're hangin' with me tonight."
24770,Homer,"just give the word, and i'll cut him off."
24114,Homer,done and done.
34539,Homer,the simpsons are off the grid! and so far it's going great!
35516,Homer,"no, a guy at work seems not to like me. i guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
32691,Homer,"son, i know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. but since then, i've really come to respect you. and unlike love, respect can't be bought."
21376,Homer,"hmm. so you want to take the bus, huh? i don't know. that's a pretty big decision..."
34899,Homer,enough chitchat. time for operation dog dump.
38088,Homer,what the--
22705,Homer,piece o' cake. just need a little truck-driving music.
15639,Homer,"well, there's... jerry, the cowboy. and that big dipper-looking thing is alan... the cowboy."
22621,Homer,"just pretend it's a tree, honey. or as we say at omnitouch, a progress tree."
32308,Homer,"and if elected president of our small community, i will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay."
24091,Homer,but don't take my word for it. listen to this testimonial.
18236,Homer,no.
23960,Homer,you too.
40167,Homer,"listen, you big stupid space creature. nobody, but nobody eats the simpsons."
17253,Homer,"hmm. i don't agree with his bart-killing policy, but i do approve of his selma-killing policy."
28735,Homer,i want to get a second house. closer to work.
35556,Homer,this is no way to treat the talent!
25929,Homer,"hey, marge, surf's up!"
39464,Homer,"you think so, huh? well, there's only one way to find out. follow me."
36071,Homer,the old homestead. remember when we moved in and i talked like this?
27345,Homer,here!
14453,Homer,"so, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. just you and me."
19445,Homer,"get moving, you stupid... when i'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". come on!"
34181,Homer,togasaki-rothman!
24051,Homer,my bad.
24437,Homer,arizona smells funny.
33503,Homer,it was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
37813,Homer,you want me to take care of your dolly?
39981,Homer,they all look so tasty. but i think i'll eat this one right there.
20808,Homer,"come again, marge?"
30340,Homer,butter face.
19332,Homer,"as you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and i think your mom might not be happy with me."
33764,Homer,too obvious.
20793,Homer,homer no function beer well without.
28492,Homer,"first we'll buy gifts for each other. then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
14710,Homer,i did bad in school.
33438,Homer,"i'm not in good hands! i'm in no hands! like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
39845,Homer,"look, i'm here because i want to apologize for treating you like an object."
24784,Homer,i liked when i threw the pudding.
28769,Homer,that's me. huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
22019,Homer,"a kidney? okay, fine."
31172,Homer,it's working! buck's buying my fake message! and you said it would never work.
37481,Homer,we did it!
28579,Homer,what do i care?
37852,Homer,"global warming, huh? by pure coincidence, every scientist was right!"
32077,Homer,i'm afraid they might. but i will not be silenced. the truth is...
32731,Homer,"i'm lord evilton from the ""angelica button"" books."
15859,Homer,"""activities, none. sports, none. honors, none."" so many memories."
19975,Homer,"volunteering is for suckers! do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"
25752,Homer,okay. is that all there is? / is that all there is? / if that's all there is / my friend / then let's keep dancing...
13616,Homer,"sweetheart, there's nothing i wouldn't do for that magazine."
21332,Homer,i am?
21492,Homer,"grab onto the handles, marge."
25312,Homer,maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
13874,Homer,no.
15252,Homer,all you can eat. all you can eat.
15481,Homer,"uh, yeah."
20350,Homer,"you couldn't be more wrong, lisa. if i didn't have this gun, the king of england could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. do you want that? huh? do you?"
39958,Homer,"gee, a romantic evening. nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
30170,Homer,last-diddily-ast? he's gone! and it's all someone's fault!
31115,Homer,poor bambi... poor thumper...
37911,Homer,"superintendent chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same hawaiian shirt to that luau!"
28466,Homer,"y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."
34820,Homer,"no child of mine will go without anything, ever! except quality healthcare!"
26506,Homer,stupid king of troy. i think i speak for all the greeks when i say this war has gone on for too long.
35137,Homer,stupid kid. all you do is cost me money. money i could be wasting!
15339,Homer,hmm...
17593,Homer,what?
34832,Homer,just don't dress me up like a woman.
26003,Homer,cecil is a girl's name.
23700,Homer,i don't know how.
27521,Homer,it's all good.
38624,Homer,oh baby...
20114,Homer,"they expect me to sit here from nine to five?! that's how many hours? ten, eleven, denominator... oh, where's lisa when you need her?"
33738,Homer,"oh, come on, relax, i won't embarrass you."
20188,Homer,yeah.
25939,Homer,"look at her in there, washing her body..."
16516,Homer,this late? through the bad neighborhood?
34319,Homer,no problem. you can unload.
23686,Homer,not any more!
18985,Homer,"oh, i get it."
30070,Homer,"marge, the rapture is nigh. these books will help me figure out how nigh."
36901,Homer,you're hel-come!
30960,Homer,i'm not a god. god has a white beard and invented the da vinci code.
32156,Homer,i drove a car over a cliff once. how different could it be?
14031,Homer,"i'm not pouting, you are."
14628,Homer,"whattaya got, marge? insurance scam?"
22157,Homer,"don rickles zinged you, marge."
26940,Homer,green vegetables and homework.
18126,Homer,"pile in, everybody! no time to wipe your feet!"
35264,Homer,tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!
34372,Homer,i could kiss you.
19324,Homer,"oh, and for yourself."
22583,Homer,"ah, give me a minute..."
22956,Homer,"good luck, mr. burns. and if you get in trouble, i wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
40983,Homer,"that's okay, carry on. see the way i handled that, marge?"
35635,Homer,can one of the hundred be making the list?
19893,Homer,poor wiggum.
33527,Homer,we'll be talking about this together for years!
15475,Homer,"well, marge, we could do worse."
34768,Homer,oh baby. let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
30125,Homer,uh-oh.
23561,Homer,woo hoo!
31244,Homer,it's allll good.
39051,Homer,nothing.
39119,Homer,"hey, marge. i'm supposed to help drive the kids? oh, man, i wish i knew that sooner, but i just had a beer."
36697,Homer,what?!
16820,Homer,"hiya, flanders! oooh... dinner! may i join you?"
19576,Homer,"that's right, lenny. let's all give in to deliciousness, the pretzel wagon way."
18144,Homer,"that's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now marge?"
29519,Homer,i know why you're here. you wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. well fine.
39603,Homer,oooh! credit.
31396,Homer,"and we went to the ""vermont teddy bear"" factory. look what we got! hm? hm?"
18775,Homer,"uh, smithers already left, sir. i'm his replacement, homer simpson."
14089,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
25567,Homer,"i've got more bones than that guy. if you're trying to impress me, you've failed."
38644,Homer,"we'd better send the dog down. come on. here's your chance to protect us, boy. come on."
17931,Homer,"please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
16583,Homer,"hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?"
38366,Homer,"wow. i've gotta take that in. while i do, have some bar nuts."
36647,Homer,"i put it in the bank. that place is great! on their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
16010,Homer,"if you don't mind, we're trying to watch the mov..."
26135,Homer,did you really make that envelope? 'cause it says hammermill over here.
24995,Homer,"oh, of course, of course. it's just that..."
23409,Homer,to the top please.
29550,Homer,"flanders. eh, i guess you've got some late night problems too."
34041,Homer,"honey, i know it's been a rough couple of weeks. but i booked us a night this saturday, at a very romantic hotel."
23375,Homer,"geez, marge, tell the neighborhood."
17157,Homer,oh sugar!
18889,Homer,"that's it, that's it, i..."
26983,Homer,"go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
13894,Homer,buh.
19810,Homer,"he said ""tried""!"
39056,Homer,what are you doing?
27375,Homer,priceless.
19275,Homer,"what the... ""president eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... not pictured: mrs. eisenhower."""
30959,Homer,you're giving me absolute power?!
39470,Homer,it's worse than you think. i just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
39116,Homer,i'm not spending my precious saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than i ever had.
40231,Homer,"""you know, mr. burns, my family and i feel that taxes are too high. where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"""
29097,Homer,whuh-oh.
24584,Homer,"it was her, all right. take the one who wronged you."
32819,Homer,"yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
34688,Homer,okay.
27821,Homer,"or when i messed up taping ""city slickers 2"" and cut off the end. was curly's gold just a legend?"
29784,Homer,"marge, you're taking this pretty well."
15158,Homer,how could you let this happen?
38503,Homer,you're my son and you will hate what i hate. angled parking. lemons. kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. and this boat!
30369,Homer,"aw, poor maggie."
27351,Homer,"eh, it's still better than indian food."
36674,Homer,did you say my dad worked here?
39999,Homer,i don't like the looks of this.
23793,Homer,i want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
16834,Homer,they're fine.
33011,Homer,there he is!
27224,Homer,who wants to eat a loser?
41147,Homer,"this old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. i said, isn't it, boy?"
40457,Homer,series?!
22098,Homer,clear!
27195,Homer,"shut up, boy."
22613,Homer,relax. i'm just boning up on the ol' constitution.
19515,Homer,yaaaa...

31521,Homer,we're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!
17291,Homer,"fine. as long as i stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, i won't destroy the future."
21486,Homer,"y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--"
36570,Homer,"oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. now go to bed."
33398,Homer,homer simpson. class president.
28570,Homer,"many childless advocates are like ben affleck -- famous, successful people from out of state!"
25075,Homer,"school, please."
21551,Homer,ow! stop pummeling me! it's really painful!
38401,Homer,but...
36153,Homer,how ya doin' there?
23998,Homer,"son, i learned everything i needed to know from ""the horse whisperer"". step one: seduce a lonely housewife."
19482,Homer,huh. what's that blinking light?
38755,Homer,"guys, i really need your honesty here. at the squidport senior jamboree... was i too in the pocket?"
15524,Homer,"marge, i want to be a monorail conductor."
32128,Homer,"i'm gettin' that job. bart, i'll need some clean urine. stat."
17030,Homer,take another bath in malt liquor?
25988,Homer,huh?
36142,Homer,"well, we do."
24072,Homer,"easy answer, eh?"
13451,Homer,"i can't believe you guys. there's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. and you don't wanna cash in? that's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
31665,Homer,it's dark in here!
27304,Homer,but i'm not drunk!
19982,Homer,yes. this is homer simpson from america. who may i say is speaking to me?
24472,Homer,i didn't hit your precious table.
16522,Homer,woo hoo! problem solved!
34215,Homer,"catch, boy!"
28290,Homer,there's bugs bunny... fat elvis... autumn in new england... bats of the southwest... all heroes. wanna see elvis kiss a bat? hey baby come here lemme kiss you...
34588,Homer,keep guessing...
19156,Homer,"well, my family wants to move back to springfield."
14310,Homer,"marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
17527,Homer,"marge, what's wrong? are you hungry? sleepy? gassy? gassy? is it gas? it's gas, isn't it?"
17917,Homer,"oh wow! i can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, mel brooks! i love that movie, ""young frankenstein"". ...scared the hell out of me."
17921,Homer,"stupid driving test at the stupid dmv where stupid patty and stupid selma work. sometimes i think god is teasing me, just like he teased moses in the desert."
37257,Homer,flanders?! how'd you get in here? this place is a highly-sensitive area.
33781,Homer,what do you mean? and who are you?
22365,Homer,"hey, it's the beer copter!"
34887,Homer,"come on out, birdie! follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
33702,Homer,"and now, you're gonna visit your grampa while i park around the corner and take a nap."
13686,Homer,lousy. he just sits there all day. he'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
19694,Homer,i prefer to listen to cheap trick.
25093,Homer,"uh yes, i see that it's in bill form. excellent."
15146,Homer,"hey you goats, get outta here!"
22151,Homer,"oh, fat tony."
39947,Homer,"krusty, i'm man enough to admit i was wrong, and i'm sorry i fingered you in court. i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated."
24410,Homer,there's no good place!
13614,Homer,"wow! ""win a trip to washington d.c.""! ""all expenses paid... vip tour""... oh. it's for kids."
16399,Homer,"observe, boy. the secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
15985,Homer,"well, you haven't heard the last of them."
41376,Homer,i wonder if there's birds on the moon. i miss marge.
31417,Homer,"why, doesn't he need it? oh, right."
26006,Homer,"ah, whatever. just give me a duff."
27561,Homer,why you little...!
24798,Homer,"well, why do i have to do the lindy hop?"
40558,Homer,"no, of course you're not going to die. everything's fine!"
24388,Homer,bawitdaba / banana fana / ooga chocka / etc.
19227,Homer,"yes, sir. i do."
15389,Homer,"eh, you don't want to hear that story. i know! i'll tell you about the time i got locked in the bank vault with mr. mooney. it was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
40612,Homer,"i'll try this little pink one, here. hmmm, very good. another one."
36522,Homer,"son, you can dial down the crazy. your mother and i talked about it and we found a way to get to new york. it's all set, boy. to save money, we're swapping houses."
19644,Homer,"you said it, ya weirdo."
24315,Homer,"stupid barney, thinks he's too good for me."
28621,Homer,i wish i had bullies like you growing up.
35761,Homer,this party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
39185,Homer,if anything happens to marge... we'll all be orphans!
17859,Homer,"hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
31625,Homer,oh. hold on.
31942,Homer,any moment...
20666,Homer,"well, the boy told us. but that was after we filed a phony police report."
15860,Homer,"it'll be great to see the old gang again... potsy, ralph malph, ""the fonz""..."
16610,Homer,nooooo!
19636,Homer,"stay back! i have powers! uh, political powers!"
32395,Homer,and what color would that be?
21042,Homer,nu-cue-lar. it's pronounced nu-cue-lar.
32225,Homer,"die, you stupid cobra, die!"
15228,Homer,"no! mr. burns, i'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
32788,Homer,"dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
33370,Homer,the ballot box?!
38324,Homer,somebody kill me.
41459,Homer,no fair!
19985,Homer,ow!
34613,Homer,moe's leaving town?!
25276,Homer,"do-i-have-cooties? no. oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
34275,Homer,she used to be my therapist.
21059,Homer,fire the torpedoes!
27143,Homer,"marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children."
25902,Homer,no!
16890,Homer,i know. he's grooming me. mmm... elephant fresh.
19590,Homer,how could i not? i saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. i saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into america's already bloated snack-hole. so i did what i could. i did what any loving husband would do: i reached out to some violent mobsters.
32693,Homer,now let's add the rear window defogger!
23077,Homer,"like we say in my country, ""hasta la vista, baby."""
34550,Homer,we'll have to eat thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
34960,Homer,can i be johnny undercover?
36784,Homer,how long have i been playing?
41565,Homer,"why aren't i happy? i'm the hottest grunge artist on mucous records, weird al is doing a parody of my song..."
36511,Homer,"aw boy, i feel for ya. nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
38364,Homer,why you little! i'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
36479,Homer,"i've always said ""hungry""!"
19690,Homer,"i'm sure we will, honey."
23242,Homer,after we trusted you...
22325,Homer,me? nah. unless there's a coupon for it. nah.
22389,Homer,"marge, that was debbie pinson. deb-bie pin-son."
22887,Homer,step two: snorkel the animals.
40028,Homer,"hey, dr. j."
37177,Homer,licking the wrapper.
29766,Homer,i seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
28568,Homer,you've probably heard a lot of bad things about families come first.
31602,Homer,"i shouldn't be here, i was framed!"
29724,Homer,"hm, where's the pain? there it is!"
20692,Homer,i wouldn't / i couldn't / i hate that stuff!
25776,Homer,why you little...
33203,Homer,what is it?
18439,Homer,stupid switch! i wish i had my reaching-broom!
26365,Homer,"oh my god, it's our high school prom! and once again i have no date!"
15740,Homer,i would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
14900,Homer,nothin' could be finah.
26297,Homer,everyone here has a six pack and i'm the only one with a keg.
28311,Homer,wow. i can't believe we met mr. bean.
39906,Homer,"oh, just some blueprints adil wanted. i'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. i bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to."
28869,Homer,"oh my god! if i get one more d.u.i., they'll take away my license. and what will i leave when i rent rollerblades?"
34002,Homer,to the panic room store!
41515,Homer,friends forever?
20423,Homer,"i'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. from now on, i'm gonna work you like a dog. now go fetch me twenty laps."
18870,Homer,i won't tell anybody.
15390,Homer,"wait a minute. that was a ""lucy"" show... okay, where were we?"
22381,Homer,"there's ""the laughter family."" that's animated. networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
24106,Homer,"it's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. if they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker."
23294,Homer,and the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
31585,Homer,oh my god! it's beautiful!
18175,Homer,"oh, i always wanted to be a teamster. so lazy and surly. mind if i relax next to you?"
38995,Homer,"marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. fighting him is like kicking george washington in his wooden nuts!"
27442,Homer,"oh, like i'm gonna kick chief wiggum in the groin."
40073,Homer,i de...
39748,Homer,fair enough.
29697,Homer,you guys are commies? then why am i seeing rudimentary free markets?
21295,Homer,stupid kids...
26184,Homer,"no, you are an angel like denzel washington in ""the preacher's wife,"" or will smith in ""bagger vance,"" or slimer in ""ghostbusters."""
14566,Homer,"these guys aren't so tough. i've got ""wonder bat."""
27741,Homer,why are you looking at me like that?
20730,Homer,do i like chicken?
29807,Homer,"well, if you really must know..."
17809,Homer,"you mean i get 5% off on everything in the store just because i look like... i mean, just because i am krusty the clown?"
25758,Homer,umm-hm.
18397,Homer,pro: uhh... uhh... i love you?
39859,Homer,"go get help, boy."
17735,Homer,thanks for giving me my old job back.
18886,Homer,"oh, why did i have to stop at the railroad tracks? better get some change."
34159,Homer,...and that lasted about five years. but then godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. all of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
22862,Homer,i don't get it. why don't people like my art anymore?
28001,Homer,"hey, take it easy. i went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family..."
28248,Homer,candlepin bowling? that's a great idea. we'll play right after i break your grandmother out of prison.
37222,Homer,i don't know. should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
29684,Homer,"but marge, i don't want her to be happy."
40830,Homer,gotta go.
19998,Homer,wow. you've got pencils with your name on 'em. just like a pencil company executive. i'd give anything for one of these.
31309,Homer,what's goin' on?
34382,Homer,"hey, my bathing suit came off!"
29018,Homer,huh?
24143,Homer,hmm... this doesn't look so bad.
29331,Homer,i've learned to walk naked on stilts!
41409,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
34308,Homer,about virgil.
33031,Homer,"i've got you, my friend."
33194,Homer,who are you?
31582,Homer,why you little...
15124,Homer,"please marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
31700,Homer,"you there, boy! buy me a christmas goose! the biggest one in the shop!"
23015,Homer,"yeah, so? come on! more kissing!"
40493,Homer,"boy, i've tried ordering you, i've tried punishing you, and god help me, i even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
36260,Homer,could you give my wife a few lessons?
17385,Homer,"see, she's having the time of her life."
21608,Homer,"ohhh, it's no use. i can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community."
26990,Homer,anybody else? come on...
19186,Homer,no problemo.
18509,Homer,we may be the best parents in the world.
17370,Homer,"ma-arge. they can't carry enough candy. they have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
19272,Homer,"now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. it's called responsibility."
18926,Homer,"you know what, apu... i am really, really gonna miss you."
26076,Homer,"ohh... geez, i just wanted to escape."
20836,Homer,woo hoo!
41136,Homer,the hell with this.
35113,Homer,"i can't talk now, i'm talking to myself! no, no, homer, go ahead. thanks, homer, it'll just be a minute. what's up?"
39531,Homer,"unfortunately, son, we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own."
14897,Homer,sounds interesting.
24710,Homer,can we make this hand high-low?
35373,Homer,"what do i do? patty's gonna kill me! unless... i kill her first! i put the body in the car, i dump the car in the lake, i put a james taylor cd in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
28714,Homer,"you know, marge and i have an anniversary coming up."
20347,Homer,i thought smithers did it.
32126,Homer,how many of those have private planes?
28863,Homer,"yes, and you've said that several times now."
20197,Homer,"when a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
41438,Homer,i'll kill you the way i killed intellectual homer!
38191,Homer,"sounds delicious. it's not. hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
30857,Homer,oh my god!
32904,Homer,i just wish she hadn't died thinking i hated her.
22732,Homer,"c'mon out, boy. it's windy."
35695,Homer,"so it's weird -- don't worry, i'll make it fun."
26338,Homer,quit banging my wife!
40008,Homer,the what?
20933,Homer,whoa! hang on a minute! the guard said i have visitors coming!
36312,Homer,but i can't afford this...
22165,Homer,senior citizen? flanders?
39703,Homer,"oh no, no. we stink, we stink!"
34449,Homer,"okay, left hand: rembrandt!"
24082,Homer,"single women of springfield, your prayers have been flanswered."
23540,Homer,"waldo, where are you?!"
32768,Homer,uh... are you sure you want lisa to keep dancing?
25338,Homer,"now lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. let's just say i'm replacing you."
13784,Homer,what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do?
24159,Homer,you don't have tv? but what will i watch while i'm sitting on the couch?
21844,Homer,see? it's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. the only one who understands me is that guy who married martha raye.
15230,Homer,"gotcha. marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice."
40530,Homer,"... oh, hey, thank you, maggie."
21316,Homer,i have been working out secretly at night. and look at me now!
20686,Homer,"wait, wait, wait. here comes lee marvin. thank god. he's always drunk and violent."
25658,Homer,"oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!"
32999,Homer,"yes, for now. i guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. maybe we could order one of your cakes for lisa's birthday."
27223,Homer,so how do you afford such a sweet pad?
13207,Homer,got it.
15440,Homer,"oh night, when christ was born..."
41281,Homer,bo-ring.
40386,Homer,"i'm game if you are, flanders."
22619,Homer,"ya gotta admit, marge, that's a lot more roaming."
34991,Homer,huh?
23459,Homer,go get lassie.
18311,Homer,that's weird. it's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
18737,Homer,okay.
23832,Homer,bart! leave some for rod and todd!
21013,Homer,nice fella. i wonder if he's gay?
24859,Homer,"no kiddin'. what do you think of my page, lisa? be honest. it's great, isn't it? go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
25712,Homer,did you say anterior?
38803,Homer,gimme another one.
15671,Homer,yes! you saved my life. how much?
38433,Homer,is that the boy you named me after?
26749,Homer,hi-yo!
40625,Homer,"no need, doc. i can read marge like a book."
26132,Homer,"well marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
17828,Homer,hey! i'm doing it! i'm doing it! i'm the greatest clown in the world!
39155,Homer,eight million?
37896,Homer,"bless you, boy. that was the greatest thing i've seen on a computer that i can talk about with you in the room. how did you know how to do that?"
23762,Homer,sorry.
20518,Homer,yeah!
30478,Homer,he looks tough.
37248,Homer,"here, i'll get you started. hail superman, wearing tights, clark kent be thy name... one nation, under zod..."
34844,Homer,that would be one weird-looking kid.
36402,Homer,"i get it. you need your marge time. well, i'm off to work."
23569,Homer,"thank you, bart's teacher. you know, kids, my teachers said i would never amount to anything. and until last week, they were dead right. but now i've achieved perfection."
38304,Homer,"uh, yeah, help me out here. what is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?"
32005,Homer,"say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? mine is. still, i wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. well, let's get some shut-eye."
26343,Homer,unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
20184,Homer,"now, son, on your first day of school, i'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
35051,Homer,wait a minute! your standard markup is four hundred percent?
39129,Homer,"well, that's the logic. where's the affection?"
14023,Homer,when did i ever teach you that?
22730,Homer,"the second i let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in."
13336,Homer,"oh, dr. hibbert. enjoying the party?"
33228,Homer,kitten calendar.
52759,Ned Flanders,"uh, be careful there, homer. that is sort of a new table."
52690,Ned Flanders,oh my stars!
54471,Ned Flanders,okay.
53798,Ned Flanders,"well, it might be fun to be a landlord. landfella -- there's only one lord!"
53429,Ned Flanders,"all right, i'll take the couch and you can have my room."
52812,Ned Flanders,"mommy had to go away. she's with god, now."
53566,Ned Flanders,"now rainier, i really don't think it's right to sell these playdude centerfolds."
54312,Ned Flanders,"sure is! that's why after homer accidentally killed edna, i married maude's ghost!"
52785,Ned Flanders,"oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! he's annoying. he's very, very annoying!"
54518,Ned Flanders,"say, that's right. this is your first visit to the flanders homestead."
53820,Ned Flanders,"boys, we're home!"
54454,Ned Flanders,"pray for a miracle, boy! god can hear you better from up there!"
53490,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, i need to ask ya a favor. my baby sitter canceled and i got tickets to a christian rock concert."
54570,Ned Flanders,"shhh. it's coming up, son, it's coming up."
54365,Ned Flanders,"lord, you're testin' me, aren't ya?"
54088,Ned Flanders,i'm afraid you can't live here.
54576,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'."
54491,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, our good lord, and my boys are all i've really got. all edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which i'm still working my way through."
53265,Ned Flanders,check it out! mad dog's on fire!
52575,Ned Flanders,"you know at times like these, i-i used to turn to the bible and find solace. but even the good book can't help me now."
53967,Ned Flanders,greed!
53998,Ned Flanders,what the?
54100,Ned Flanders,"reverend, care for some of my devils food cake?"
53328,Ned Flanders,"i just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. i can't believe my last words to maude were ""no foot-longs."""
54460,Ned Flanders,"i said a fit, not a fervor!"
53401,Ned Flanders,"we'll just see about that-- uh-oh. well, maybe he made a mistake-- nope. it's airtight."
53357,Ned Flanders,"i'll be right back, boys. i'm going to go help that lady."
52645,Ned Flanders,"why, sue dokes, you rascal! i thought you were dead and--"
54181,Ned Flanders,"isn't this great, marge? we're like jiminy cricket for the whole ding-dang town. a half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. um-hm."
53399,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. this one's fine and dandy, roddy. it's approved by a council of presbylutheran ministers."
53188,Ned Flanders,"god homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. rumba! yea, i was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
52696,Ned Flanders,isn't that nice?
53317,Ned Flanders,maude?
53847,Ned Flanders,really? do you mind if i bring my boys over so she can infect rod and todd? then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
54308,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the ""cross"" games, simpsons! a christian fellowship expo!"
53902,Ned Flanders,"you're leavin' already? we, we haven't even gotten in yet."
52630,Ned Flanders,let's not and say we did.
53299,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, i..."
54202,Ned Flanders,"i never wanted to turn into big brother. i just wanted to be little sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
54260,Ned Flanders,"yeah, let me guess. you're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' edna."
52558,Ned Flanders,"oh, right as rain. or, as we say around here, left as rain."
54117,Ned Flanders,and she's teleconferencing the devil using that computer from hell!
53692,Ned Flanders,"here you go, principal skinner, mrs. skinner."
54231,Ned Flanders,"you know, i don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. anyhoo, so i don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."
54209,Ned Flanders,"glad to hear it, thank the holy spirit!"
53244,Ned Flanders,homer!
53511,Ned Flanders,homer!
53586,Ned Flanders,speaking in tongues. what great kids.
54124,Ned Flanders,i play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
52662,Ned Flanders,"and since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my tv tr..."
54374,Ned Flanders,here it is. the holy ooze.
52780,Ned Flanders,"we did it, we got rid of..."
53910,Ned Flanders,we want you to teach alternative theories to darwinian evolution.
52665,Ned Flanders,"first come, first served! what are you in for?"
53727,Ned Flanders,"don't worry, sweetie. i am not going to kill your father."
54499,Ned Flanders,"why, i bet the lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. our mission is one hundred percent pure."
54525,Ned Flanders,"ah, kids can be a trial sometimes."
53025,Ned Flanders,"thanks, everyone. i'm all better now. no more storing up the anger 'til i explode. if any of you does something i don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"

53932,Ned Flanders,"only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
53790,Ned Flanders,"all right, neighbor, i'll baby-sit."
53537,Ned Flanders,"doo-da, doo-da..."
53515,Ned Flanders,me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. it's the best darn diddly way to start your first flanders day!
52711,Ned Flanders,"okay, now, everybody take out your junior campers pocketknives..."
53830,Ned Flanders,"that tears it! boys, put on your goody two-shoes. we're moving back to springfield!"
53288,Ned Flanders,my rumpus room with the new bumper pool table.
53639,Ned Flanders,"se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly..."
52795,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you."
54531,Ned Flanders,"hello, reverend lovejoy."
54426,Ned Flanders,never get into heaven... took harp lessons for nothing...
53662,Ned Flanders,"oh, i got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
53926,Ned Flanders,"oh i don't mean to cause gil ill will, but still..."
54524,Ned Flanders,"oh, you know how that embarrasses me."
52735,Ned Flanders,"godspeed, li'l doodle."
53273,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that looks scrum-diddly-doodly-duddly --"
52913,Ned Flanders,you know...
53034,Ned Flanders,"they're not perfect, but the lord says love thy neighbor --"
52773,Ned Flanders,there's homer. there's homer too. that's also homer. that's homer.
54206,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
54140,Ned Flanders,"yep. i also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
53995,Ned Flanders,"well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
54385,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, the lord wouldn't have placed his meter there if he didn't want me to park."
52912,Ned Flanders,"you have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. i'm sorry. i'm just nervous, i didn't mean any disrespect."
53703,Ned Flanders,"well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. if so, then i guess i'm just a cave man. if they existed, which they didn't!"
52703,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, bart!"
54584,Ned Flanders,"mr. universe, i wish!"
52717,Ned Flanders,"oh warren, i know your dad is in prison, but don't you fret. a special celebrity dad has been arranged for ya."
54292,Ned Flanders,because of you i'm going to hell!
52676,Ned Flanders,april fool's!
53210,Ned Flanders,"ooh, nuts."
53741,Ned Flanders,must... kill... best friend.
54082,Ned Flanders,because your father lives with me now.
53979,Ned Flanders,"listen sheriff, i can help you take down bonnie and clyde."
53610,Ned Flanders,heaven's gate! i'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week.
53649,Ned Flanders,"i love you, too. and i always will. but unlike the bible, i guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
53700,Ned Flanders,"lighten up, roddy."
53862,Ned Flanders,and purple and white and pink and orange / and red and yellow and green and brown / scarlet and black and ochre and peach...
52968,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o! it's good for keeping down the urges."
53889,Ned Flanders,the 'n' word!
53606,Ned Flanders,yep. why would that twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
53520,Ned Flanders,"come on, boys."
53850,Ned Flanders,"well, they might. but you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
54214,Ned Flanders,"indeedily-doodily i do, and i love him just as much as you! it's a flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
54398,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! this is a clip-on!"
53604,Ned Flanders,i need your advice. it's about a lady.
53223,Ned Flanders,"aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. how can we sabotage his labor of love?"
53934,Ned Flanders,"homer, you've met my parents."
52691,Ned Flanders,"say your prayers, simpson..."
52755,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, stanster."
53621,Ned Flanders,no way! i won't even eat vegetables over two inches long.
53564,Ned Flanders,"shop o' the mornin', homer! just call me ""mall"" flanders."
53010,Ned Flanders,thank you. doctor foster?
52944,Ned Flanders,"open the door, maude! i don't have time for the secret knock!"
53956,Ned Flanders,just get in there!
53076,Ned Flanders,"all right, wildcats! are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
53989,Ned Flanders,oh for crying out loud -- people aren't mice!
53226,Ned Flanders,"leapin' lazarus! is this what passes for eternal rest these days? rod, go get daddy his buryin' shovel."
52965,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
54345,Ned Flanders,you pulled the boys out of school?!
53656,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. but it looks like you're missin' a piece."
54188,Ned Flanders,stop gleaming that cube!
54318,Ned Flanders,make way for captain coolerhead!
53472,Ned Flanders,whoa! where's everyone going? what's wrong?
53159,Ned Flanders,"l-listen, folks, there's no magic formula. i just follow the three c's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church."
54349,Ned Flanders,"chillax?! young man, in the flanders house, we speak the king's diddily."
53645,Ned Flanders,it says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. and that's good enough for me.
53547,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure didn't."
53319,Ned Flanders,"oh, wasn't she? thank you, moe. i appreciate that."
54489,Ned Flanders,never claimed to be.
54220,Ned Flanders,homer! gimme back my tree!
54139,Ned Flanders,"y'know, our bible study group is going to the holy land next month. i'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
54111,Ned Flanders,"marge, that dinner was a winner! what's for dessert?"
52661,Ned Flanders,"heidy-ho, simpson. your son shoved this through our doggie door."
52593,Ned Flanders,"fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. well sir, i gave him three quarters by mistake. took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
53377,Ned Flanders,"""they're controlling our minds with flu shots?!"" i knew it. well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
53545,Ned Flanders,"here's a preview. god said to noah / build yourself an ark-y ark-y / animals came on by ones and twosies, twosies / elephants and kangaroosies - roosies..."
53602,Ned Flanders,i've got a date with a movie star?!
52801,Ned Flanders,woopsy-doodle.
53013,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll be darn-diddly-arned."
54023,Ned Flanders,"forget it! i am turning in my... well, i don't really have anything to turn in. so that's that! i suggest you call homer simpson."
53517,Ned Flanders,ooh. who wants to hold mommy's hair?
53242,Ned Flanders,"and after i created my fingers to the bone for you i... my unicorn! oh, what have they done to you, gary?"
53459,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
53880,Ned Flanders,"and so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
54360,Ned Flanders,"well, hello! it's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
54225,Ned Flanders,"i didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat!"
52747,Ned Flanders,ned flanders...
52821,Ned Flanders,"hey, why that sounds like gabriel's trumpet. you know what that means, kids?"
53093,Ned Flanders,"we've come for the angel, homer. it's not safe with the unbeliever."
54547,Ned Flanders,"now, just a minute, simpson. i think my son has a very good chance."
53146,Ned Flanders,"oh, now roddy, it's just a stuck ball. i'll get it."
52547,Ned Flanders,"so homer, i'm dyin' to know. what do you think of the leftorium?"
53059,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, thank the lord! he's truly watching over--"
52729,Ned Flanders,"wrong, we're saved! sea gulls always stay near land. they only go out to sea to die."
52973,Ned Flanders,but it could be my mother! howdi...
54185,Ned Flanders,"mm-hmm! now i'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. tsk, tsk, tsk."
53352,Ned Flanders,that's right. and i may not go to church tomorrow.
54478,Ned Flanders,"i learned that left is called ""port""!"
54274,Ned Flanders,i guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
54156,Ned Flanders,"homer, this is the most sacred spot in christendom, not your backyard hammock."
53205,Ned Flanders,ginger's my wife.
52637,Ned Flanders,nooo!
52820,Ned Flanders,"huh? well, now that i can't explain."
53080,Ned Flanders,what?! what is it?!
52743,Ned Flanders,"welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, i think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
53726,Ned Flanders,'cause i had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
53807,Ned Flanders,i coulda sworn i just heard someone shriek my name.
54336,Ned Flanders,"no, but i'm sure newt gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong."
53014,Ned Flanders,it sure did-diddly-id.
53660,Ned Flanders,"well, the bible says it's fun to do stuff together."
54555,Ned Flanders,"eh, eh, just a minute. ""loser"" is such a harsh word. couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
53336,Ned Flanders,homer!
53803,Ned Flanders,"here's your room, ladies. you can catch some z's while you earn those degrees."
54477,Ned Flanders,should we do something?
53057,Ned Flanders,help! what do i do?!
53735,Ned Flanders,i gotta find homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
54391,Ned Flanders,"dad, don't encourage him."
53453,Ned Flanders,but i...
52574,Ned Flanders,"listen to that singing... those poor fools. homer, i'm ruined."
54219,Ned Flanders,"oh, don't be scared, boys. that's just the angels bowling."
54147,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
54047,Ned Flanders,that's just your trouser devil talking!
53985,Ned Flanders,"ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- i don't think so."
53099,Ned Flanders,"oooo, that's a dilly. how 'bout it, marge?"
54265,Ned Flanders,joey kramer? the drummer from aerosmith?
53751,Ned Flanders,i don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...
52958,Ned Flanders,"...adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. and, of course, in canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
54435,Ned Flanders,noooo!
52667,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""sweatin' to the oldies,"" volumes one, two and four."
53263,Ned Flanders,"now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. oh! man, that's good."
54282,Ned Flanders,"are you sure, lord?"
53808,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's better."
52650,Ned Flanders,you'll be hist...
53778,Ned Flanders,"""so god blessed noah and his sons, and said to them... never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth. i set my rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between god and man."" thank you."
54544,Ned Flanders,"hey, i like that confidence!... but i hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. my todd's awfully good."
53779,Ned Flanders,"well now roddy, the lord wouldn't let us die this way."
52792,Ned Flanders,"well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! as chairman of the pta, i am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and i think i can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
53747,Ned Flanders,"well, my roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
52959,Ned Flanders,"oh, my. i better get you some cider."
54569,Ned Flanders,"oh my, lisa was wonderful. she certainly's come a long way with her fingering."
54421,Ned Flanders,no! you can't! if i'm not as good as you... then i'm horrible!
52954,Ned Flanders,"well, if god didn't make little green apples -- it's homer simpson! how long have you been here?"
53280,Ned Flanders,i resisted these for thirty-five years! why did i wear them today?
52879,Ned Flanders,"nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
54291,Ned Flanders,i'm gonna kill you!
53260,Ned Flanders,i think i'm gonna be sick.
53208,Ned Flanders,"well, do something! this is all your fault. you and your stupid program."
53461,Ned Flanders,"well thanks, homer."
53249,Ned Flanders,looks like heaven's easier to get into than arizona state.
53201,Ned Flanders,here comes that vomit again.
52876,Ned Flanders,peek-a-boo! i see you!
52632,Ned Flanders,the door's frozen shut... and it's the only way out!

52997,Ned Flanders,"well, i've seen about enough."
52537,Ned Flanders,"why homer, you silly goose! the weed whacker's just for the edges! you're gonna be out here all day!"
53382,Ned Flanders,what?
52881,Ned Flanders,"babe. we got you, babe."
54340,Ned Flanders,"homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?"
53245,Ned Flanders,i said homer!
53693,Ned Flanders,"my angle is givin' in this world, livin' in the next."
54090,Ned Flanders,i think you should. the court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
53246,Ned Flanders,god... bless him!
52534,Ned Flanders,"why, homer simpson! here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
52896,Ned Flanders,"until this, i never thought homer and marge were bad parents. but now i know you kids need a less hellbound family."
53482,Ned Flanders,"hello, gas company? how poisonous is your gas?... wow. but-- eh, but i'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... how could that be worse?... okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... i see."
53100,Ned Flanders,"oh, my-diddily-i. will you look at this place! and the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
54334,Ned Flanders,s'okay... she's my wife.
53166,Ned Flanders,in the bathroom. not trimmin' my mustache. whaddaya think? do i remind you of troubled troubadour david crosby?
54165,Ned Flanders,"it's because i believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. at least i thought so till now. homer simpson, you are not worth saving."
53474,Ned Flanders,it is! it's a bemusement park!
53115,Ned Flanders,"hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
52798,Ned Flanders,"anyhoo, bart, you're gonna have to be punished. this isn't just some sort of club house."
54132,Ned Flanders,i'll handle this.
52707,Ned Flanders,"hey now, marge. let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
53323,Ned Flanders,"homer, this really isn't necessary..."
53906,Ned Flanders,"um, that was god disguised as a stork."
52927,Ned Flanders,thankily-dankily! greatalicious!
53108,Ned Flanders,"oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
53404,Ned Flanders,i really hate to be a snitch.
54352,Ned Flanders,"i just felt so ashamed i just couldn't go home. today, i gave in to the one thing i vowed i would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
54127,Ned Flanders,"now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""welcome to bible study!"""
53110,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi, marge. heh-heh. guess we gave you quite a start. we were painting todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. must've dozed off."
54093,Ned Flanders,"hey, cool your jets! we're trying to get to sleep!"
54042,Ned Flanders,"wordplay: never cared for it. but it's never too soon for you two to join the ""i do"" crew. now i'm not sayin' it's all jell-o with cool whip. she'll nag ya. she'll try to change ya. you'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
53295,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, schuss in boots."
54066,Ned Flanders,"well, actually... as your landlord, repairs are my responsibility. i'll just get my tools..."
53237,Ned Flanders,"eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit?"
52644,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy strangers! what can i do ya for?"
53027,Ned Flanders,um-hm.
53625,Ned Flanders,"well, i can't see the harm."
53739,Ned Flanders,don't do it! don't do it! you'll kill everyone!
54259,Ned Flanders,oh my.
53789,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, but i promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
52754,Ned Flanders,"heh-heh, yeah."
53264,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho! why bother, baby? one smoke detector's enough for mad dog. now let's hit the sack."
54016,Ned Flanders,"oh, kitten whiskers!"
52577,Ned Flanders,"you know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. it's like there's been a-a curse on me."
53379,Ned Flanders,"oh, no! i could never support the black arts."
52995,Ned Flanders,"was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
52601,Ned Flanders,"he's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
54354,Ned Flanders,pause the assembly! i have to talk to my wife!
53020,Ned Flanders,"oh, now, why would i be afraid of that?"
52771,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't know..."
54417,Ned Flanders,"jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!"
54171,Ned Flanders,i'd like that.
52850,Ned Flanders,"oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the flanderosa."
53134,Ned Flanders,8:45?! here i am yappin' away like it's 8:35. don't forget the mints.
53650,Ned Flanders,i'm sorry.
54097,Ned Flanders,parson! parson! give us a quick official church position on family.
53042,Ned Flanders,"lisa, ned flanders. you available tonight?"
54453,Ned Flanders,tithe denied! tithe denied!
54153,Ned Flanders,bleh! bleh! bleh!
54310,Ned Flanders,sports stands for strict parental oversight rather than sports!
53855,Ned Flanders,"christ is born, who's on my horn?"
54568,Ned Flanders,"y'know, simpson, i feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
53581,Ned Flanders,"where you going, reverend? the town's that way. reverend? you're goin' the wrong way!"
53837,Ned Flanders,it sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. mind if i waggle my finger a little bit?
53126,Ned Flanders,oops! that's for me. flancrest enterprises is my home business.
52806,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, what a pleasant..."
53462,Ned Flanders,"morning, kent. our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. we're gonna show springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
52563,Ned Flanders,"oh, yeah. sure. thought i'd just get rid of some of the clutter. see anything you like?"
53168,Ned Flanders,"never a dull moment, huh, homer?"
54498,Ned Flanders,am i hearing this right? is the church council truly considering... gambling?
54003,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. and also, thank you for my partner homer, who..."
53395,Ned Flanders,now let's go save those kids.
54189,Ned Flanders,buttocks!
54002,Ned Flanders,"my friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
54474,Ned Flanders,that was my spatula!
53950,Ned Flanders,"top of the mornin', tow-mer!"
52977,Ned Flanders,"oh, it'll be fun. we're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. make sure we don't owe anything extra."
53553,Ned Flanders,maude! you still look as pretty as the day i buried you.
54502,Ned Flanders,"just hold your horses, son. hey, hey, simpson."
53497,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure would. it would give the boys a place to go after school."
52949,Ned Flanders,"hello, ""mr. brown ground"", whatcha got for me?"
54483,Ned Flanders,why that's a higher power than even i believe in. what is going on?

53526,Ned Flanders,"heaven and earth... where were we? oh, now i'm lost."
52903,Ned Flanders,"well, i expect that type of language at denny's, but not here."
52770,Ned Flanders,we're headin' back. todd's got zesty italian in his eye.
53350,Ned Flanders,"lord, i never question you... but i've been wondering if your decision to take maude was, well, wrong... unless this is part of your divine plan... could you just give me some kinda sign? anything? and after all that church chocolate i bought. which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. well, i've had it."
53305,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
54049,Ned Flanders,"sweet dreams, my new best friend."
54254,Ned Flanders,"pretty funny, homer."
54369,Ned Flanders,asterisk-pound sign-at sign-exclamation point!
54514,Ned Flanders,"say simpson, i-i've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
53491,Ned Flanders,"it's gonna be one wholesome evening. so, do you think marge could take care of rowdy roddy and typhoon todd?"
53702,Ned Flanders,"they were two for one at krusty home depot, so i got an extra one for you guys!"
53079,Ned Flanders,what?
54295,Ned Flanders,"but, but..."
54218,Ned Flanders,"hey there, mr. burns! for our half hour i thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
52741,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighboreenos."
52772,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please give me the strength to endure homer simpson's friendship."
54379,Ned Flanders,"i just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""the feud network"" to ""comity central."""
53619,Ned Flanders,i'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!
52660,Ned Flanders,"oh bart, you met grandma flanders. hope she didn't scare ya."
53202,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm, i'm workin' on that."

52926,Ned Flanders,tip-top-notch!
53296,Ned Flanders,"well, it allows for maximum mobility."
53771,Ned Flanders,"now i must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
54250,Ned Flanders,you have the energy for one more?
54072,Ned Flanders,hello?
53829,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's really touching. but my boys and i are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
54348,Ned Flanders,what if we were raptured right now?
54221,Ned Flanders,"hey-diddily-hi, homer."

52797,Ned Flanders,"bart, i've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. and now that i have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
53423,Ned Flanders,"oh, how horrible!"
53003,Ned Flanders,"oh yeah, the clown. the only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. and as for you -- i don't know you, but i'm sure you're a jerk."
54565,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? by working together, we can both be winners. thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. put 'er there, pal."

53593,Ned Flanders,"oh, i should say not. i gave up on l.a. when those tv people made that poor nun fly. all those puerto ricans lookin' up her dress. that's not right."
54441,Ned Flanders,he's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.
53196,Ned Flanders,"i'll have a shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... oh, what the heck, you only live once. give me a..."
52832,Ned Flanders,wait!
53653,Ned Flanders,you know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
53165,Ned Flanders,look at that! everyone's living it up except ned.

53923,Ned Flanders,"hiddily-ho, blobareeno."
54246,Ned Flanders,"edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but i'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
53454,Ned Flanders,"if you could do that, i'd make this place a shining beacon for the lord."
54192,Ned Flanders,"inspiration point looks pretty uninspired... all's quiet in murder town... yep, springfield is cleaner than the lord's hand towels."
52596,Ned Flanders,"sorry to bother you, reverend lovejoy, but i'm kind of in a tizzy. our son todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""

53392,Ned Flanders,"hm, sounds like a plan."

53655,Ned Flanders,and it wouldn't hurt you to put up some curtains.
53439,Ned Flanders,yea-- what?
53303,Ned Flanders,"oh, those poor souls. what's the christian thing to do?"
54330,Ned Flanders,never again will i question...
53997,Ned Flanders,now i can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
53813,Ned Flanders,"homer, is this true?"

52981,Ned Flanders,maude? rod? todd?
52533,Ned Flanders,"au contraire, simpson! it has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
53892,Ned Flanders,"rod... you can do it, boy! with god on your side, you can't fail!"
52710,Ned Flanders,"well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
52587,Ned Flanders,"ohh, would ya look at that?"
52551,Ned Flanders,"come on, homer! i got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
54314,Ned Flanders,"i thought i smelled death-a-diddly. what is that, an eight-pointer?"
53111,Ned Flanders,this is the murder house?!
52614,Ned Flanders,aren't we in luck? today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. come in my friend. let us feed and bathe you.
54458,Ned Flanders,i haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!
53827,Ned Flanders,why? so you can make me a laughingstock again?
54033,Ned Flanders,"thanks, but... what are you holding on to?"
52963,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm convinced. the house stays!"

52750,Ned Flanders,"well, get out the crayolas and color me tickled pink! oh, what's with the lead pipe? were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
52767,Ned Flanders,"sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
54137,Ned Flanders,"oh reverend, i've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
53427,Ned Flanders,my place? what would the neighbors think?
54237,Ned Flanders,"...y'know, i wouldn't mind homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
54520,Ned Flanders,"ain't she wonderful, simpson?"
53986,Ned Flanders,ow! what was that for?
53614,Ned Flanders,"sir, there's no reason sara needs to do this scene in the altogether."
53577,Ned Flanders,okely dokely.
54315,Ned Flanders,"hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way i write."
53596,Ned Flanders,"i sure do. you're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
54344,Ned Flanders,this could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. can you handle rod and todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
54277,Ned Flanders,we just wanted to give you all a big thank you from team nedna.

54326,Ned Flanders,"well, congratulations, homer. guess this is just my cross to bear."
54485,Ned Flanders,homer! this is my freezerino.
54150,Ned Flanders,"y'know, homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. please, neighbor?"
53495,Ned Flanders,"oh, roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center."
53422,Ned Flanders,"so, uh, uh, where's your band?"
54074,Ned Flanders,the rent check is late.
54108,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. i found out rod watched a commercial for ""grey's anatomy,"" and todd took a full day to tell me."
53559,Ned Flanders,"boy, that's jim dandy roof candy! i'd love to come over some time and watch that church channel."
54195,Ned Flanders,blind spot?! mecca?!
54581,Ned Flanders,"ohhh. i wanted to subscribe to that new arts and crafts channel. well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? he offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
52815,Ned Flanders,it's time to put you away.
53587,Ned Flanders,"okay boys, this is it. the end of this sinful little suburb."
53306,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that smarts. boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol."
52862,Ned Flanders,"okay, okay folks, look. i called the police captain in shelbyville. he says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
54014,Ned Flanders,"man, that's harder to swallow than evolution."
54287,Ned Flanders,"yes, lord."
54392,Ned Flanders,"now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!"
53498,Ned Flanders,me? okay.
52807,Ned Flanders,but you rang my...
53254,Ned Flanders,"now, homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."

54527,Ned Flanders,"simpson, i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to leave. i hope you understand."
53842,Ned Flanders,he's right. can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
53163,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. and some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. i'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. maybe with a--"

54043,Ned Flanders,i think i'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
52861,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i am putting up the halloweenie decorations a little early. criticism accepted."
54351,Ned Flanders,"fine, i guess. thanks for loaning me your pajamas, homer. and marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
54032,Ned Flanders,"i like you too, but you broke the law. so i've got to bring you in."
54492,Ned Flanders,"ah, just snowflakes on my mustache."
53572,Ned Flanders,"well, hot dog!"
53376,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're busy. catch you later, compu-tater."
53666,Ned Flanders,"well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
53419,Ned Flanders,"thank you, homer."
54229,Ned Flanders,it was right there... with the ... and the...
52942,Ned Flanders,"ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. just promise you'll have a good time."
53293,Ned Flanders,well i... okay.
54085,Ned Flanders,"lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
53026,Ned Flanders,"and if you really tick me off, i'm gonna run you down with my car!"
52852,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
53471,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
54389,Ned Flanders,"eh, for a little bit."
54380,Ned Flanders,"yes, but there's two sides to every--"
52849,Ned Flanders,"""'zounds"" is a renaissance english word, short for ""god's wounds."" but uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure flanders!"
53730,Ned Flanders,you leave me no choice!
54297,Ned Flanders,"oh, for cryin' out loud!"
54386,Ned Flanders,sure!
53777,Ned Flanders,wait a minute -- you've got a medium and i've got a message. maybe god brought us together for a reason.
52791,Ned Flanders,"well, gettin' closer."
52545,Ned Flanders,"well sir, like one out of every nine americans, i'm left-handed. and let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. your writing gets smeared. lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
53999,Ned Flanders,"us... a team? as the salad said to the soup, ""i'm all mixed up."""
53347,Ned Flanders,"well, diane, i've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
52659,Ned Flanders,"suppertime, boys."
53851,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho! there's ""no bot"" like a robot!"
52701,Ned Flanders,it's some sort of hideous monster.
53129,Ned Flanders,yep.
54413,Ned Flanders,homer. homer! i found the answer!
54079,Ned Flanders,"when the month is up, i want you out!"
53053,Ned Flanders,boys... there's a call here for you...
53712,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank god. you're finally fighting your demons."
53556,Ned Flanders,"okay, here's my amex."
52763,Ned Flanders,"...bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
53945,Ned Flanders,imploring people i never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. that's what i'm doing!
53823,Ned Flanders,"get rid of dr. fuzzenstein? why, i couldn't dream of thinking about considering..."
53883,Ned Flanders,"i'm not ned, i'm a friendly dog. oh, i'm not a good liar. i did come here to check on the... where's rod?"
54170,Ned Flanders,"homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, i think you came closest to the truth."
54077,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson, i took pity on you, and what do i get in return? a kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
54556,Ned Flanders,there you go.
52947,Ned Flanders,"now they're trying it as a maritime offense. so anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? free of charge."
53930,Ned Flanders,"he's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
54293,Ned Flanders,hell! damn! backside! nothing matters anymore! i'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
52948,Ned Flanders,"well, if it'll seal the deal, i'll take a look at your septic tank. see if i can get her hummin' again."
52757,Ned Flanders,"ooo, i guess it's time for me to duck again."
53156,Ned Flanders,"well, i did, but--"
53946,Ned Flanders,first things first!
53286,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! can i join?"
53707,Ned Flanders,huh?
52542,Ned Flanders,"friends, we love you all, but i also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being latin for ""left-handed."" but enough joking."
53432,Ned Flanders,"cold, huh?"
54488,Ned Flanders,"well, i felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
53430,Ned Flanders,"oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? i-i'm trying to preserve maude's indentation."
54203,Ned Flanders,that's the worst sin of all for some reason! what can i do to make things right?
52786,Ned Flanders,"thank you. thank you so much, homer. you really are a you're a true friend."
53963,Ned Flanders,pride!
54429,Ned Flanders,now you can shatter my orbital bone! that'll knock the wax off my candle!
53802,Ned Flanders,"you poor thing! i've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. girls, welcome to your very own ned and breakfast."
53921,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!"
52964,Ned Flanders,"well, we all changed our minds."
53125,Ned Flanders,"uh, is that your collar, reverend?"
52868,Ned Flanders,"uh, i'd like to hear from sideshow mel."
54164,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you know why i'm a christian?"
53436,Ned Flanders,"no, n-n-no i know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
52634,Ned Flanders,"homer, christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. hey, dig this."
53890,Ned Flanders,"uno?! that's a gateway game to pinochle. all diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
53424,Ned Flanders,"well, my wife's passing was rough, but i think i'm finally ready to move on."
52713,Ned Flanders,"here you go, your rubber training knife. you've attained the rank of pussy willow."
53046,Ned Flanders,"...well, i... i think i may be coveting my own wife..."
54506,Ned Flanders,this one's mine. and this one's mine. this one's mine... and this--
54585,Ned Flanders,"oh, you betcha! you know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
53322,Ned Flanders,"that's nice of you homer, but i think i'll just go to bed."
53389,Ned Flanders,"sure you did -- ""mr. plow."" you're wearin' the jacket right now!"
54393,Ned Flanders,there's no emergency here! and please charge us for the false report! i'm going out for a power walk.
53412,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
53176,Ned Flanders,all right.
53492,Ned Flanders,would you mind watching the kids? i'm kinda in a pickle here.
52599,Ned Flanders,but reverend...
52943,Ned Flanders,maude? boys? come on up! we're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
54275,Ned Flanders,"hey simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
53994,Ned Flanders,"young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
53857,Ned Flanders,"don't be nervous, ned. you've practiced this so many times in the shower."
53589,Ned Flanders,"well, sea captain, looks like you and i are sailin' solo tonight."
53550,Ned Flanders,"i'm with you, homer."
53836,Ned Flanders,"well, you've gotta take it back!"
52658,Ned Flanders,"so, kids, what do you want to play?"
53085,Ned Flanders,"good luck, homer. no hard feelin's."
54335,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, now we'll have an open marriage!"
54563,Ned Flanders,"mercy is for the weak, todd."
52976,Ned Flanders,"well, need some help there? you know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
53710,Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. it doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
54099,Ned Flanders,settle. settle down.
52635,Ned Flanders,"i see him, son."
53124,Ned Flanders,"you know, i pride myself on being a good host, so i'm obliged to offer you a beer. but i'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
53009,Ned Flanders,"uh, actually, i'm a little chilly. could i have another straitjacket?"
52555,Ned Flanders,absotively posilutely.
53064,Ned Flanders,"now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone."
53102,Ned Flanders,unless you can give me a reason not to?
53597,Ned Flanders,i'm as real as the nose on your face.
54086,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... interesting."
52595,Ned Flanders,"well, you knew i had a temper when you married me."
54025,Ned Flanders,not interested.
53917,Ned Flanders,"let's go, boys. your poor old popsicle's been licked."
54018,Ned Flanders,"homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! you need a special sticker just to bring a bike! have you no respect for the law?"
53193,Ned Flanders,"how do you do it, homer? how do you silence that little voice that says, ""think""?"
53661,Ned Flanders,"there's a stranger in the manger and his name is love take it, homer!"
53943,Ned Flanders,"god's least favorite word, uttered on the public airwaves!"
52718,Ned Flanders,"sorry, but i'm afraid ernest borgnine has already been confirmed."
53686,Ned Flanders,"oh, for the love of puppies."
53948,Ned Flanders,"why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?"
54062,Ned Flanders,one hundred and one thousand!
53334,Ned Flanders,is this a dating video?
53394,Ned Flanders,just like the one that saved ezekiel!
54376,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, god's there, with his little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
52940,Ned Flanders,know anything about water safety?
52983,Ned Flanders,"y'know, it's kinda funny. the only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. they're all we have left."
53854,Ned Flanders,i don't want flowers. i am a flower!
53426,Ned Flanders,"i'd love to get together, but tomorrow i've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
53878,Ned Flanders,"it's the ripcord from a band-aid wrapper! call me ned zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
54232,Ned Flanders,"okay, ms. krabappel, what made you topple?"
54539,Ned Flanders,"ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the todd-meister."
53373,Ned Flanders,"hey, uh, careful, boys. that arch is lookin' a little romanesque."
53063,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i hate to be a suspicious aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
53285,Ned Flanders,... can't put a price on a miracle...
53708,Ned Flanders,advice? just call me ann flanders!
53122,Ned Flanders,"oh ho, i'm afraid i played a dirty part in this little charade."
54319,Ned Flanders,"now, i like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but i do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
52760,Ned Flanders,"now, boys, mr. simpson is the guest. he gets to decide what to watch."
53442,Ned Flanders,"yeah, just a little shocked. what's that? some kinda sorting machine?"
53107,Ned Flanders,"uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
53447,Ned Flanders,"maude designed a christian amusement park. oh, it must have been her final dream."
54550,Ned Flanders,"all right, how's this for a wager? a batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
53568,Ned Flanders,"praise the lord, my seat has scored!"
52605,Ned Flanders,"look homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. so, i don't want to be hard on you... but i just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
53882,Ned Flanders,"well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet... why not?"
54280,Ned Flanders,no more distractions. i have work to do.
52970,Ned Flanders,ach! it was that darn recording again!
53420,Ned Flanders,it says i have cooties.
54059,Ned Flanders,i noticed.
54436,Ned Flanders,"well, the good news is it forced us all to church."
53651,Ned Flanders,"oh, darn the luck. that sounds like the lupus fun run."
53465,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, i think you're beautiful."
53835,Ned Flanders,did you steal the organ from the church?!
53218,Ned Flanders,what did the aliens look like?
53479,Ned Flanders,leak in the line?
53617,Ned Flanders,mm-hmm. i haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
53127,Ned Flanders,"no-ho-ho, it's true! maude and i sell religious hook rugs over the internet."
52572,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in capital city. hey what do think, kids? the big city!"
53078,Ned Flanders,"yeah. thanks for the tip, homer..."
53355,Ned Flanders,"electric guitars in church? oh, my gosh. some dropouts must have overpowered the reverend!"
52951,Ned Flanders,oh... uh...
52570,Ned Flanders,homer! over here!
54493,Ned Flanders,sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. are you just buying this to be nice?
53647,Ned Flanders,"well, and you will. right after the wedding."
53815,Ned Flanders,"don't say it, homer. this is not the time."
53339,Ned Flanders,"well, with triple word score, that's ninety! ha-ha, i guess my luck is starting to even out."
52571,Ned Flanders,"well, there's no house to put it in, homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
53214,Ned Flanders,will you shut up?
52924,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i'm welcoming the bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association."
54162,Ned Flanders,"please, you've gotta let me back in. i sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
52931,Ned Flanders,"aw, they're just family heirlooms. that shouldn't stand in the way of homer takin' my job and--"
53652,Ned Flanders,i bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
54338,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please bless our blended family..."
53033,Ned Flanders,hi-dilly-ho shary bobbins!
53458,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been a tad harder than i thought, but i'm not complaining 'cause i work for a sweet, sweet, boss. you're our foreman, maude."
52768,Ned Flanders,"how are my boys doin', homer?"
53952,Ned Flanders,"you know what they say: ""with great power comes great responsibility."""
52752,Ned Flanders,"wow, these are amazing seats, huh homer?"
52863,Ned Flanders,"well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the..."
54480,Ned Flanders,you're never bored paintin' the lord.
54548,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, i'm not a betting man."
52989,Ned Flanders,uh-huh. floor feels a little gritty here.
53533,Ned Flanders,"well, i know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
53160,Ned Flanders,"and, of course, i resist all the major urges."
53075,Ned Flanders,who are we going to beat?
52920,Ned Flanders,"what the heckaroonie is this, mrs. glick?"
52552,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, don't say. otherwise it won't come true."
53235,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a bossy betty, but i have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
52846,Ned Flanders,"flanders to god, flanders to god! get off your cloud and save my todd."
53957,Ned Flanders,welcome to eternal darnation!
52590,Ned Flanders,three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents.
53764,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i don't believe we've ever met."
53466,Ned Flanders,"ohh, what can i get you, little christian? how 'bout a noah's ark of jellies?"
53937,Ned Flanders,"a damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! oil-based!"
52739,Ned Flanders,okilly dokilly.
54420,Ned Flanders,what? why?!
54516,Ned Flanders,"well, you may be right!"
52738,Ned Flanders,"kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes?"
54136,Ned Flanders,"i sense a ""but"" coming, reverend..."
54217,Ned Flanders,"excuse me! with all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
53583,Ned Flanders,they've broken every commandment except one!
54268,Ned Flanders,no. just plain neighbor.
54350,Ned Flanders,"you get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy rod sneakers that light up like times square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! now, just when do i get a say in how my boys are raised?! this marriage isn't perfect!"
53045,Ned Flanders,i'm meek... but i could probably stand to be meeker.
52898,Ned Flanders,who wants to be the first to enter god's good graces?
53752,Ned Flanders,i was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
54208,Ned Flanders,flantastic times two! how are connie and bonnie?
52986,Ned Flanders,"but reverend, i need to know. is god punishing me?"
53138,Ned Flanders,"uh, listen homer, ah, hate to be a fussy freddy and all, but maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
53866,Ned Flanders,woo hoo!
52874,Ned Flanders,"uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
52639,Ned Flanders,o-kay.
52539,Ned Flanders,fee fi fo fum! i smell the potatoes au gratin of marge simp-son! mmmm- mmm!
52651,Ned Flanders,you'll be history!
53959,Ned Flanders,"please, lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
52544,Ned Flanders,"no, i kid you not. here's the noose i had to wear for ten years."
54267,Ned Flanders,"well homer, you really put one over on old stupid flanders, here. thanks a lot, neighbor."
53576,Ned Flanders,"homer, please don't sue the church. i'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
53776,Ned Flanders,are you even listening to me?!
53561,Ned Flanders,and bless your humble home.
53750,Ned Flanders,"help me out, homer. my little roddy needs his insulin. breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
52761,Ned Flanders,sure didilly do. over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
54452,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpsons! don't mean to be a pesto, but i'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
53326,Ned Flanders,"aw, homer. you don't have to..."
54306,Ned Flanders,and i haven't. not until now.
54414,Ned Flanders,"""life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
54390,Ned Flanders,"homer, you know my parents, capri and nedward."
53225,Ned Flanders,"whew, well, at least i got a hunk of moe's hair."
53787,Ned Flanders,"well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-rapture party."
54316,Ned Flanders,that's just fine as long as you're not a mormon!
54532,Ned Flanders,"hey, there's homer simpson! oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
52932,Ned Flanders,"well, hey, it's homer! good to see ya, neighb--"
53792,Ned Flanders,"oh-uh-uh... sorry maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. it's one of my humble figurines."
53248,Ned Flanders,"maude, it's a miracle! the lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"
54015,Ned Flanders,not bad.
54198,Ned Flanders,de-meat those feet!
54145,Ned Flanders,"lord, please help homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
54299,Ned Flanders,"homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?"
53119,Ned Flanders,"looks like slim pickin's today, reverend."
52736,Ned Flanders,"that's what you're smelling, homer! oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
54431,Ned Flanders,"you know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? well, sir, i want you to rid of lisa's bully teacher."
53500,Ned Flanders,all right officer.
53949,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!
54464,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily.
54272,Ned Flanders,"edna, i had a long walk with homer simpson yesterday, and as i was carrying him back home, i had a lot of time to think."
53361,Ned Flanders,"well, that, that sounds real nice, rachel, but a... i'm a... i'm not quite..."
53444,Ned Flanders,here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
52751,Ned Flanders,what?
54177,Ned Flanders,i've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of noah's ark!
52998,Ned Flanders,"oh, now, calm down neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... they did their best... shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! can't you morons do anything right?!!"
53863,Ned Flanders,this is my favorite kind of surprise: mild!
53642,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm not sure i want to do it. i mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" you know, the cow being me."
52624,Ned Flanders,"here, marge, let me. hate to be an armchair blanche, but i always gave it one of these..."
53717,Ned Flanders,concussion... diddily... hemorrhage... doodily... injury... bodily...
54490,Ned Flanders,christmas is my busy season. sold three pairs of scissors this month! two came back.
53819,Ned Flanders,the flanders family has pulled up stakes. you have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
53704,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess it wouldn't kill me to let you in."
52583,Ned Flanders,"yes, sir!"
53782,Ned Flanders,yes... but my mower can't get much lower!
52930,Ned Flanders,"thankily-dank, mayor, i shan't disappoint. har ye, har ye! i declare myself pickled tink about springfield's bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial day!"
54222,Ned Flanders,that feeling is mutual of omaha.
53544,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, i've been singing your praises all day. marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
52860,Ned Flanders,that's a good one.
53496,Ned Flanders,so you are running a day care center?
52565,Ned Flanders,"twenty? homer, i paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
53040,Ned Flanders,"well, what do you say, homer? can lisa babysit for my kids?"
52730,Ned Flanders,here's our chance! dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
54245,Ned Flanders,"whoa, slow down. i never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
53724,Ned Flanders,"uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
54549,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'm a chicken, am i?"
54497,Ned Flanders,my best friend is a great runner!
54381,Ned Flanders,"hey, neighbor, your welcome mat's lookin' a little dusty."
53349,Ned Flanders,"well, i just can't relate to the women of today, homer. ah, it's probably me. i'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
54039,Ned Flanders,"as the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!"
52796,Ned Flanders,"well, let me just say i want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
54409,Ned Flanders,no -- not surf and murph!
54029,Ned Flanders,lucky guess.
52805,Ned Flanders,we might as well make it official.
52561,Ned Flanders,are you sure you're not interested? two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
52916,Ned Flanders,"oh, marge. of course homer's alive. he's alive in all our hearts."
52875,Ned Flanders,"no, son. no sirree, bob."
54036,Ned Flanders,perez became the father of hezron. hezron became the father of ram.
53239,Ned Flanders,you heard me.
54183,Ned Flanders,"i spy, with my electronic eye, illegal wagering!"
53664,Ned Flanders,"then i doubt you'll like ned flanders / or his creepy little offspring, rod and todd..."
54450,Ned Flanders,can you teach my boys? but no tickling the ivories. you treat them with respect.
53683,Ned Flanders,brother ned's got cheese on bread / and a side order of shame...
53634,Ned Flanders,"hop to it, honey! if we get to the pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
53800,Ned Flanders,"wait, this is my license!"
53366,Ned Flanders,yeah. just answer me this: are you holding your mooching sack?
52833,Ned Flanders,"i may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
54143,Ned Flanders,"okay, let's just put it to a vote."
52600,Ned Flanders,is this all he watches?
53541,Ned Flanders,"doo-da, doo-da..."
54238,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'm afraid my maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now."
53929,Ned Flanders,"start 'er up, boys!"
53062,Ned Flanders,uh... homer?
53185,Ned Flanders,"if he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp."
53872,Ned Flanders,hiya marge. rod and todd in the land of nod?
54057,Ned Flanders,lock onto his wiener.
53316,Ned Flanders,no foot-longs!
53723,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can foretell people's deaths!"
53588,Ned Flanders,"okay, i've got two of every animal. but only males -- i don't want any hanky-panky. hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
53369,Ned Flanders,"actually, homer, you and i worship the same god, so..."
52872,Ned Flanders,"oh, bart. i know you're still getting adjusted here. tell you what. we'll do whatever you want to do."
54252,Ned Flanders,"that's right, i'm down to my wife-blesser."
53806,Ned Flanders,that's odd.
52945,Ned Flanders,"well, now realistically, homer, i've lived here some 30-odd years. this is the first and only bear i've ever seen."
54103,Ned Flanders,diddily...
54160,Ned Flanders,you come all the way to jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
54236,Ned Flanders,"homer? yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... i guess. so, what say we have lunch?"
52999,Ned Flanders,"well, my family and i can't live in good intentions, marge! oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
53886,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the jungle gym / i'll make it safe again / when playtime is a safe time, everybody wins..."
52672,Ned Flanders,it's been four thousand days since my last drink. it was my first and last blackberry schnapps.
52737,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! that's a dilly of a pickle. hey, let's conference you with marge, huh?"
52549,Ned Flanders,"oh, no. the springfield mall."
54083,Ned Flanders,"you two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, christian but not baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
53189,Ned Flanders,"aw, leave me out of this, homer. games of chance are strictly forbidden by deuteronomy seven--"
54239,Ned Flanders,"besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... the leftorium. we've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
52618,Ned Flanders,"oh, indeedily-doodily. i've even been in ""streetcar"" once before. i played blanche dubois! hmmm huh. just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
53096,Ned Flanders,"well, nothing's perfect, i sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
53646,Ned Flanders,that's what maude used to say.
53705,Ned Flanders,"well, he's got me there."
53987,Ned Flanders,zippin' it up!
53961,Ned Flanders,springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! starting with... gluttony!
53757,Ned Flanders,they warned me satan would be attractive. let's go.
53925,Ned Flanders,isn't this your posse on this glossy?
53669,Ned Flanders,the house is slightly askew! to the panic room!
54037,Ned Flanders,"howdy-do, strangers! hop on in before you become a couple runneth over!"
54030,Ned Flanders,for the last few weeks. but most of the time i've known you you've treated me like dirt!
54496,Ned Flanders,this is a whole new relationship for us! we'll be friends! in this life and the next!
52608,Ned Flanders,"okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. i'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
54270,Ned Flanders,maybe we should just call it a night.
53903,Ned Flanders,excuse me. how can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the bible?
53516,Ned Flanders,"whoops. watch the swears, honey bear. we don't use the ""i"" word in this house."
54377,Ned Flanders,don't eat the miracle!
52891,Ned Flanders,jes... ? jes... ? don't you kids know anything? the serpent of rehaboam? the well of zohassadar? the bridal feast of beth chadruharazzeb?
53775,Ned Flanders,"yeah. i made a great film, but i'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. i'm like michael moore, except i'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and god loves me. i just wish i could find some way to spread my message."
53524,Ned Flanders,bring it in!
54149,Ned Flanders,bleh.
54412,Ned Flanders,i know what i must do.
54408,Ned Flanders,was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? that's what i wanna know.
54035,Ned Flanders,...abraham became the father of isaac. isaac became the father of jacob. jacob became the father of judah and his brothers. judah became the father of perez and zerah by tamar.
53171,Ned Flanders,"how 'bout it, homer? will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
53008,Ned Flanders,noooooooooooo!
53871,Ned Flanders,"um, one box?"
53885,Ned Flanders,i don't want you watching my boys ever again!
52580,Ned Flanders,for two more days. then it becomes libertarian party headquarters. i hope they have better luck than i did.
53657,Ned Flanders,i walked right into that one.
52567,Ned Flanders,"all right, homer."
54470,Ned Flanders,"i told you, the only dancing i like is ""square."""
54388,Ned Flanders,why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
53551,Ned Flanders,"i don't know, neighboreenos, i'm all for halloween fun, but a séance sounds a little pg-13."
52582,Ned Flanders,homer?
52961,Ned Flanders,"uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
52979,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly. oo, i better go take down the manger scene. if baby jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
53359,Ned Flanders,i-i recently lost my wife.
54046,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer, i'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds."
53428,Ned Flanders,"now wait just a maude-gone minute, here. i'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
53301,Ned Flanders,"you saw ""ben-hur"" without me?"
54201,Ned Flanders,i guess i did create this... like god created the devil.
52899,Ned Flanders,"do you reject satan, and all his empty promises?"
52604,Ned Flanders,"no, i-i came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
53680,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe just a tad, todd."
53612,Ned Flanders,"oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least i can do."
52740,Ned Flanders,"what do you think, reverend?"
53659,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, writing a new christmas carol?"
53104,Ned Flanders,that's good enough for me.
53746,Ned Flanders,"you know i was gonna enter this here ovenfresh bakeoff... but up against you, i wouldn't have a hindu's chance in heaven."
53845,Ned Flanders,"okily-dokily, here's some french roast, now i'll go make toast."
53859,Ned Flanders,"my lp of ""dreamcoat!"""
52866,Ned Flanders,yes. eat all of our shirts.
52685,Ned Flanders,"no, ned flanders."
54557,Ned Flanders,"good gravy, what have i done?"
53289,Ned Flanders,i move we reconsider our club name. make it something a little less blasphemous. after all we don't want to go to hell.
53844,Ned Flanders,it's seven a.m. what are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
53353,Ned Flanders,"no, i'm not kidding. i am gonna sit right here and miss church. you just watch."
52818,Ned Flanders,murdered?
54154,Ned Flanders,"homer, quit playing that back."
53731,Ned Flanders,"i was supposed to shoot you, but i didn't! i changed the future!"
53833,Ned Flanders,"now coach, i've tried to be christian and respectful, but i guess i'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. legally, i still own this house."
52901,Ned Flanders,"oh, fair enough."
54586,Ned Flanders,"well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. but sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
54031,Ned Flanders,i forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
53557,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer!"
53554,Ned Flanders,"say homer, i was, uh, i was wondering if i could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me."
54363,Ned Flanders,"unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
53690,Ned Flanders,that tears it. i'll show homer. i'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
52633,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, i heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
52674,Ned Flanders,i was more animal than man.
52564,Ned Flanders,"ah, got your eye on the gas grill. she's a butane beaut."
54486,Ned Flanders,it's the name of the freezer!
54017,Ned Flanders,"lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
53897,Ned Flanders,please! somebody take 'em!
53039,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't know, lisa. you're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. todd's been pinching everyone lately."
53486,Ned Flanders,"how 'bout i explain it to you over a cup of coffee. that is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
54554,Ned Flanders,"you have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!"
52969,Ned Flanders,howdilly-doodilly.
53546,Ned Flanders,"well, nice work, inspector find-it. did you catch the thief?"
52974,Ned Flanders,shoot!
54048,Ned Flanders,"goodnight, marge."
53722,Ned Flanders,well i didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
54101,Ned Flanders,"no, it's angels food with chocolate on top."
52689,Ned Flanders,"you know, reverend, this really isn't a hymn."
53935,Ned Flanders,"this is it, boys -- one more out and we go to the championship game. let's do it for groundskeeper willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
52535,Ned Flanders,well...
53330,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're right. i've just got to work through the grief. there's not gonna be an easy answer."
53826,Ned Flanders,homer? what are you doing here?
54126,Ned Flanders,thank you all for coming.
54168,Ned Flanders,"ooo, looks like a sandstorm's brewin'. i'll just wait it out at a movie."
54481,Ned Flanders,say no more.
54159,Ned Flanders,that's it. i'm losin' it. i'm losin' it!
53346,Ned Flanders,"mmm. dinner was delicious, edna, but i can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get principal skinner jealous."
53310,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho, true enough. but, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
53580,Ned Flanders,"and rev, you'll be bunkin' with me!"
54403,Ned Flanders,that's the plug for the light!
53894,Ned Flanders,"lord, with you watching over me i shall feel no pain."
52569,Ned Flanders,what?
53434,Ned Flanders,"mmm... i love chenille, don't you?"
53810,Ned Flanders,you soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. and sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
53031,Ned Flanders,...help out. what can i do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey?
53485,Ned Flanders,"hey, your hair's grown back real nice."
53527,Ned Flanders,"hidilly-hey, homer!"
54207,Ned Flanders,"howdy, cousin ted!"
52937,Ned Flanders,hmm. i seem to have mashed more hair into it. oh well.
53504,Ned Flanders,wow.
52706,Ned Flanders,"ooh, careful there, marge! almost nicked me!"
53294,Ned Flanders,that shy little imp?
53162,Ned Flanders,"oh, can you believe it? it almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady neddy."
52864,Ned Flanders,"well, a friendly springfield hello there, neighbors. i, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
52789,Ned Flanders,okilly-dokilly.
52838,Ned Flanders,"que sera, sera / whatever will be, will be / the future's not ours to see..."
53971,Ned Flanders,"that concludes our halloween show for this year. i just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to hell. and that includes fx, fox sports and our newest devil's portal, the wall street journal! welcome to the club!"
54075,Ned Flanders,let's see what else is on.
54472,Ned Flanders,sure do miss that laugh.
53019,Ned Flanders,"hi, neighbor!"
52683,Ned Flanders,oh...the network slogan is true. watch fox and be damned for all eternity.
54230,Ned Flanders,did a volcano erupt in candyland? 'cause i just caught me a flyin' red hot!
53681,Ned Flanders,"one problem at a time, boy."
54530,Ned Flanders,and then i turn into a snarling beast. talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
53067,Ned Flanders,"little higher, wendell... a lot higher, martin... ah, ralph, that's a basketball."
53840,Ned Flanders,"oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. like the jews with their snippity-snip."
53041,Ned Flanders,"oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! oh, and todd's as dry as a bone! lisa, you're a wonder! i'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
53635,Ned Flanders,"sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
54286,Ned Flanders,"patty and selma?! sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
54410,Ned Flanders,the answer to my woe must be in here.
53607,Ned Flanders,"well sir, that's very encouraging but i can't date a movie star. i'm no arthur miller or lyle lovett."
53332,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but i feel like i've turned a corner."
54384,Ned Flanders,and the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
52686,Ned Flanders,i'll never have that problem again.
53843,Ned Flanders,my pleasure.
53271,Ned Flanders,"""discotheques,"" ""frat houses,"" ""malibu."" nothing about satellite fires!"
52540,Ned Flanders,"heya, homer!"
53542,Ned Flanders,that's better.
54329,Ned Flanders,"lord, forgive me for my pride. all-wise, as always, you have rightly raised homer above me."
53791,Ned Flanders,"yeah, so i can't see my own shrinky dink."
54375,Ned Flanders,look a little closer.
54076,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is good."
54428,Ned Flanders,"you wanna hit me. well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
53975,Ned Flanders,"hey, can i give you folks a lift?"
54193,Ned Flanders,"sour ball, take me away!"
53449,Ned Flanders,but where do you put something that big?
53258,Ned Flanders,he taught us how to live a burt reynolds lifestyle on a mac davis income. we've already got tickets for his next seminar.
53468,Ned Flanders,how 'bout a maude mask?
52905,Ned Flanders,and this is lord thistlewick flanders...
54361,Ned Flanders,"name's ned flanders, i've heard of you. haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
53178,Ned Flanders,"okay, homer. i'm ready to learn. what's the first lesson? just give me the topic sentence."
54276,Ned Flanders,i started drinking orange juice with pulp! i asked the reverend and he said it was okay. then he hung right up on me. that man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
54337,Ned Flanders,'cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
54382,Ned Flanders,mind if i come over and sweeten your greetin'. sweeten your greetin'! sweeten your greetin'!
53105,Ned Flanders,purple drapes! all my life i've wanted purple drapes!
53529,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, of course he could... but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
54562,Ned Flanders,'fraid so infinity plus one.
53234,Ned Flanders,"well, i'd better skedaddle. oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
53270,Ned Flanders,looks like it. run get daddy's exorcism tongs.
54468,Ned Flanders,not this month! edna signed us up for a tango class. it was the only way i could avert wine tasting.
53219,Ned Flanders,"i don't want to be a panicky pete, but it's sunday and i haven't been to church yet."
53582,Ned Flanders,"no, no, you're lying! you're lying! what makes you lie?"
52556,Ned Flanders,n-not yet. but one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
53348,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, maybe i'll call you again."
54068,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i'd better be..."
52952,Ned Flanders,okily dokily.
54161,Ned Flanders,delete! delete! delete!
53032,Ned Flanders,"uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
53307,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm. that's the one! they've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. ooh, cost us a bundle, too. i guess we'll have an ""imagination christmas"" this year."
53518,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's not you talkin'. that's the honey-mustard dressing!"
52911,Ned Flanders,yeah. a crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
52893,Ned Flanders,jeepers h. crackers! i'd better call the reverend!
54257,Ned Flanders,and i'll just take my tumbleweed back...
53709,Ned Flanders,"oh, and another thing..."
53675,Ned Flanders,"i'm dying! and there's heaven. but who's that? confucius? and milton berle? boy, have i been barkin' up the wrong tree."
53805,Ned Flanders,i got phi beta cappuccinos for ned's pre-meds!
53083,Ned Flanders,do you have a problem with the way i'm coaching?
53450,Ned Flanders,"well, what the heck. who's ready to build an amusement park?"
52671,Ned Flanders,my name is ned.
54256,Ned Flanders,language.
53993,Ned Flanders,"yep, i'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
52568,Ned Flanders,twenty dollars.
53341,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm having second thoughts. this feels so disloyal to maude."
53980,Ned Flanders,um... the battery seems to be dead. i'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
53304,Ned Flanders,"uh, listen, homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
53012,Ned Flanders,i can't believe i was such a terror.
53697,Ned Flanders,"""and the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, i bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
53128,Ned Flanders,"yes indeedy. makin' some good scratch, too."
52720,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? want me to zinc your sniffer?"
54573,Ned Flanders,no-sirree-bob!
54157,Ned Flanders,unknown? this is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
54357,Ned Flanders,my moustache / is bristly / my letters / are epistly / and i don't wanna / mislead you / i like to hug and kissly--
53049,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help..."
53670,Ned Flanders,scared of what? all the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? we'll be safe inside our fortress when they come / we'll be safe from creeps and killers when they come / unless they have a blowtorch / or a poison gas injector / then i don't know what'll happen when they come!
54133,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! you are the most infuriating, netflix-d.v.d.-burgling, barbecue-not-putting-out..."
53097,Ned Flanders,i guess it is sorta cute...
54533,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i'm sorry to bother you at this hour but i threw a man out of my house today. i feel like i've violated matthew 19:19."
54430,Ned Flanders,edna!

53905,Ned Flanders,no one was ever a monkey! everything is what it was and always will be! god put us here and that's that!
52620,Ned Flanders,roger-dodger.
53005,Ned Flanders,"homer, you are the worst human being i have ever met."
52808,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, what's the big brouhaha? ha."
52653,Ned Flanders,"if you need anything, just give a whistle."
54010,Ned Flanders,i like their christian cover band: a.d.-b.c.! kindly deeds / done for free / kindly deeds
54113,Ned Flanders,"well, see ya 'round the mailbox, marge."
53590,Ned Flanders,"well, guess i might as well head back to my store. i've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
53615,Ned Flanders,yep. now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of scrabble.
53035,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely-do.
52962,Ned Flanders,"that's dignity, all right."
54504,Ned Flanders,"ow. oh, simpson, it's you."
52748,Ned Flanders,"oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so i can report it on my income tax?"
53832,Ned Flanders,"so you see mr. roberts, i really would like my house back."
54128,Ned Flanders,"today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of matthew twenty-three."
54180,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, that's your salad fork!... that wi-fi's for hotel guests only!... what's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""happy birthday?"""
54092,Ned Flanders,the simpsons are back!
54182,Ned Flanders,ahem!
53038,Ned Flanders,"well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but i have to drive to capital city, fill out some forms to get 'em out. could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
54572,Ned Flanders,"simpson, what a pleasant surprise. we were just pulling taffy."
53169,Ned Flanders,"here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, homer. but i, i was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
53252,Ned Flanders,everything but the opinion page! i don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
53136,Ned Flanders,"easy, ned, don't breathe in."
54065,Ned Flanders,"say homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
54122,Ned Flanders,"you know marge, maude and i had a fight right before she died..."
53620,Ned Flanders,exact-a-tically-tacally!
54176,Ned Flanders,uh-oh.
52728,Ned Flanders,"again? homer, we have to ration the water carefully. it's our only hope."
54054,Ned Flanders,"okay, here she comes! why don't you take marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
53633,Ned Flanders,well of course. wait a minute. this is to adopt two of your kids.
53133,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, why, everything! policemen, trees, sunshine. and let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', god bless 'em."
53721,Ned Flanders,"lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
54234,Ned Flanders,"so, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""flanders arms."""
52663,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
54021,Ned Flanders,"you know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
52914,Ned Flanders,homer's passing...away.
52769,Ned Flanders,"eh, well sir. my entire family is very touched and--"
53121,Ned Flanders,"well, this is my rumpus room."
53311,Ned Flanders,"yes, son."
52810,Ned Flanders,i wish there was some other explanation for this. but there isn't. i'm a murderer! i'm a murderer!
53939,Ned Flanders,you just fetch it!
52884,Ned Flanders,which version shall it be?
54507,Ned Flanders,"well, happy holidays, simpson."
54342,Ned Flanders,"okay simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause i think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
54534,Ned Flanders,love thy neighbor.
53320,Ned Flanders,what are you saying?
52870,Ned Flanders,mmm-hmm. all we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
53483,Ned Flanders,i've gotta close praiseland down. someone could get hurt.
53358,Ned Flanders,"uh, that was a lovely song. it really got to me."
54508,Ned Flanders,you bet.
53275,Ned Flanders,"you can't kill the undead, silly."
53070,Ned Flanders,"and, uh, bart, you'll be a tackle."
54063,Ned Flanders,so i can rent it back to you. just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
54205,Ned Flanders,knock-a-doodle-you!
54242,Ned Flanders,"well thank you for taking me to that pinkberry place. it's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
54146,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
53513,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, i know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. but, uh, i know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so i will."
53684,Ned Flanders,where the h-e-c-k is everybody?
53209,Ned Flanders,how are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent--
52708,Ned Flanders,"well it's bart simpson! c'mon in! you're just in time for ""sponge bath the old folks day!"""
54415,Ned Flanders,i would embrace such a glad visit!
53381,Ned Flanders,"oh, no, homer, remember? maudie got called up to heaven."
52853,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is a dilly of a pickle."
52628,Ned Flanders,i'm trying... i'm trying...
54317,Ned Flanders,bedbugs? just why is there a bed in city hall?
53817,Ned Flanders,i wish we lived in a place more like the america of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us republicans.
53407,Ned Flanders,ow! it's one-way!
54024,Ned Flanders,homer!
53624,Ned Flanders,can i call you jim?
54070,Ned Flanders,"when i was putting new insulation in your attic, i slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
53562,Ned Flanders,"well, cock-a-diddily-doo! what a marge-alicious way to start my flander-rific day."
52669,Ned Flanders,"hey homie, i can see your doodle!"
54142,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's not why we're here. we can see the stations of the cross!"
53283,Ned Flanders,they can be a handful... of joy.
52775,Ned Flanders,oh! almost. boy that was close.
54501,Ned Flanders,"see marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
53983,Ned Flanders,"as the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. i spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these hardy boys books."
54121,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, it looks like your dad is a quotable notable."
53793,Ned Flanders,"he scampered out of parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
53181,Ned Flanders,"thanks, buddy."
53037,Ned Flanders,"homer, i've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. y'know, maude and her mother were visiting tyre and sidon, the twin cities of the holy land. they must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
54009,Ned Flanders,"homer, i don't think we have the same musical tastes."
54019,Ned Flanders,"homer, no! you promised... everything was supposed to be by the book!"
53238,Ned Flanders,"doggone it, eve, i think you'd better hightail it outta this garden!"
54300,Ned Flanders,"y'know, i knew a backstabbin' buckeye named roz at bible camp. twice as tall as she should've been."
53433,Ned Flanders,this should keep you toasty.
53287,Ned Flanders,"well, if i were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
54233,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm a truthful kinda guy."
53324,Ned Flanders,"hey, that's my sprinkler."
52909,Ned Flanders,"well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- i'm stumped."
54264,Ned Flanders,you all know edna?
53072,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
52829,Ned Flanders,"i kinda figured this might happen, so i built the shelter big enough for both our families."
54321,Ned Flanders,"hidilly-ho, dream team!"
53510,Ned Flanders,"well, christmas is coming, huh?"
52922,Ned Flanders,"well, looks like somebody sold something today."
53106,Ned Flanders,"well, neighborinos, i guess this is goodbye... i better make this quick or i'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
54107,Ned Flanders,then i give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go!
52588,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens."
53488,Ned Flanders,"so, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?"
53103,Ned Flanders,"well, marge?"
53609,Ned Flanders,huh.
54266,Ned Flanders,wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
54296,Ned Flanders,could this get any worse?
52847,Ned Flanders,"thanks, god."
53713,Ned Flanders,"well, that's good too, i guess."
54451,Ned Flanders,all right! a chance to make a new friend!
52641,Ned Flanders,help! help!
53992,Ned Flanders,bullet-proof glass.
53825,Ned Flanders,you know what? i'm not gonna. my mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
54559,Ned Flanders,"no, you will."
54333,Ned Flanders,"no atheist blood, please."
52584,Ned Flanders,"homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. but you made us friends."
53255,Ned Flanders,"oh, we're not as well-off as you think. we give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. and the leftorium's business has gone way downhill since leftopolis moved in next door."
53768,Ned Flanders,"your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
53909,Ned Flanders,they're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. even though there's nothing about it in the bible!
53740,Ned Flanders,do it! do it! kill everyone!
53641,Ned Flanders,"homer, sara wants us to have s-e-x."
53573,Ned Flanders,that cuts the mustard with me.
54110,Ned Flanders,saved by the bell from eternity in hell!
52988,Ned Flanders,son of a gun-diddily-un! those gilded edges smart!
52675,Ned Flanders,"hi-ho pagans! new years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
53947,Ned Flanders,hey homer!
54008,Ned Flanders,bible salesman!
53552,Ned Flanders,"well, i do miss the mrs..."
54339,Ned Flanders,"boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with."
53338,Ned Flanders,"homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? it just feels way too soon."
54073,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm sorry, i just had my glass of warm milk which means i am closed for business!"
53884,Ned Flanders,he chipped a tooth! how will he bite wheat thins? how?
54582,Ned Flanders,"you know, that's exactly what i --"
54537,Ned Flanders,"i don't blame you for being upset with me, homer. i just wanted to give you this letter. i'll leave now."
53268,Ned Flanders,it's not working! it just spreads the flame!
52611,Ned Flanders,... so recycling is our way of giving mother earth a great big hug.
52929,Ned Flanders,who? maude and me?
54040,Ned Flanders,"put 'er there, muddy buddy."
54045,Ned Flanders,"well, when the sun goes down it means god's gone to china to watch over those good folks. time for some shuteye."
54301,Ned Flanders,"it is! but if you've got the stones, i can tell you how to slay that gal-ioth."
53875,Ned Flanders,what are you doing?! you're gonna get hurt!
53251,Ned Flanders,"well, this goes right into the old poor box."
54155,Ned Flanders,"and lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. and thank you, again, for the challenge of homer simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. me homer, you the cross. and now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
52867,Ned Flanders,dear lord. that's the loudest profanity i've ever heard.
54067,Ned Flanders,"try 'er now, marge."
52698,Ned Flanders,howdy gents. what can i diddily do you for?
53759,Ned Flanders,"not that convenience store crap, is it? because i don't feed that to my dogs."
54543,Ned Flanders,"so, my little bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?"
52921,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. well, i... uh, i guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
52822,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos."
53180,Ned Flanders,"ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. i'd better call maude and tell her where i am."
53818,Ned Flanders,"""made in humbleton, pa."" i don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that i bought at a garage sale. but corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
52835,Ned Flanders,"no, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
53055,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
53658,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i think you want your house, next door."
52725,Ned Flanders,uh-oh... no time.
52721,Ned Flanders,"i guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
54061,Ned Flanders,three... two... one... it's ash wednesday everybody! set down your gins and confess your sins!
53006,Ned Flanders,i attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. i'd like to commit myself.
53931,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish! no, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
52783,Ned Flanders,i think we should leave.
54129,Ned Flanders,"now let us ""download"" the holy ""tweet"" of the lord."
53732,Ned Flanders,what have i done? i've changed the future for the worse.
53899,Ned Flanders,"wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there homer..."
54279,Ned Flanders,spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
53916,Ned Flanders,"you win, lisa."
53029,Ned Flanders,"we'll see, son. we'll see."
54579,Ned Flanders,"i should box your ears you, you, you... you sneaky pete!"
52982,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, everyone's alive. guess that's something to be thankful for."
53086,Ned Flanders,you mean like... an angel?!!
53371,Ned Flanders,six months ago. you were at the funeral. you fell into the grave.
53302,Ned Flanders,"well, that's no..."
53470,Ned Flanders,bye bye.
53549,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely.
54343,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry honey, but i'm stuck in this meeting of the springfield l.g.b.t. the left-gifted, bidextrous, and transhanded community. we're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""left is right"" parade."
53534,Ned Flanders,"well, okay... i, i guess it would go something like this: all right, simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
53117,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho. no problem, marge. oh."
54538,Ned Flanders,"hi, simpson! having fun?"
54304,Ned Flanders,peace be with you.
53865,Ned Flanders,"well sir, we could do a little quid pro for the kay-pro. the left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of springfield's largest southpaw shop, i just gotta be there. could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
54173,Ned Flanders,okily dokily.
53199,Ned Flanders,"look at this place! we must have really painted the town last night. i have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and i don't remember a thing!"
53962,Ned Flanders,anger!
52606,Ned Flanders,what's wrong with my moustache?
54278,Ned Flanders,"springfield. my home town. pretty little place. although, even the garden of eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
53762,Ned Flanders,"here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off."
53503,Ned Flanders,"gee, i always like to help you, homer, but i don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. and it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
52830,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly doodilly neighbors. shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
52873,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess a little television won't hurt. i used to let the boys watch ""my three sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
53525,Ned Flanders,"now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of trojans."
52724,Ned Flanders,"oh, quick, homer! which way do we turn--?"
54013,Ned Flanders,hm. i've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
54445,Ned Flanders,we've lost him.
53767,Ned Flanders,"now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of cain and abel!"
53599,Ned Flanders,"a woman askin' a man out? well, well why not. and maybe i'll eat my steak with a spoon."
54087,Ned Flanders,folks...
54001,Ned Flanders,we have to do everything by the book.
54006,Ned Flanders,our first bail jumper!
54482,Ned Flanders,"well, we pulled more plugs than a dutch doctor. now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
52817,Ned Flanders,"what the gumdrops is going on, here?"
54258,Ned Flanders,"i don't wanna come here. last time i did, someone slipped me a mickey and wrote ""churchy joe"" on my face."
54432,Ned Flanders,i'm glad the only beef between us is this burger!
53073,Ned Flanders,"well, actually, lisa, these balls are synthetic."
54151,Ned Flanders,"yes, but it means more to you."
54462,Ned Flanders,"actually, half a kiosk. sharing it with nasreen here."
53940,Ned Flanders,"okay, ""smallville""... super dog licks himself. that definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
53054,Ned Flanders,"yeah, it's ned flanders. the teens have been chasing me all night. they finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
54366,Ned Flanders,homer! is that my camera?
53190,Ned Flanders,"oh, i got a bunch, homer, but i just don't feel right ab... oh, lord, what should i do?"
53145,Ned Flanders,hmm. that's odd. it didn't come out the rear end.
53380,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you know... magic, fortune telling, oriental cooking..."
52744,Ned Flanders,"now, who should lead the group?"
53206,Ned Flanders,"homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?"
52907,Ned Flanders,"congratulations, homer. your q is a huge success. a toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
53753,Ned Flanders,well where's your super-team now?
53745,Ned Flanders,"marge, you know i thought i was springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
53839,Ned Flanders,bart and homer can't go catholic! the romans have been separate from us since the schism of lourdes in 1573. and that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. which we've since abolished.
52617,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy-do neighbor."
53095,Ned Flanders,"well, shall we sing a hymn? uh, ""nearer my god to thee"", maybe? or, or, or ""amazing grace""?"
53849,Ned Flanders,"you betcha! in fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
52598,Ned Flanders,where in the bible?
53846,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, why the sour puss? didja chugalug a skunky snapple?"
53406,Ned Flanders,"look, if you want me to turn, just point. that w..."
53881,Ned Flanders,i just can't. they're all i've got since that sad day when maude found eternal happiness.
52532,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! care to try some of my flanders planters punch?"
53143,Ned Flanders,"now, the secret to the windmill hole is to--"
52541,Ned Flanders,"okay, thanks for comin'!"
53192,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o. one betting disk please."
53001,Ned Flanders,do i hear the sound of butting in? it's gotta be little lisa simpson -- springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
53536,Ned Flanders,the camptown ladies sing this song...
53477,Ned Flanders,"homer, no! i can't exploit a divine manifestation."
53896,Ned Flanders,i'll throw in some christian comic books!
54396,Ned Flanders,that's cross-legged music!
52649,Ned Flanders,"ah, homer, why don't you plow it again?"
53530,Ned Flanders,"well, luckily, i've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
54535,Ned Flanders,"a gentle answer. well, that is a jim-dandy idea. bless you, reverend."
52680,Ned Flanders,"i wish he were, rod, i pray for the day, but i'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
54283,Ned Flanders,and so white-bread ned became the avenging sword of the lord.
52621,Ned Flanders,aww... isn't that cute? and me without a camera.
52987,Ned Flanders,"even in my darkest hour, i can turn to the good book for..."
53329,Ned Flanders,"if i'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here."
52855,Ned Flanders,we do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right here.
53440,Ned Flanders,always do.
52956,Ned Flanders,"pays for itself after the 16th visit. you know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. but i do. now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
53784,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. you'll have to call me a ray-theist, 'cause i don't believe i saw him."
53043,Ned Flanders,you did? just a minute. what time can you come over?
54248,Ned Flanders,"but i think if we hold off for a while, you'll find i'm well worth the wait. like a mild cheddar i get tangy when i'm sittin' on the shelf."
52732,Ned Flanders,"thank you, homer, i dunno what got--"
53502,Ned Flanders,you're using my table saw to violate a court order?
53191,Ned Flanders,j-- what?
54196,Ned Flanders,"rod? hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
54303,Ned Flanders,"thank you. now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth sunday after easter. we'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment i wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
53898,Ned Flanders,"hi-dilly ho, simpsons!"
53370,Ned Flanders,"well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
53221,Ned Flanders,i can't believe it. we're actually in the winning locker room!
52782,Ned Flanders,"i can't do it, maude. i can't face their accusing eyes."
53944,Ned Flanders,to: online christian soldiers... subject: televised super swear...
53229,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers!"
52890,Ned Flanders,"well, guess! book of revelations... fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... who else is it gonna be?!"
54186,Ned Flanders,don't use that dog as a ramp...
52613,Ned Flanders,"ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
53250,Ned Flanders,"well, hi-diddly..."
53403,Ned Flanders,"jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
52648,Ned Flanders,"thank you, plow king-a-lee-ding."
54395,Ned Flanders,funyuns?! little debbies?!
53812,Ned Flanders,the whole town is laughing at me behind my back. i guess you're the only real friend i have.
54322,Ned Flanders,"homer, when am i gettin' my power drill back?"
53509,Ned Flanders,maybe never.
54084,Ned Flanders,my ballpoint is all clicked-up for you.
53984,Ned Flanders,okily dokily!
54081,Ned Flanders,"uh, say, ""jesus,"" what was the name of the son of zachariah?"
52681,Ned Flanders,i can't imagine what we could've done to... oh... oh no!
53308,Ned Flanders,"ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor..."
52790,Ned Flanders,it's the four elephants of the apocalypse!
54178,Ned Flanders,maybe. but i feel a little like i'm the tom voyeur to these huckleberry sinners.
52749,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighbor. wanna go to the game with me? i got two tic..."
53220,Ned Flanders,"well, not, not my cup of..."
53455,Ned Flanders,"oh, bless you, sir."
53508,Ned Flanders,"my satan sense is tingling! into the root cellar, boys!"
53570,Ned Flanders,"oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
54011,Ned Flanders,kindly deeds / done for free
53456,Ned Flanders,"ah, gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene."
54004,Ned Flanders,did you just taser my coffee?
54564,Ned Flanders,"it's okay, son. you can recover."
54476,Ned Flanders,you'll only taste the spoon!
52756,Ned Flanders,"stan, tell you what -- homer simpson here is just about the biggest atom fan that's ever graced god's green earth. i bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
54285,Ned Flanders,"heavenly father, i..."
53058,Ned Flanders,tell maude i want a fancy funeral. big coffin. lotsa jewels.
52975,Ned Flanders,howdilly-doodily...
52652,Ned Flanders,"buenos dias, neighboritos. the handle's flanders, but my friends call me ned."
54558,Ned Flanders,"actually, simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt."
52548,Ned Flanders,"well, i know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
54109,Ned Flanders,what's the next task on the old i-dinnerary?
54281,Ned Flanders,"all these years i thought murder was a sin. then, i got new instructions from the good lord himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- english."
54494,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer! unto us this day, a neighbor is born! but why?"
54424,Ned Flanders,now you're rhyming?!
53701,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
53278,Ned Flanders,"ooo, better pick up the pace."
52709,Ned Flanders,"now, just breathe into him every three seconds. make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
53677,Ned Flanders,"well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans."
52766,Ned Flanders,"homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at moe's tonight."
53112,Ned Flanders,"ahh, of course! this must be where he dropped the dagger. and this is the butler's pantry where mrs. astor concealed herself. and right here's where they found the torso heap! in front of our very own fireplace!"
53061,Ned Flanders,amen.
53203,Ned Flanders,i okeley dokely shmokely do!
53694,Ned Flanders,"well, actually, i picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
53539,Ned Flanders,"oh, let's just take it from the top."
52857,Ned Flanders,"bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... oh my lord!! something horrible has happened!"
53253,Ned Flanders,"evening, neighbor. low on funds again?"
53314,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't care for the speed, but i can't get enough of that safety gear. helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
54144,Ned Flanders,"i can't believe we lost, reverend."
53116,Ned Flanders,there goes christmas dinner.
53015,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy, homer!"
54399,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. now, do you mind if i pray at your bedside?"
52642,Ned Flanders,"homer, god didn't set your house on fire."
54095,Ned Flanders,iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily...
54158,Ned Flanders,"porky pig's not a man, he's a pig! and he's not even a real pig!"
52953,Ned Flanders,'bye-diddly-i.
53754,Ned Flanders,but the infinite beauty-- / but the bible says--
53951,Ned Flanders,so it is! i'm just here to pay the fine for the sunday school bus. you towed it with the kids still in it!
52844,Ned Flanders,lucky i was wearing an extra large piece of the true cross today. i think i'll go inside.
53090,Ned Flanders,"thanks anyway, homer."
53918,Ned Flanders,"well, i wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, lisa."
53630,Ned Flanders,"forgive my language, but i am one happy camper!"
53494,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. anyway, thanks again."
53895,Ned Flanders,"only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? well i'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! tell you what, i'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
54213,Ned Flanders,"hey there, neighbor. you look as puffed up as a peacock in a..."
53648,Ned Flanders,uh hmm. that's right. i'm like baskin robbins. you get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
52906,Ned Flanders,can i come?
54289,Ned Flanders,homer simpson!
53799,Ned Flanders,"well, i'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
52800,Ned Flanders,"well, i may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when i was a boy."
53354,Ned Flanders,sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry...
52764,Ned Flanders,"homer, i-i'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night i do my charity work."
52573,Ned Flanders,"say, todd, i want to talk to your uncle homer. you're head of the car till i get back."
53719,Ned Flanders,"just wriggle loose. i'll catch ya, li'l critter!"
54519,Ned Flanders,"there's my little popcorn ball. kissy, kissy."
54226,Ned Flanders,"actually, it's kind of cute. you look like posh spice."
53056,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're leaving! the ordeal is over!"
53941,Ned Flanders,"sixty minutes -- morley safer has questionable pants fold -- ""the l word"" -- used the ""l"" word."
53222,Ned Flanders,i suppose i do take maude for granted.
53231,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho-ho, please. you're gonna give me a swelled head. i just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
54125,Ned Flanders,what about sodom and gomorrah?
53636,Ned Flanders,"well, siegfried and roy create a lot of illusions, but i doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
53030,Ned Flanders,"sure, buddy, i'd be happy to..."
53291,Ned Flanders,the chri... i-i-i don't think you understand my objection...
54210,Ned Flanders,"actually, god made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
53343,Ned Flanders,sherlock holmes is a character.
54005,Ned Flanders,"homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
53345,Ned Flanders,"well, i..."
53904,Ned Flanders,my most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
53512,Ned Flanders,"well, ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
53973,Ned Flanders,"i can't say for sure, but as a christian, i assume the worst."
54475,Ned Flanders,"ah, too much aggravation! we just forego flipped food!"
53772,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. we can put the sound in later."
54191,Ned Flanders,boy cheeks!... fanny!... derriere!... hiney!... backside!... ...cover up that coin slot!
52996,Ned Flanders,"oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway!"
53770,Ned Flanders,"boys, i just talked to god. he's vacuuming heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. and he'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
52622,Ned Flanders,you're a dame and i'm a fella.
54566,Ned Flanders,what are you talking about? neither boy lost.
53585,Ned Flanders,"lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the flanderses. wherever we are, you'll have your church. are you with me, boys?"
52878,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, you gloomy gusses. who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
53922,Ned Flanders,"i... uh... i got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... i'll just pay it."
53333,Ned Flanders,tape?
53367,Ned Flanders,"bart, you're never gonna to grow up if i keep bailing you out."
53167,Ned Flanders,would a silly billy sit like this?
53137,Ned Flanders,oooooh!
52666,Ned Flanders,"if i could give you my heart, homer, i would."
53688,Ned Flanders,pain is the cleanser! pain is the cleanser!
53919,Ned Flanders,what say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?
52576,Ned Flanders,i sold it to you for seven cents.
53372,Ned Flanders,i'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that hollywood hogwash.
53725,Ned Flanders,country parmesan.
53132,Ned Flanders,"hmmm. let's see, cash-register ink. well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? mmm... but then i do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
53213,Ned Flanders,"for the last time, no!"
54466,Ned Flanders,does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
53991,Ned Flanders,even the sing-alongs?
53603,Ned Flanders,psst! homer!
52585,Ned Flanders,"hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?"
54571,Ned Flanders,my son... my son.
53120,Ned Flanders,"hey, i made some rice krispy squares for our hungry deprogramerinos!"
54069,Ned Flanders,"well, as you are my tenants, i'll see what i can do."
54503,Ned Flanders,do you think this looks okay?
53831,Ned Flanders,now you've got a pen pal.
52918,Ned Flanders,"so if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the hibbert table. pronto."
53277,Ned Flanders,i'm making record time on this fog walk!
54241,Ned Flanders,"oh boy, that laugh is infectious. ha!... ha!... that's fun!"
54116,Ned Flanders,just as i feared: her buddhism has led directly to witchcraft.
53284,Ned Flanders,... they'll fill your lives with...
53761,Ned Flanders,"careful, it's hotter than a fox news weather skank."
53378,Ned Flanders,"oh, my goodness!"
52603,Ned Flanders,i'm afraid i have a bone to pick with you.
54134,Ned Flanders,...man i ever met!
54194,Ned Flanders,nothin'. nothin'. somethin'!
53828,Ned Flanders,"well, that is true. in fact--"
53716,Ned Flanders,"well this is one dilly of a daily, lisa. can't wait for tomorrow's!"
53626,Ned Flanders,noooo!
53388,Ned Flanders,i never had a snowplow business.
53300,Ned Flanders,"maude, come quick! the simpsons are covered with cooties!"
53773,Ned Flanders,but who'd know the difference?
54359,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!
53760,Ned Flanders,"no, no, it's home-brewed."
53052,Ned Flanders,"i know, but... they're on their mini-bikes and all..."
54447,Ned Flanders,god doesn't need twitter to reach people. he uses leprosy and plagues.
54546,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, may the best man win."
53853,Ned Flanders,please change me back! this bumble bee has developed an unhealthy obsession with me.
54012,Ned Flanders,kindly deeds / and they're done for free / kindly deeds / and they're done for free
53631,Ned Flanders,"well, what seems to be the problem, officer?"
53088,Ned Flanders,"oh, we can work this out, friends. in the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
53911,Ned Flanders,as familiar as it's proper to be.
52813,Ned Flanders,soon enough.
53074,Ned Flanders,who are we?
53628,Ned Flanders,noooo!
53685,Ned Flanders,wha?
54130,Ned Flanders,duly noted. but we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
53966,Ned Flanders,lust!
52654,Ned Flanders,"well, gee, i..."
52745,Ned Flanders,"i don't really have very much experience, but i'll be---"
54526,Ned Flanders,"uh, knock what off, simpson?"
54020,Ned Flanders,this partnership is over!
53261,Ned Flanders,dang! i should've brought the camera.
53958,Ned Flanders,"no, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
53375,Ned Flanders,did i hear my name? my ears are burnin'.
54298,Ned Flanders,"well, looks like it's time for another ""'end of the walk' talk with homer and ned."" tonight's topic: ""the niceness of the evening."""
54439,Ned Flanders,church songs with clapping... i don't think this is what martin presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his three suggestions under the pope's windshield wiper.
52859,Ned Flanders,yeah.
53924,Ned Flanders,"marge, i hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but i just want to thank you for your early christmas card."
54052,Ned Flanders,so... i'm sure you missed marge last night.
54290,Ned Flanders,you made a killer out of me!
54500,Ned Flanders,she's right. we thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. but we were scathed! those free ginger ales at the casino... i didn't declare them on my taxes!
53528,Ned Flanders,"homer, i-i-it's me, ned."
52616,Ned Flanders,"well, if you ever want to spend the night, maude and i can sleep on card tables."
54456,Ned Flanders,"can i help you, stranger?"
53920,Ned Flanders,whaa -- ?

53682,Ned Flanders,here come sandwiches / here come sandwiches / right down boozy bum lane...
53484,Ned Flanders,nooo!!!
53397,Ned Flanders,we're gonna crash!
53172,Ned Flanders,stop that! will you help me or not?
53489,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer!"
53974,Ned Flanders,what're we gonna do? we can't not vote. nobody does that!
52629,Ned Flanders,aren't you being a little hard on old homie?
54174,Ned Flanders,hot cocoa?
53425,Ned Flanders,"i can hear her, homer."
53387,Ned Flanders,"hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow business?"
52578,Ned Flanders,no it's not.
53501,Ned Flanders,what the...?!
53276,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish. you see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
53627,Ned Flanders,"well, i..."
53066,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho, you betcha. team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
52746,Ned Flanders,hidilly ho!
53964,Ned Flanders,sloth!
53824,Ned Flanders,i'll see what i can do.
54249,Ned Flanders,"well, a little nibble won't hurt your appetite."
53243,Ned Flanders,"oh, shut up. you are so banished."
54509,Ned Flanders,"how do you like my new wheels, simpson?"
52886,Ned Flanders,okay. for one gold star: what persian king exempted the levites from taxation?
53691,Ned Flanders,"i said ""man,"" not ""man-god."" keep your pants on."
53766,Ned Flanders,"there's nothing but filth on tv. but with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
53954,Ned Flanders,i've got something that will scare the h-e-double sippy straws out of them.
53519,Ned Flanders,this is going right to the orphanage.
52910,Ned Flanders,no.
54263,Ned Flanders,"that's right. and like any man, i put on my secret christian underpants one leg at a time."
54313,Ned Flanders,isn't she pretty?
52668,Ned Flanders,monorail.
53060,Ned Flanders,"you saved me, reverend. you really went above and beyond. thank you!"
52753,Ned Flanders,"relax, homer, i keep tellin' ya, you're my guest."
53151,Ned Flanders,"homer, is that my muffler?"
53814,Ned Flanders,"the bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" but all i got was a bunch of soggy bread."
52712,Ned Flanders,"oop, sorry, bart, that's a neddy no-no. you're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
54053,Ned Flanders,"what a charming single entendre. now look, i know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
52856,Ned Flanders,"let's see. ""replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
53022,Ned Flanders,"mmm, mmm. 'sure are fun to scratch. mmm. satisfying."
52566,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer, be reasonable."
53687,Ned Flanders,that homer just burns my waffles!
52619,Ned Flanders,"hot diggity! how 'bout that, marge? li'l ol' stanley me! ""stella!"" ""stella!"" heh heh."
53678,Ned Flanders,"gee, looks like this town has a good sam log-jam."
53996,Ned Flanders,"homer, you could've killed him!"
53228,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, reverend? it's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'."
53543,Ned Flanders,"oh, those are not the words!"
52553,Ned Flanders,"oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
53236,Ned Flanders,what the dickens?!
54364,Ned Flanders,"joke's on you, i needed a trim!"
53969,Ned Flanders,and this is where sinners spend all of eternity!
52546,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i'm opening a one-stop store for southpaws. everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. i'm gonna call it the leftorium."
52880,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't know if the allegations are true / but you got us, and baby, we got you."
53981,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, shoot! shoot!"
52673,Ned Flanders,ann landers is a boring old biddy.
54473,Ned Flanders,"well, look who's back."
54224,Ned Flanders,"well, i got excited for nothing."
54368,Ned Flanders,"diddily, diddily, diddily, diddily!"
53644,Ned Flanders,and a lot of verses against it.
54223,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe your kids didn't."
53538,Ned Flanders,"hey, hey, now hold on there. the nice people want to hear the real words."
53411,Ned Flanders,will do.
53493,Ned Flanders,"so, did you boys have a good time?"
53927,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've never seen you like this before."
52723,Ned Flanders,"whoa, nelly!"
52612,Ned Flanders,yes?
54167,Ned Flanders,nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to jekyll down this hyde.
53139,Ned Flanders,"rod, get off of there!"
52933,Ned Flanders,"howdy, reverend lovejoy. nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog."
52869,Ned Flanders,"heydilly-ho! welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
54302,Ned Flanders,what the? i've been using that around the boys!
54341,Ned Flanders,less news from the pews!
52731,Ned Flanders,"come back! come back! oh, we're done for! we're done for! we're done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
53363,Ned Flanders,"jesus, is that you?"
54064,Ned Flanders,"well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, i appreciate the sediment."
53158,Ned Flanders,"i suppose, if you must know... i'm... well, i'm... i'm sixty."
52887,Ned Flanders,righty-o!
52657,Ned Flanders,"we'll take good care of your boy, simpson. enjoy the miracle of creation."
53955,Ned Flanders,welcome to heck house! you're about to discover what a life of sin will get you!
53522,Ned Flanders,i'll say. i'd really like to go out and get the mail.
52984,Ned Flanders,"lookin' good, rod. lookin' good."
53632,Ned Flanders,sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. the last thing i bought for a lady was a casket.
54235,Ned Flanders,"bart simpson? why, he lives right next door to me! yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."
53262,Ned Flanders,ho-ho! what a great pot party.
52897,Ned Flanders,today we write a new page in the flanders family bible.
54309,Ned Flanders,"oh no, ""games"" stands for gathering of american messengers for evangelical sports!"
59908,Marge,"oh, please. you get exhausted watching ""the twilight zone"" marathon! i'm a regular billy crystal."
64775,Marge,"oh roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
57510,Marge,woo-woo!
57335,Marge,ow! i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet i never even heard of.
66881,Marge,"okay... there's a song about, um... how democrats and republicans can't get along. it's called ""cats and dogs."""
61219,Marge,"bart, run like the wind!"
55410,Marge,"maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime..."
60258,Marge,"and don't worry, honey, i'll pray double hard for both of us. now let's get you some christmas cookies."
55953,Marge,this is dangerous. i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie.
62182,Marge,"homer! homer, where are you?"
57371,Marge,"oh, homie, are you okay?"
57756,Marge,"wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
56004,Marge,"oh, i don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. i mean these are professional lawmen and..."
67132,Marge,you never intended for me to use that ball.
63198,Marge,there was a happy young family...
67183,Marge,"oh! oh! well, all right."
64727,Marge,"oh, i didn't realize..."
65185,Marge,"oh this, it's just a little zelzel minchet aletcha wat. it's all i ever eat here."
65179,Marge,"oh, i'll just have a side salad..."
60998,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, ned."
66729,Marge,i can't take it. all homer does is play that stupid bass! doink doink doink doink doink doink doink!
58129,Marge,looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas.
62146,Marge,you don't belong on the lawn. you belong in your bed with your wife!
57748,Marge,"what's the matter, bart? weren't you happy with him?"
63182,Marge,"homer, this is wonderful. where are the kids?"
66837,Marge,how can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
65243,Marge,luann?
61391,Marge,"marge simpson, long-time reader, first-time stander-upper... did you have any special training to become a writer?"
57984,Marge,so we need a place to spend the night.
58966,Marge,"god, you have every right to flick me out too. but before you..."
59850,Marge,"i just saw you! get him outta here, chief!"
55877,Marge,oh my goodness.
59870,Marge,"ooh. maggie, are your ears burning?"
67366,Marge,what's wrong?
61680,Marge,"i don't know... homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?"
67037,Marge,"i'm sorry, everybody. but i've only got two cupcakes for the three of you."
55836,Marge,i know.
55376,Marge,"homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
58416,Marge,"ohhh, look, homie. our wedding cake."
55195,Marge,"homer! bart, you did a very cruel thing."
56298,Marge,wake up!
56482,Marge,"at any rate, i believe you and i think you should go outside and straighten this out. some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
55664,Marge,"homer, i prepared a special surprise just for you."
65272,Marge,merry christmas eve! where are the kids?
58588,Marge,"i tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques."
60409,Marge,where are you taking me?
64591,Marge,i don't see any chewing!
64026,Marge,"homie, please, nothing good will come of this."
63541,Marge,"well, promises mean more to me."
62424,Marge,maggie!
56647,Marge,no. i said coffee.
64950,Marge,she doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair.
67040,Marge,"no, bart. this note isn't about you."
54616,Marge,"oh, evolve yourself, professor jerk -- or should i say, associate professor jerk!"
61939,Marge,nothing's more powerful than a mother's love.
59720,Marge,"oh, well, that's good... oh."
65711,Marge,"calm down, everyone. calm down. i'm sure they'll have us out of here soon."
67623,Marge,"well, i don't know how intense it was..."
58511,Marge,i'd buy one.
55460,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, i had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
60202,Marge,"oh, homey, you poor thing."
66195,Marge,i'm a little tired. could we just snuggle again?
64746,Marge,"lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever."
59887,Marge,it's for charity -- it benefits victims of balcony collapse.
67204,Marge,is thursday okay?
55643,Marge,let's keep looking.
57423,Marge,"no, i had to go rent the bulldozer."
55412,Marge,that sounds awfully harsh.
56828,Marge,i just want to relax and forget that i'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
65111,Marge,"well, there's ned out on his power walk. maybe you should talk to him."
60796,Marge,ooh... please be a melon-baller. please be a melon-baller.
54847,Marge,"oooh, look, homer. the irs."
58141,Marge,what's wrong?
60497,Marge,"well, it's easier to chew than that bambi video."
64015,Marge,no!
67215,Marge,didn't he used to be your assistant?
65897,Marge,lousy.
64749,Marge,mama bear said 'i'm sure sister bear will come to her senses.'
56933,Marge,"i miss the way bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
57900,Marge,michael jackson still was black...
57626,Marge,no.
60618,Marge,what does he want now?
61788,Marge,but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
55352,Marge,i don't know if that tape is working. you ate three desserts tonight.
54984,Marge,don't you at least have something to say to bart?
56281,Marge,"i don't know, honey. i guess that's the school's decision to make."
56666,Marge,"bart, i told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
62858,Marge,i know what the sun is.
62647,Marge,uhh... yeah!
55927,Marge,"homer! you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
54602,Marge,uhhh... not exactly.
56405,Marge,i don't approve of that.
60075,Marge,"oh well, this is our stop."
60053,Marge,"you shoo, barney gumbel!"
62304,Marge,what language is this? gibby-gabby?
67220,Marge,your father. he's having a boys' night out.
67655,Marge,can i just make one suggestion? can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?
55768,Marge,hello.
55525,Marge,"please, homer. why do i always have to be the bad guy?"
58251,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
63982,Marge,uh-huh...
60188,Marge,person-to-person?!
57336,Marge,you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
54769,Marge,"oh yeah, sure."
59582,Marge,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but i think my family likes becky more than me."
56750,Marge,"look at branford ii! isn't that cute? he thinks he's one of the models, inc."
67012,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
59115,Marge,"homer, what are you doing here?"
64214,Marge,please just stay there till bart graduates high school.
65733,Marge,i'm afraid not.
56707,Marge,all right. it's time to vote for the grand prize.
61717,Marge,but then your father showed his true colors.
59151,Marge,"oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero."
60447,Marge,"aw, homie, you'll always be my western hero."
55881,Marge,so how are things at home?
62499,Marge,awww. i'll be right down.
67274,Marge,"hello, homer. what's that?"
59303,Marge,"oh, homie."
60678,Marge,aren't you a dear.
59873,Marge,all of that is you. you've gotta take this more seriously.
57486,Marge,now i remember why i put
59780,Marge,"sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere."
57539,Marge,you're not listening. you're only hearing what you want to hear.
67709,Marge,consonants.
61105,Marge,the amish are so industrious. not like those shiftless mennonites.
62707,Marge,"well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the s.a.t.: ""snuggles and tickles."""
57979,Marge,bart!
65416,Marge,no! irish and long island!
59130,Marge,it's not dope! it's something to help you concentrate.
60220,Marge,who wants some astro-lemonade?
67444,Marge,now stop it you two. and don't look too down. i'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
56930,Marge,...and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
67478,Marge,"i don't think that it's broken, honey. here, let me try."
66494,Marge,"oh, moe. are we doing this again?"
58201,Marge,that was fun. i wish we had a glass bottom car. i can't help but wonder what we're missing.
65919,Marge,"really? jeez, they make everything."
61305,Marge,my husband's a power-mad star.
67524,Marge,"oh now, homer, they're nothing special. the extra ingredient is care."
64743,Marge,"you know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them."
67071,Marge,"homer, i'm telling you this is not the interstate."
61027,Marge,this is so romantic.
56346,Marge,"oh, wait, wait, that's no good. i know, your grandfather."
54625,Marge,okay.
65648,Marge,put that down! we're being audited!
64327,Marge,tap out! don't make me break your arm!
65484,Marge,why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?
56007,Marge,"ruth, i've done a lot of thinking, and i really consider you a friend. and an important part of friendship is..."
62853,Marge,"i may have lost my memory, but i'm not an idiot."
64689,Marge,that's nice. what kind of favor?
65734,Marge,and this goes too.
55060,Marge,"""you will not see me again until i am a man."" oh, homer, homer."
64433,Marge,he does all the time. you just never listen.
67253,Marge,"bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in france?"
58607,Marge,"a cell phone? last thursday's ""variety""?"
63386,Marge,he needs something with your father's scent.
55547,Marge,i could get a job.
57211,Marge,i wish i'd pay more attention.
61464,Marge,"you know, i think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
62501,Marge,"well, i heard neil young sing about her..."
61782,Marge,"bart, where did you get those?"
57386,Marge,"yay, mom! all right, mom!"
57581,Marge,"oh my god, what happened to your fingers?!"
66853,Marge,yes.
57179,Marge,miss... miss! do you have a chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
58435,Marge,hope that farmhouse has a phone.
65581,Marge,"homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say?"
63006,Marge,you are not bringing that thing home.
64533,Marge,never mind what he said. you just listen to me.
66298,Marge,i never wanted to say funny vows!
55537,Marge,"look, you have to help discipline your son."
61724,Marge,"no, homer."
57415,Marge,you're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the english language are marge simpson!
55513,Marge,homer!
59845,Marge,"i believe you, jack. now let's get you out of here... wait for my signal."
63088,Marge,i made it myself.
60469,Marge,grampa's here to get his driver's license.
65928,Marge,it sure has taken a beating over the years. might be time to get a new one...
64754,Marge,mike scioscia! didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant?
66546,Marge,pizza. mmmm.
64362,Marge,how 'bout history?
62324,Marge,"homer, you've been out all night! and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. were you at that catholic church?!"
59527,Marge,"come on, bart. while your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip."
57457,Marge,"actually, luann, i don't really know anything about yo--"
57737,Marge,"oh, bart, you didn't have to do that. oh!"
65995,Marge,what are you doing?!
56247,Marge,what the darn...?
55158,Marge,"goodbye, homie."
55159,Marge,check the dryer!
67498,Marge,children need discipline. you can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
57890,Marge,and have ten items or less.
60065,Marge,"hey, what are you doing?"
58257,Marge,"homer, bill gates is here."
55782,Marge,i don't know if i like you experimenting on your brother.
65421,Marge,mr. burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived.
58301,Marge,you poor little boy.
57149,Marge,"yeah. hi, evelyn."
62772,Marge,"well, it's a cinch springfield won't be that lucky city."
65048,Marge,"c'mon, people. peaches!"
59177,Marge,no more murders.
58557,Marge,no kickboxing!
56122,Marge,"lisa -- ordinarily, i'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
58339,Marge,"oh, let your brother do sports."
56532,Marge,sock puppets.
60235,Marge,"her?! she's just kidding, mr. lord."
61518,Marge,"oh, your nightlight's burned out. and the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
60586,Marge,what would that accomplish?
61523,Marge,no we didn't.
58027,Marge,i'm just so honored to have you here in our home.
61857,Marge,"i'll be right here at three to pick you up, then i'll take you to the zoo! we can eat fries out of a safari hat!"
66690,Marge,"oh, don't mention her eye. don't mention her eye."
55172,Marge,and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
62542,Marge,sweet home alabama / where the skies are so blue
57363,Marge,but you'll get killed!
67721,Marge,i also said i hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
61220,Marge,"well, i've only read it in books."
55395,Marge,"homer, my audition is in half..."
65524,Marge,"homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!"
57037,Marge,"well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
55234,Marge,"homer, we're on a tight budget here. promise me you won't get carried away."
56837,Marge,"and that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
58615,Marge,you lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
58800,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad we were able to get together."
60951,Marge,"of course, the stock market's been down lately."
58158,Marge,"we got the popcorn! did you get ""waiting to exhale?"""
63676,Marge,don't you remember what today is?
67811,Marge,"well, lisa, here it is; the bouvier family quilt."
55415,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face...
65812,Marge,"we can do without tv for a day! we're taking maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two."
66653,Marge,"really? but the franchise agreement says mother hubbard inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. clause twenty-seven c-3."
59379,Marge,"homer, who are you calling?"
58254,Marge,is that my good butter?
65634,Marge,lisa!
66423,Marge,kirk and luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
54689,Marge,"no, it can't be! i would never hurt marge! i'm a good man!"
57480,Marge,"ooh, a rubik's cube. let's all work it together."
66006,Marge,gulp?! was that a gulp? are you getting a sore throat? let me give you some castor oil.
66733,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this band has brought out the best in you."
59590,Marge,"oh, no. the ""brakes cut"" light."
65708,Marge,where do they go?
62013,Marge,you'd better stop
62323,Marge,"let's just change the subject. bart, would you like to say grace?"
56052,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
66678,Marge,what happened?
58903,Marge,oh my god!
67199,Marge,please.
65046,Marge,"actually, we pay them for each peach we take home."
56527,Marge,i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
67732,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
63769,Marge,she needs to see you right away!
66584,Marge,"oh, thank god."
63217,Marge,"homer, is that you?!"
59078,Marge,"honey, i know you want to see japan, but we're down to our last million yen."
60864,Marge,"okay marge, you can do this. you've done it a thousand times before."
64258,Marge,"""in last night's 'macbeth,' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan, followed by duffman as macduff, lenny leonard as lennox, eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, homer simpson."""
63555,Marge,dwight?! i was just on my way to see you in prison.
61877,Marge,"lisa, just take a bite. one bite -- that's all i ask!"
55602,Marge,"bart, it's your bedtime. i laid out your jammy-jams."
55556,Marge,"oh, i see."
56106,Marge,it certainly is exotic.
62413,Marge,"well, i hope he's accompanied by the ""how was your day"" monster, and the ""foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
57757,Marge,"yeah, he's broke!"
66864,Marge,he's not my lover!
64394,Marge,you could wash this iceberg lettuce.
66942,Marge,"take it, homer!"
64616,Marge,"homie, can i talk to you for a second?"
65565,Marge,this says you are the manager.
55432,Marge,"i'm sure you won't enjoy it. there's nothing about bowling in the play... oh wait, there is."
61652,Marge,"homie, look at them!"
60604,Marge,"look lisa, there's an opening."
62360,Marge,can he swim?
62565,Marge,johnson's water seal.
63315,Marge,i think i'll go to bed.
64410,Marge,that runs on electricity also.
62856,Marge,who are those freaks?
62085,Marge,he's done good things for you too.
64962,Marge,the a.a.? no!
58185,Marge,"well, well, well..."
61238,Marge,thanks for the meatloaf recipe. i claim it as my own.
61232,Marge,homer!
56875,Marge,"homer, come quick! bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
60927,Marge,"homer, god isn't some kind of holy concierge. you can't keep bugging him for every little thing."
60229,Marge,do a nice one for grandma.
60357,Marge,"please, homie? no more craziness -- for me?"
66599,Marge,but that's so many sandwiches!
66399,Marge,are you wearing sock garters?
66296,Marge,it was me! i was the one who told the fbi.
67670,Marge,you're alive!
66552,Marge,lisa's door's unlocked!
56135,Marge,who wants ginger snaps?
59775,Marge,are you crazy?! i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
60558,Marge,"homie, you don't need drugs anymore. your eyes are all better."
67382,Marge,what's going on out here? homer! bart! lisa! maggie! stop it!
57865,Marge,it's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the williamsburg bridge! fourth avenue! governor's island!
57689,Marge,for life!
55704,Marge,"well, bye."
60394,Marge,for you. for you.
62896,Marge,mr. simpson?
59290,Marge,"well, good. i guess."
63602,Marge,"so you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!"
63218,Marge,"lisa, it was wonderful! i am such a proud hitachee mother."
58579,Marge,oh my god!
60895,Marge,grampa! i'm not afraid!
63493,Marge,"goodnight, teddy bear. goodnight, justin timberwolf. goodnight, bedtime krusty."
67402,Marge,"children, bedtime."
62662,Marge,"uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. i like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
67543,Marge,... and the horse i rode in on!?
58401,Marge,that's the kind of faucet i want for your bathroom.
62069,Marge,i don't think it's exactly what mom would want.
67141,Marge,never you mind.
63292,Marge,"that internet has it all. today i found i had the same birthday as randy quaid, i mapquested a great new route to the armory, and i got a list of local houses where i'm not letting you kids trick or treat anymore!"
59209,Marge,maybe it needs more fertilizer.
64255,Marge,he's the one getting the good reviews! which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
61971,Marge,"until you pay us back, you're answering to me! and there's gonna be big changes."
65213,Marge,who am i kidding? i'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. i'm calling homer.
63717,Marge,"now that's enough, you each got one in."
65794,Marge,you should know that me saying i don't care means i couldn't care more.
65224,Marge,"i know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me."
66979,Marge,you don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
67861,Marge,apu! what are you doing here?
55820,Marge,"grampa, please. he's in a coma."
58307,Marge,"all right, all right, now. you're over-stimulated. let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed."
58035,Marge,i don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
63525,Marge,homer! lisa is receiving the student of the millennium award at school.
64449,Marge,potato... tomato... let's call the whole thing--
60149,Marge,let's get out of here.
65137,Marge,"that's great, homie! come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
65610,Marge,"you know, i always send the theater manager a check the next day."
64506,Marge,"oh stop -- it's the journal of a sweet little girl! keep reading, honey."
62779,Marge,where is the baby?
58148,Marge,unless...
59837,Marge,"just till you make it. remember, i believe in you."
65307,Marge,i was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. better sort those out.
66772,Marge,aww.
66288,Marge,now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
60183,Marge,"ooo, burly, you're insatiable."
67213,Marge,"homer, is this some kind of stag party?"
59730,Marge,mmm.
58174,Marge,hmf. why don't you want to go out there?
63556,Marge,"okay... they're so buggy, i can't!"
64050,Marge,your majesty... did you remember to invite ned flanders?
61202,Marge,"oh, a rattle!"
62311,Marge,"c'mon. you tell him right now. ned, homer has something to tell you."
56190,Marge,"homer, that's hans moleman."
62357,Marge,i don't know.
64530,Marge,thanks for doing the dishes.
58715,Marge,what the dilly-yo?
66992,Marge,"well, i'm not much of a drinker..."
67750,Marge,"well, then maybe you should pay for it."
56290,Marge,"while you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in monday."
64808,Marge,i remember everything.
63864,Marge,okay. milhouse?
54778,Marge,"for months, i worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
59654,Marge,"but husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?"
66168,Marge,"chief, what are you doing to save our son?"
58597,Marge,"well, it looks like the lake is the place to be, huh?"
61620,Marge,"well, it's... in my case... hmm."
62470,Marge,okay.
61607,Marge,i'm gonna sleep on the couch.
59624,Marge,we were using fifty-dollar bills as toilet paper. and toilet paper as dog toilet paper.
66753,Marge,"oh, my poor homie! this is what i was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! thank you, moe."
62530,Marge,aren't they jazzy? they match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!
67760,Marge,one. and two. and three. and reach. and five. and six. and seven..
67193,Marge,hmm-hmm.
63993,Marge,...so lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! she's finally doing something the book said she would!
63109,Marge,it's in that dumpster.
54687,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
60756,Marge,yes!
59421,Marge,"now if there's anything, anything at all i can do to help out..."
54780,Marge,so maybe a part-time job is the answer.
62561,Marge,"homer, please! we're about to have tea!"
56551,Marge,"ready for breakfast, doctor smith?"
63388,Marge,"i love santa's little helper, but i don't know if we can have him in our home anymore."
55872,Marge,"knock, knock."
56230,Marge,what about abe simpson? don't you have any feelings for him?
61595,Marge,i hope he didn't have children. did he have children?
61663,Marge,yup. it's really boring. you kids would have hated it.
55205,Marge,and the next man wants to hit the ball too. and he does. and there he goes off in that direction. and everyone is happy.
63214,Marge,hm...
62688,Marge,"oh, that's the new ""femac"" ! the computer designed just for women! the ""you've got mail"" voice is susan sarandon!"
64160,Marge,maggie.
62487,Marge,"i'm so glad we came to paradise pier. ever since i was a little girl, i've wanted to ride that ferris wheel!"
66497,Marge,"how are you, milhouse?"
67875,Marge,"well, maybe not, but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
60724,Marge,"kids, look what i got you for your third grade field trip -- matching fanny packs!"
56637,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake, bart! use the plunger!"
67616,Marge,"what do you think, homer?"
66847,Marge,dare i say it? yippee!
57435,Marge,i know it's not! i'm going into the dining room to have a conversation. anyone who wants to join me is welcome.
54811,Marge,"homer, you encouraged him. you should be strangling yourself."
67927,Marge,that's where you're wrong! get out on that stage!
65052,Marge,"so, that's why lisa excused herself a few minutes ago."
56916,Marge,don't do that!
59312,Marge,"no, they're not. they're terrible, terrible ideas."
63362,Marge,"homer, i think you dominoed this."
58972,Marge,"you know, homie, a lot of men use their saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
58020,Marge,"don't be shy. uh, excuse me! excuse me, we have one more bachelor!"
56277,Marge,does that earring mean you're a pirate?
66944,Marge,"all right... hmmm... how about ""he""?"
65314,Marge,rag soup!
61380,Marge,when bad things happen to cute children says that a new pet will pull you out of your sorrow cycle.
56664,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
64691,Marge,"well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so i thought you deserved a reward."
62668,Marge,i'd like to get into some blue pants right now.
64052,Marge,i think we should go see our mortgage broker.
57546,Marge,i'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. they sound a little risky.
56376,Marge,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's little helper. do you want me to write any of this down?"
64961,Marge,what kind of card?
59826,Marge,i hope this is okay. it's not very prison-y.
57245,Marge,"""parent's occupation... please note: homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. that's why you don't get paid for it."""
55511,Marge,that's the way we do it every year.
58639,Marge,lisa?
61908,Marge,"gee, with all that travel, you probably haven't had much time to find that special someone."
67844,Marge,hello.
59417,Marge,it's hard to believe we're never going to see maude again.
61937,Marge,"i'll save you, lisa! whoa."
55464,Marge,"i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, i'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
65356,Marge,thank you.
59661,Marge,"the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939."
54804,Marge,we got exactly what we wanted out of this: we gave an old man a second chance.
56764,Marge,"honey, maybe you should relax a little?"
66084,Marge,why are you singing that?
64984,Marge,homer!
59704,Marge,"you are not pretending to be dead, young lady. this family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
61679,Marge,we understand perfectly well!
63504,Marge,"did you hear that, maggie-wags? you're a queen!"
55391,Marge,"i'm auditioning for a play! it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named desire."" isn't that exciting?"
63941,Marge,"alberto, i'm not sure if this is such a good idea."
59392,Marge,"ooh, the drain bugger!"
56413,Marge,"homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
62733,Marge,i'll do it!
59935,Marge,he's not moving.
64905,Marge,you can't buy white wine!
60821,Marge,"oooh, that place is famous. it's where j. lo hit p-diddy upside the head with gary coleman."
55824,Marge,uh-huh.
63311,Marge,my son is an evil knight! the most successful evil knight in all the earthland realms! not bad.
61378,Marge,i said no!
63489,Marge,chief wiggums! the maestro is the killer!
55683,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
66558,Marge,that's a prison road crew.
59896,Marge,it's totally unfair for one side to have a professional player.
54600,Marge,and did you also know that history is written by the winners?
65993,Marge,"okay, let's try again."
61730,Marge,but now it can have a second meaning.
64336,Marge,"now lisa, you're a vegetarian, but these cows have made a different choice."
61817,Marge,fish scales?
59859,Marge,"you know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. i hear mel brooks has one. i mean, sir mel brooks."
59137,Marge,i was thinking of something a little more... adult.
60275,Marge,"you know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
60307,Marge,i'll play it later.
64338,Marge,i can't shoot her. she's lisa's godmother.
67878,Marge,"what were you like as a boy, mr. burns? did you have a dog that you loved."
60837,Marge,today's tuesday and you've had six beers.
64049,Marge,homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. i'm afraid it's growing out of hand.
57762,Marge,oh my goodness. kids! homer! we're late for church! i'm glad i dressed last night.
56292,Marge,"homer, homer!"
66495,Marge,let me just say this once: i'm good.
66118,Marge,eat up.
62730,Marge,"what are you doing, homer?"
56164,Marge,"homer, it looks like it could gore."
60054,Marge,"that's not my uncle lou, and this man's not dead."
58282,Marge,"mm, if you'd just apologize to louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want."
55402,Marge,love...
63236,Marge,homer! don't kill the foreign man!
61084,Marge,i am so sick of that song!
63140,Marge,i guess you can stay a little longer.
56677,Marge,"not too good, lisa. frankly, he's underneath the table."
67299,Marge,leave homer?
59094,Marge,perfect.
62774,Marge,"homie, you've been down here for a week, i really think you need- what the hellmann's real mayonnaise?!"
56260,Marge,"here's your water, moe."
66725,Marge,what the?
64032,Marge,"well, that's what's missing. our lives would be horrible without the kids."
58015,Marge,he's doing what he thinks is best...
65332,Marge,"well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. now start quilting!"
57655,Marge,"oh, homer, look! look! a tv guide owned by jackie o.!"
56781,Marge,you just don't want to take that test.
66203,Marge,you can have one of these!
57992,Marge,what about the gun?
55203,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
57055,Marge,"lawyers... lawyers. ooh, lionel hutz. ""cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
63935,Marge,"there's absolutely nothing to worry about! i'm in my own room, being chaperoned by an actual christian."
58592,Marge,i am so -ing embarrassed.
61141,Marge,i don't know what happened. i saw you and i went for the brake but i hit the accelerator!
66578,Marge,maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
65809,Marge,"and now that i know better, no dvds for you kids. just educational television."
67447,Marge,what exactly did he say?
61372,Marge,i probably should have watched it first.
60780,Marge,"can't beat a skybox. all the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box."
55381,Marge,"good-bye my special little guy. lisa, watch out for poison ivy. remember, ""leaves of 3, let it be."
64268,Marge,"that's it, three stories. that's what we always tell."
63651,Marge,keith olbermann?!
59033,Marge,where'd you get that champagne?
57740,Marge,"oh, he's so smart!"
54611,Marge,who gets... cutie-puss?
59996,Marge,even on the soles of her shoes.
55609,Marge,i can't believe you bought that plow. we can't afford it.
59351,Marge,"oh, thank god you're all right!"
56100,Marge,"bart, it's time to get ready for the show."
56746,Marge,"oh, my god! she's having babies! oh, i'm sorry, girl. i thought you were just getting fat."
67471,Marge,"honey, please. you're in the way."
57458,Marge,"homer, get ready!"
63381,Marge,"no, no, i didn't mean--"
64813,Marge,would it be so bad to turn out like me?
65198,Marge,but this was all i had!
63291,Marge,just put on a towel!
59380,Marge,"well, don't run up mr. burns' phone bill."
62056,Marge,but veronica's a girl's name. did you know that?
61242,Marge,bet... system... betting system! god is telling me to gamble!
66621,Marge,i'm sorry i woke you up. i'm just so anxious about tomorrow. what if the store fails? what if i fail?
61737,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
61282,Marge,"homer, are you spooning that snack?"
64043,Marge,homie! what are you doing home so early?
67411,Marge,absolutely not!
55837,Marge,"oh my god, it's my old boyfriend, artie ziff."
67034,Marge,are you boys through playing war?
61271,Marge,"turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
62339,Marge,"hello, homer."
55866,Marge,you did?
62747,Marge,"well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
63806,Marge,"thank you, dear."
65172,Marge,everything's fine... we'll just wait here for the tow truck.
61925,Marge,i'm so sick of names!
55502,Marge,"oh, homer."
54860,Marge,"hi, ned. homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of."
55895,Marge,"... some ice cream at the store, since i'm saving so much money on diet cola."
62815,Marge,i'm just trying to take the pressure off of you.
58587,Marge,"i absolutely refuse to go along with this. but since i have no choice, i'll take the alley."
61051,Marge,"james taylor. homie, remember that song we used to sing?"
64660,Marge,bart?!
59011,Marge,are you talking to me or the beer?
67766,Marge,"homer? do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the bowler's hall of fame in st. louis, missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?"
67054,Marge,"lisa, you'll be late for band practice. let's go."
64339,Marge,that was so noble of apu to give his life for us.
55162,Marge,uh-huh.
55005,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
67258,Marge,'bye. we miss you.
55250,Marge,... will now be chub night.
62910,Marge,"well, i'm so glad there's a show we women can enjoy!"
57838,Marge,or save the endangered alaskan salmon?
65190,Marge,"uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans saturday night."
54820,Marge,"bart, watch maggie while i get the laundry."
58598,Marge,"homer, your spine!"
64845,Marge,"homer, are you scaring those kids?"
57147,Marge,what about the symphony -- or the theater?
59669,Marge,they were looking at me. with their eyes.
63348,Marge,you really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
55213,Marge,"oh, dear."
57219,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
56513,Marge,the arabian nights room looks nice...
58628,Marge,"no, no one's ""going catholic."" three children is enough, thank you."
61641,Marge,"well, i-i... let's just rent a movie."
57101,Marge,"there's no place left to run, bart. hand it over."
57931,Marge,"and so, just as things looked their worst..."
56330,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
64159,Marge,your daughter barely knows who you are!
66908,Marge,"""dear friends of the simpson family: we had some sadness and some gladness this year. first the sadness. our little cat, snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. but we bought a new little cat, snowball ii...so i guess life goes on. speaking of life going on, grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. maggie is walking by herself. lisa got straight a's, and bart, well... we love bart. the magic of the season has touched us all..."""
57721,Marge,"you're the one the papers have been talking about. that mysterious ""beer baron"" who's been supplying springfield with alcohol! how have you been getting away with this?"
56698,Marge,how droll.
57836,Marge,christian love?
55296,Marge,you're not even listening to me!
57476,Marge,but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. it's nothing but panhandling!
62242,Marge,you didn't validate my parking.
63356,Marge,"maggie, i'm sorry you miss your pacifier. but when a mother makes a decision, she has to stick by it."
56227,Marge,mom's almost ready for her date. she sure seems taken by this new beau. i feel so bad for grampa.
64020,Marge,"you got a letter all the way from new york city, and that's something!"
55140,Marge,"alright, don't whine. just put it in my left hand."
62003,Marge,i'm afraid so.
58670,Marge,"oh, that's cute. did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
67451,Marge,"homer, i'm your best friend, but i've gotta say, i've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor."
66522,Marge,we're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.
67208,Marge,so how was the office birthday party?
57212,Marge,"you know, homer, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
57028,Marge,sweet dreams.
57021,Marge,let's find out.
55214,Marge,"ohh, well, i guess he'll be happy when he comes to."
62298,Marge,the worst part is i'll never see my homie again!
66514,Marge,ooh! game night?
66884,Marge,actually... my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church.
64082,Marge,"ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! who's a chubby baby?"
66320,Marge,"i don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
67323,Marge,don't muss my hair.
62008,Marge,it's true. you'd be quite a catch... if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath.
64641,Marge,homer?
63426,Marge,sorry-sorry-sorry!
60708,Marge,a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
63403,Marge,pink frosting fixes everything!
57004,Marge,i'm going out. i run errands during the day.
67437,Marge,fourth street and d!
56297,Marge,"this romance is so full of heartfelt passion. i can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. homer. are you awake? this is important, give me some sign you're awake."
58706,Marge,now it's marge's time to shine!
65994,Marge,lesson over.
66875,Marge,even i saw that. i guess i can't tell homer.
62912,Marge,"go ahead, maggie. you're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."
63498,Marge,"oh, i don't want to bother the internet with my problem."
64728,Marge,i'll take it!
65043,Marge,"we'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes, and watch the four saddest horse movies i could find."
65047,Marge,"okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s?"
57608,Marge,does anyone else want anything while i'm up?
57209,Marge,"lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in springfield or stenchburg. you know why they chose springfield? because everyone knows jebediah springfield was a true american hero. end of story."
60908,Marge,"hurry up kids, you'll miss the bus!"
60643,Marge,i'll always love you.
58658,Marge,who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
67261,Marge,"well, i guess for the next few months, yes, i'll be your mother."
63791,Marge,"sweetie, don't you think your mom might have a trick up her sleeve?"
63720,Marge,this is my husband...
63878,Marge,what are you doing at this construction site?!
65178,Marge,back to the car.
62844,Marge,"maple syrup, mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff! this is going to take my whole arsenal at once!"
63019,Marge,i could start my own carpentry business. i'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind.
59040,Marge,run!
61211,Marge,you guys are the world's worst cops.
65011,Marge,"ooh, a pen from the milwaukee hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s!"
65726,Marge,how can you call yourself a christian?
64637,Marge,why do i waste my breath?
62876,Marge,"i've had a lovely evening, mr. simpson."
59697,Marge,"yeah, that was the boy lisa likes."
61348,Marge,"ms. naegle, i'm sorry to surprise you like this, but i thought if we met face-to-face, we could settle our differences."
57146,Marge,"really? you like it? oh, i'd love to wear this someplace special."
61525,Marge,artie ziff! why are you living in our attic?
61929,Marge,let me think about it. no.
57554,Marge,"oh, i don't want to own my own business. i don't know why i came here in the first place."
64589,Marge,yes! enjoy!
57196,Marge,"what are you going to spend your money on, kids?"
61664,Marge,"oh, you know, typical boring dayton weather!"
67922,Marge,"um... mr. demon, could you come back for my sisters later?"
66028,Marge,dammit!
62611,Marge,really?
66360,Marge,i don't know bart. this is one of those... arkham asylum-type hospitals.
67547,Marge,"it stands for ""springfieldians"
66515,Marge,that sounds like fun. i'll just tell homer and--
64996,Marge,what are you guys doing up there?
62509,Marge,no.
61559,Marge,do you have to make such an unholy racket?
62877,Marge,know what?
63156,Marge,gil?!
61781,Marge,"cut me some slack, i'm a widow."
65996,Marge,stop making putin jokes!
58200,Marge,i wonder how that happened?
67077,Marge,"oh, i don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, lisa."
57421,Marge,i rest my case.
61285,Marge,but seeing you like this is more than i can bear.
58139,Marge,"well, at least the burglar's having a merry christmas."
61888,Marge,no! i want to hear what happened at the store!
65055,Marge,no!
67807,Marge,"mm hm. two o'clock is fine. thank you, dr. hibbert."
56827,Marge,"look, why don't you two settle down. i'm sure you can get another pillow."
61290,Marge,"lisa, i think your father just left!"
54879,Marge,"well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
64182,Marge,it is a sauna in here. must've been put in by a previous owner. this house is full of surprises. but this is the first good one.
65490,Marge,homer!
63881,Marge,look at bart go! he must be running away!
63326,Marge,"good morning, sweetie."
61815,Marge,"well... stuart, i'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog, but it isn't."
60686,Marge,one handsome hubby is all i need.
55420,Marge,"stanley stop, or i'll tell stella."
60930,Marge,how bad is it?
67185,Marge,"here you go, kids. special lunches. lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun."
62800,Marge,constance prudence chastity goodfaith.
63566,Marge,"dwight, that was the most unselfish thing i've ever seen. i'm sorry i didn't visit you before."
60891,Marge,i got all the way out to the tree before i realized i'd left the house.
60400,Marge,"artie, that's a sick idea. come on, homer, we're leaving."
57206,Marge,ye olde toast.
60189,Marge,how did you get my number?
62299,Marge,the warren harding through-hole never seemed so long.
65195,Marge,of course.
61757,Marge,"oh, i've always wanted to go to france. your women don't age -- like catherine deneuve."
66359,Marge,"well, i hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. i don't care for how it circles the cat."
62979,Marge,"homer, our house is on fire! help me save the children!"
67085,Marge,is this going to be on tv?
62541,Marge,"your job isn't to worry about me, it's to give me things to worry about."
59868,Marge,i thought you had your own court.
56236,Marge,that's because you were drunk!
56783,Marge,how's my special little guy?
56900,Marge,"besides, she didn't mean it. it was an accident."
63538,Marge,i just want to go home.
60426,Marge,"but, homer..."
63740,Marge,"i think you've got a point! homie, i'm gonna be a dancer!"
56899,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. if maggie could talk i'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
62850,Marge,wha--?!
57187,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
60765,Marge,"homie, i could use a little more excitement in my life."
67025,Marge,"bart, what happened to you?"
61833,Marge,"hey, plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when i'm auntie whatever it is. right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work. can't you understand that i need this?"
54908,Marge,we're home!
55933,Marge,have you been up all night eating cheese?
56546,Marge,they do so!
62736,Marge,i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it.
65072,Marge,that was a mirror!
58127,Marge,how could somebody...?
57048,Marge,"don't touch those yet. they're very, very hot."
59776,Marge,forget it.
61376,Marge,i need to be alone right now.
60431,Marge,every four years.
59788,Marge,"c'mon, it'll be fun."
66003,Marge,"helen lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot."
66141,Marge,"just rest on the sofa, i'll be home by ten."
61260,Marge,"oh, forget it. bart, don't waste your money on me."
67015,Marge,these are for lisa's class.
66882,Marge,disguises? i'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
64096,Marge,maybe i'm just being selfish. i don't know.
61288,Marge,"now look here, mister. i forbid you to fight a bear."
66206,Marge,"homie? aw, you're shopping ahead for maggie."
54895,Marge,you be good.
66766,Marge,you didn't have to do that. i love you just the same.
67953,Marge,"i need a full-time job to support homer, so he has time to work on his rock music, his erotic etchings, his play-doh theater..."
61342,Marge,"excuse me, everyone. i'm a mother."
67153,Marge,never.
65788,Marge,"kids, your father and i have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians."
67413,Marge,well i think the non-card question is a valid one.
65623,Marge,"homer, she's married to your dad!"
58604,Marge,how's he doing?
62792,Marge,he was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
63657,Marge,eh.
67622,Marge,"well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better. and he mispronounced words that even i know, like abdomen. and his office was dirty. now that i think about it, i'm not sure he's even a doctor."
60147,Marge,get away from that window!
56377,Marge,"what's the matter with you, homer? we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."
58761,Marge,when did you start liking thai food?
57944,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
55289,Marge,"homer, how much did you just give that man?"
65430,Marge,it means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
64911,Marge,"sorry, i'm just not used to everyone behaving."
67484,Marge,"dinner! dinner time, everybody! dinner!"
59085,Marge,"we'll go with ""ow, that hurts,"" skip!"
66819,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie!"
67263,Marge,oh. okay.
59026,Marge,"we're walking, homer."
61810,Marge,"oh my god! someone, somewhere says i'm better than someone else!"
61565,Marge,have you ever walked on stilts? it's not that great.
61429,Marge,oh that's wonderful. and the characters didn't bother you at all?
59064,Marge,eww...
56858,Marge,freeze! every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
65479,Marge,what?! i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time!
56186,Marge,i'm very concerned. mr. burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
59570,Marge,nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before!
65218,Marge,eat deconstructed apple pie!
59555,Marge,no knife games on the kitchen table!
59316,Marge,"to be fair, not all evil robots are killers."
59322,Marge,you guys never use any of this stuff.
58838,Marge,"well, that's a nice feature. not much headroom, though..."
60856,Marge,summary emergency!
60435,Marge,it's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
56777,Marge,"that's a very nice jig, kearney. now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
61146,Marge,oh my god! let me help you up!
64451,Marge,start the joke!
58085,Marge,do you bowl often?
65418,Marge,rum cake!
56448,Marge,we really shouldn't have let them do this. it can't be helping his self esteem.
66850,Marge,"well, i drive all day and i don't get paid a thing. with the money you make, i could buy a fridge with... an icemaker."
67944,Marge,"oh, let's see, should i take the ""trail of death,"" or the ""path of doom?"" maybe i should just go back."
56201,Marge,it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death. those quimby children are so wild and rich. i hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
63203,Marge,homer...
64127,Marge,that's for a child's birthday. we're going to get this one.
61906,Marge,"homer, why do you always have to show that to company?"
63549,Marge,"don't be silly, lisa. in fact --"
54867,Marge,"homer, this is the flanders' entire living room set. how much did you pay for this?"
56145,Marge,"homey, i'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with ned? your family needs you too."
57299,Marge,"it's called little pwagmattasquarmsettport. it's known as ""america's scrod-basket."""
56888,Marge,where is everybody?
66532,Marge,yes.
57413,Marge,get out of my town!
67343,Marge,of course. homer!?
63193,Marge,"i say ""cool waves."""
67886,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
56991,Marge,have you lost your mind?! have you thought about your health?... or your appearance?
56813,Marge,"they didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
64286,Marge,i think you may have put on a little weight.
61997,Marge,"moe, did you see something troubling on the tarmac?"
59244,Marge,"ohhh, homey, is that what's bothering you?"
55175,Marge,maybe we should let the dog in?
60490,Marge,it's never joan van ark.
59571,Marge,"ooo, ooo, i've always wanted to use rosemary in something."
64972,Marge,brambles!
64461,Marge,who's ready for panini?
61913,Marge,"when we published the story, we received the school's highest award."
65158,Marge,"... and here's a marble for lisa for cleaning her room, and a marble for bart for not trashing lisa's room."
63792,Marge,trust me.
65661,Marge,great paper.
62533,Marge,no!
55883,Marge,i didn't expect all this.
66804,Marge,"well, here's what happened..."
66777,Marge,what?!
60070,Marge,townspeople...
65667,Marge,"maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. you know, we might not all be a perfect match."
56264,Marge,"but, how do i know i can trust you?"
60722,Marge,why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert? i made a pie.
57074,Marge,what's the matter with your face? is that a fake nose? are you wearing chin putty?
67808,Marge,"lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. have a nice day at school, bart."
60253,Marge,we'd better call the police.
63560,Marge,okay. but i-i'd feel better about it if you got rid of the gun.
64014,Marge,"a ""castle""... i know where they are!"
57454,Marge,"i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they were so insulting: ""you are a coward."" no one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
57135,Marge,president bush is driving on our lawn! he must be lost.
60320,Marge,hello?
56425,Marge,"oh my, i hope that rug was scotchguarded."
63163,Marge,"i don't care how successful gil is, he's still a mooch, and i need to tell him off!"
56248,Marge,homer!
66964,Marge,"bart, what happened?"
62001,Marge,he's right.
55285,Marge,i want you to stop seeing her.
58738,Marge,right. na--
64083,Marge,but that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
61046,Marge,the first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.
58519,Marge,are you sure? i can usually smell a scam from two towns over.
65760,Marge,"homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. the kids could end up wards of the state."
62018,Marge,"god, that junior league burns me up."
56785,Marge,"lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding gums was a good friend to you. but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them."
60506,Marge,"uh, i think we're with comquaaq."
60677,Marge,"what do you think, homer? does this make my hips look big?"
65713,Marge,see? all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation. betcha the dads are doing the same thing!
59060,Marge,"oh homer, not again."
66582,Marge,i-- i don't really know that much about--
67282,Marge,"ooo, i've got to go, homer. my sisters are here."
62281,Marge,i guess i'll just cut my own hair.
62663,Marge,"homie, what's that?"
56959,Marge,"well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
67628,Marge,...all that time.
55638,Marge,won't that warp him?
66612,Marge,your monkey just ate all my turkey.
66119,Marge,did you pack everything you need?
59949,Marge,i got it!
56954,Marge,this is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house!
57213,Marge,sor-ry. next time get your own darned corn.
62519,Marge,"well, bart, i guess that's it. we'll have to go back to our separate things."
57839,Marge,"well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
56174,Marge,"gosh, i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
61274,Marge,i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
65987,Marge,that's okay. i...
64514,Marge,"ooh, good idea. bart, what are you doing for black history month?"
62951,Marge,or take the same limo.
59357,Marge,i tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
56971,Marge,that giant donut.
57301,Marge,that was thoughtful.
65335,Marge,is it on your father? little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
60114,Marge,"oh, how magical!"
58000,Marge,"he's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
61037,Marge,"well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
67047,Marge,"no, i'm very upset."
56844,Marge,homer!
67717,Marge,"no, artie, artie. the best argument is that i've known and respected you for eight years, and i would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
59356,Marge,does anybody need that much porno?
58874,Marge,get in! get in!
62308,Marge,what are you two doing?
61016,Marge,that's ccr!
59716,Marge,"homer, bring that back in the house."
59104,Marge,will you stop acting so jealous?
56887,Marge,that's odd. where's homer? and bart? and lisa? and grampa?
57469,Marge,what?
59391,Marge,i can't wait to do some shopping -- look at all these innovative products. miracle shears...
56259,Marge,why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
64819,Marge,is it milhouse?
60988,Marge,then all that's left is to protect maggie from the sun.
60884,Marge,i'm sending the cat up with your lunches.
63000,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, bart."
55571,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
61446,Marge,"finally, henry's daughter elizabeth became queen. england's power was never greater, and british actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age."
62125,Marge,no more directory assistance! it's not free!
66167,Marge,it's bart!
66397,Marge,don't call me a gal. makes me feel like i'm your mother.
58417,Marge,"look at this little plastic couple. mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future..."
57244,Marge,"well, there you go."
64672,Marge,"you have to admit, ""bart simpson will die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
59089,Marge,bart!
60241,Marge,she's not a devil. i just don't know what to do.
59333,Marge,owww!!
59049,Marge,"homie? well, look at you..."
55193,Marge,there's maggie!
55729,Marge,oh. are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
58059,Marge,you bought a car?! without consulting me?!
61069,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie. your father won't stay mad forever."
67373,Marge,it just seems too good to be true.
55230,Marge,"we have three kids, homer."
63876,Marge,that's a hard hat zone!
58324,Marge,homer!
56000,Marge,"ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
65572,Marge,"hmm. well, it wouldn't start for me. i think this car's a lemon!"
55653,Marge,i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born.
56826,Marge,um-hmmm. who called the police?
64277,Marge,where every child was free to follow their dream. because nothing is... maggie! get away from there!
58688,Marge,"homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just--"
60855,Marge,"bart, don't say it like that. you'll hurt her feelings-- jeez louise! how did you turn cinnamon applesauce into that?"
65793,Marge,i was the only one without a date at patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
64764,Marge,i'm not really in the mood anymore.
64226,Marge,"you don't need a wii now that i'm here. because you and me make ""us."""
55110,Marge,"now bart, i think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
67684,Marge,the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
55654,Marge,everyone agreed that lisa was a beautiful baby...
62918,Marge,well then i choose... uh...
67693,Marge,"yes, i remember."
63795,Marge,"okay lisa, i'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. huh, i have over four hundred text messages."
60723,Marge,would you like some ice cream with that?
60890,Marge,"ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? a lemon!"
63195,Marge,"homer, no! revenge never solves anything."
60316,Marge,i'm filing a class action lawsuit against big sugar. would you like to give a deposition?
62740,Marge,"well, that's very impressive. does that include the people and the furniture?"
61227,Marge,it's too nice a day to be outside doing chores. come in and watch tv.
60027,Marge,"oh, he's on the blue man group again. c'mon, we've got lotsa time."
57802,Marge,sorry.
63244,Marge,"dr. swanson, i'm bart's mother. i've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery. but i think this is more important. would you please see bart again?"
61626,Marge,i wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
58280,Marge,i'd like to believe you...
55651,Marge,"according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her."
57603,Marge,there they are! let me down here.
64942,Marge,"hey, they're your gutters too."
57499,Marge,"well, don't look at me... just because i'm holding a pair of scissors. scissors which i need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
63052,Marge,"wait, i have an idea! the martians are only killing humans, so we should pretend to be animals!"
57356,Marge,"homer, please, you're hurting my arm!"
56678,Marge,but i like to make you breakfast.
64549,Marge,i'm sorry we ever fought.
62958,Marge,what? no! no! what? no! what?
65880,Marge,objection! unhealthy!
55371,Marge,"well, it's pretty ingrained."
65971,Marge,no husband of mine is wearing a tent!
56943,Marge,"oh, maggie, you're a simpson again!"
59827,Marge,"uh, mecca? well, let's..."
65192,Marge,of what?
55204,Marge,"homer, go back to the garage."
55846,Marge,i think i'll unplug that.
61723,Marge,"no, homer."
58236,Marge,what do you have to say about the leader now? hunh? hunh?
61893,Marge,what's that rumble?
65925,Marge,not gonna say.
56123,Marge,"i had a malibu stacy when i was little, and i turned out all right. now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
60475,Marge,"first he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. your father's out of control."
57427,Marge,don't make up your mind until you hear both songs! morals and ethics and carnal forbearance...
67613,Marge,i didn't know you liked animals.
59457,Marge,don't you think we should wait for lisa? she is the president.
56254,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you, homer? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. i can't trust you anymore."
60225,Marge,fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
61992,Marge,"oh, i'm too tired to talk."
59511,Marge,and y'all hardly ever bicker anymore.
63635,Marge,"homie, you look good!"
55316,Marge,because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
65020,Marge,"ooo, they even have a zoo -- featuring all the nfl mascots!"
60939,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. looks like god has packed up and left springfield."
56533,Marge,sure as sugar.
67229,Marge,"bart, go to your room!"
64626,Marge,should we inform the chief?
60603,Marge,i know a great nametag place. they do fabulous work.
64505,Marge,let's give the olympics a miracle!
59476,Marge,"cheer up, homie. you don't need friends to be happy. i haven't had a friend in years."
57670,Marge,what on earth are you talking about?
56714,Marge,"well, it was a lovely festival. the best movie won and mr. burns found there are some awards that can't be bought."
66440,Marge,you really think we're still doing the right thing?
63097,Marge,yee-hah!
57231,Marge,but?
62927,Marge,"i can't wait to see what evolution will make next: maybe a bird with a people face, or a bear with pants on!"
67162,Marge,"oh, that's very funny."
61450,Marge,they paddled up the mississippi from st. louis...
64946,Marge,my first gray hair!
64951,Marge,i brought home fried chicken...
57060,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. and they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork."
59749,Marge,"uh, sure looks that way... but at least bart and homer are spending quality time together."
62195,Marge,when i was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
62646,Marge,a dollar.
63368,Marge,"next time maggie does that in a pool, tell me quietly, don't announce it."
67335,Marge,oh my goodness.
62709,Marge,i thought they might enjoy it if i took them here.
54624,Marge,"you're right. but i'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, britney spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit."
56568,Marge,"oh well, thank you, doctor, you've changed my life!"
62506,Marge,wanna go inside?
61031,Marge,what's that ruckus?
57854,Marge,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
57290,Marge,"good. i'm glad. and that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
58106,Marge,but it was!
61635,Marge,shame on you two creeps!
62956,Marge,"crossed arms mean ""no."""
63110,Marge,not that one.
59240,Marge,"now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. so we'll just stay here and not disturb him."
66371,Marge,that was a sexual harassment seminar!
57952,Marge,what?!
60844,Marge,what are you doing here?
55002,Marge,what do you mean?
61468,Marge,are these diamondique?
60812,Marge,that's my homie!
58108,Marge,"mmmm. goodbye, ned. if the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, i want you to call me right away. or you can beep me. in fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? we'll go to a hotel."
61419,Marge,"well, what do you think?"
59856,Marge,"umm... i guess i'll, i'll have the chicken tandoori."
65529,Marge,"oh, forget it."
60217,Marge,"sorry, we already solved it."
56471,Marge,he tripped my boy. i demand vengeance! i want vengeance!
59586,Marge,becky's going to seduce homer?
57035,Marge,wait!! wait! my children are in there!
63075,Marge,see.
60542,Marge,go away! go away!
63698,Marge,well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- homie is where my heart is.
63490,Marge,"i'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. no one comes between me and my homie."
64676,Marge,"well, whoever moves in, it can't be worse than having a murderer next door."
60743,Marge,"faced with a problem like this, i wonder, what would oprah do?"
65833,Marge,he's ten years old!
63024,Marge,i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.
66160,Marge,get up / everybody's gonna move their feet
55382,Marge,"you can have the shower to yourself, homie. i'm finished."
58853,Marge,so?
64662,Marge,it's probably a de-boner.
55405,Marge,i play an aging southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law stanley.
57703,Marge,"oh, it's so beautiful! this is what i imagine paris must be like!"
55900,Marge,i don't think this is such a good idea.
62428,Marge,"i hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but maggie is terribly itchy."
65541,Marge,not with the camera on.
59901,Marge,"after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner."
63149,Marge,i'm so sick of gil... he ruins thanksgiving... uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...
57978,Marge,i'm a lucky woman.
57488,Marge,it's dying down!
67368,Marge,"oh, homer, honey. come here."
54945,Marge,what was that? was that a yes or a no?
57338,Marge,what lifelong dream?
56809,Marge,"actually, i'm interested in becoming a police officer."
60660,Marge,"homie, to honor springfield's newest hero, i made you your favorite dinner. all three courses are dessert."
56218,Marge,that's not my mother.
67136,Marge,"i'm keeping it and i'm going to use it. thank you for the present, homer."
64734,Marge,thank god!
56988,Marge,here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
58246,Marge,omigosh! maybe he was telling the truth about everything.
66478,Marge,"homer, could you come with me for a minute?"
58552,Marge,"ohhh, oh, honey. oh, come here."
60453,Marge,you care about bart's feelings.
60356,Marge,he did such crazy things -- roll clip.
62590,Marge,we've passed the ponte vecchio bridge three times. i think we're lost.
56380,Marge,such a violent motif.
63567,Marge,"""you chat up the guard at the gate, while i knife the guard behind me."" i can't do that, dwight."
64422,Marge,bart simpson!
58970,Marge,why aren't we ascending into heaven?
66544,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. i'm fine."
61079,Marge,and i still do.
63228,Marge,"oh, yes sir... as shocks go, this one's a real zaparoo."
60717,Marge,"i'm his groupie! am i saying that right, ""groupie?"""
65201,Marge,"kids, i was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?"
60342,Marge,when who should ring the doorbell but ned flanders.
61811,Marge,my dessert!
59315,Marge,"boy, that sounds fun."
63580,Marge,i told you twenty times! you never listen!
62811,Marge,an albatross! it can lead us to safety.
63529,Marge,point zero nine.
64619,Marge,lisa is very sensitive. if something she loves dies in front of her--
67392,Marge,"homer, all these flies."
57565,Marge,"hairnets, everyone."
61942,Marge,"this is marge simpson, reporting from lake placid where the miracle on ice never happened."
67396,Marge,"look, homer! radish rosettes. these are hard to make. they are a very advanced race."
67052,Marge,"okay, bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. be nice to your sister."
59339,Marge,so it does.
54784,Marge,"well, i think what you're doing for mrs. glick is very nice. the poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
62472,Marge,david is so helpful...
64930,Marge,i think they were never my friends... maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a mommy and me class. they're random people you meet in a college dorm.
67503,Marge,now we can blame him for everything.
66545,Marge,"right. right, nothing."
63031,Marge,i guess i don't.
65103,Marge,uh-oh.
62162,Marge,"well, if he thinks he's getting a corner piece, forget it."
65740,Marge,and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school.
65741,Marge,"i'm not sure if you gave my son any... extra help. but if you did, thank you."
62486,Marge,"don't listen to them, maggie. maggie?"
64256,Marge,screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
57633,Marge,thank you for everything.
59001,Marge,i think some people are going to be upset.
56084,Marge,and my necklace.
60556,Marge,"homie, i don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
61982,Marge,"boy, what a night! moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. here, watch."
59497,Marge,sweet dreams.
58053,Marge,we have to make the most of the time we have.
62710,Marge,"everything's covered in foam. and it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
66237,Marge,because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.
61151,Marge,i'm really touched by how much you care.
67652,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?"
54610,Marge,well here's a question for you: why should i stay with a man who resents how i've flowered?
58448,Marge,"oh, my heart's beating like crazy."
59617,Marge,"they told us what to wear, how to dress, which clothes we should put on..."
67295,Marge,"well. when we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils."
66907,Marge,hello.
54596,Marge,i did tell you.
58345,Marge,you already have a monkey.
57129,Marge,"are you interested in that motorized tie rack, principal skinner?"
64897,Marge,why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
55294,Marge,i gotta go. homer...
60086,Marge,what? bart is dead!
57241,Marge,selma... about you and troy. we're not sure he's... all he seems.
62118,Marge,we need to start saving!
64703,Marge,whoops -- didn't time that quite right.
64933,Marge,"you know, this is the first time i've ever been at moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying ""this is not a safe place to drink."""
57983,Marge,i've left homer.
66629,Marge,"thank you, homie."
57586,Marge,who are you?
56093,Marge,oh my! i had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
65735,Marge,"excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school."
58731,Marge,it's so nice to have a peaceful weekend together.
66475,Marge,homie! you look like an n.b.a. coach!
58478,Marge,my poor homie. couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
61047,Marge,"turn it over, homer."
54936,Marge,"did you hear that, homer?"
58548,Marge,"oh, i'll come back later."
55873,Marge,i'm marge simpson. your new cellmate.
63952,Marge,i can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
57953,Marge,"that's right, i'm a witch! and i'm the one who withered your livestock, soured your sheeps' milk and made your shirts itchy."
67404,Marge,well leave it to good old mary bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
60645,Marge,mrs. bellamy?
61472,Marge,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
61110,Marge,"stop it, homer, that's inhumane! use the choke chain!"
55467,Marge,i'm only going to ask you one last time. are you sure you won't come with us to church?
59375,Marge,"homer, watch your lang... oooooh. that's a lifesaver."
56958,Marge,see? it was a good idea to come here after all.
65328,Marge,"lisa, i love spending mother-daughter time with you. we have so much in common, like... um... oh no! someone's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette!"
63839,Marge,"thank you so much, mister..."
65087,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, julio is my little secret! i've said too much!"
59414,Marge,you're on fire!
58414,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to take the kids with us to dinner."
66368,Marge,"hello. hello. i'm-i'm marge simpson. and i'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
67319,Marge,no. because you're wearing a bib.
62269,Marge,"don't worry about the competition, sweetie. whenever i enter a contest i tell myself i'm going to win because, sometimes, if you believe hard enough, god cuts you a break. after all, he works for us. our prayers pay his salary."
64133,Marge,"there is no ""we"" in wedding!"
63712,Marge,jeez louise. are you okay?
67894,Marge,i thought i did.
60704,Marge,"oh, homie..."
59683,Marge,"well, let me know when you get back to horror."
58433,Marge,ooh. there's the turn!
56574,Marge,i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
60971,Marge,"well this is very impressive, lisa. i'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
60613,Marge,"i put those ""cathys"" on the fridge for you. i don't even like them. they've gotten so smutty."
55310,Marge,white. and what would you like for appetizers?
58412,Marge,what are you doing?!
62240,Marge,i see ray too.
63898,Marge,where's bart? we're gonna be late for lenny's party.
60181,Marge,and burly's still got soaking power. spill something else.
56756,Marge,"we've got to be realistic, kids. who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
57560,Marge,mmm... hmm... that's not bad.
66538,Marge,"yes, for us. but not for lisa! never for lisa. we're going to help her make friends."
65287,Marge,"homie, you can win this argument! just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports!"
60470,Marge,why don't we double date? then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
63400,Marge,you give that to me!
57126,Marge,"can we get rid of this ""ayatollah"" t-shirt? khomeini died years ago."
56765,Marge,"i'm worried about the kids, homie. lisa's becoming very obsessive. this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
65255,Marge,"isn't that just a rip-off of ""the honeymooners?"""
59263,Marge,"i knew you had your hands full with the babies, so i baked you some banana bread."
58358,Marge,"well, we'd better start our love day clean-up. you kids take care of the wrapping paper. i'm going to dismantle love land."
59903,Marge,look! krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode.
62016,Marge,those are just reese's pieces.
61115,Marge,"give it a rest, barry."
57948,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
60300,Marge,"apu, everything in this store is overloaded with sugar."
59058,Marge,we were robbed?!
58445,Marge,"hm, something's not right. does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
61698,Marge,i don't care.
67654,Marge,when we're intimate?
58734,Marge,"okay... oh, leather craft."
65473,Marge,"got what, homer?"
59336,Marge,"oh, really? well, knock yourself out. just don't expect any miracles from those two."
62625,Marge,"lisa, i'm not sure that letter is ""age appropriate"" reading. why can't the government edit our mail like other countries?"
63850,Marge,harms no one? explain that to... well what about... i think you forgot about... hmm...
56446,Marge,that's what he wore to church.
57346,Marge,"okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... annnd maggie's enjoying her swingamajig..."
60289,Marge,"lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books."
66412,Marge,lisa! you've just gotta choose one. lisa!?
58381,Marge,"okay, honey. okay. i'll start taking in all your slacks."
65604,Marge,shush!
61531,Marge,my husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! do you know why no one likes you?
56172,Marge,homie!
64872,Marge,but you wanted those toys.
65068,Marge,you've never supported mine!
58613,Marge,"well, it's better than that last barbra streisand movie."
57945,Marge,"ohh, you want more syrup, honey?"
58872,Marge,"now if you'll excuse me, i've got some dust that needs busting."
55822,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
56890,Marge,the police already have a suspect. it's mr. smithers.
66161,Marge,you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city!
59435,Marge,i just don't think it's funny!
55702,Marge,mr. lanley? mr. lanley?
64517,Marge,"oooh, a cookbook!"
62076,Marge,"patty, it's not what you think. veronica is a man!"
60185,Marge,"oh, it's okay, homie. the bee's all gone."
64563,Marge,why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
67267,Marge,you sure have taken a shine to little adil.
60102,Marge,"sorry, sometimes i forget."
65615,Marge,"fine, he'll be around forever."
55292,Marge,what does that mean?
56915,Marge,what about maggie?
61588,Marge,"well, that's no promise at all!"
67812,Marge,"for five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. now it's your turn."
60764,Marge,"homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?"
59291,Marge,where are we going?
66701,Marge,"stop that, all of you. it's not bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid."
60322,Marge,professor frink?
67824,Marge,"oooh, this one looks very reputable."
65665,Marge,"homer, i think we should go. we're not like these people."
56910,Marge,"enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
65862,Marge,"but if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside..."
66949,Marge,"he's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard."
55133,Marge,"now maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
54825,Marge,i don't know how this could have happened.
62687,Marge,"reverend, why do we really need this?"
55476,Marge,you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
63509,Marge,"huh. thank you, crie! i'm huh... i'm sorry about the kick. i've never done anything like that before."
56709,Marge,why don't we all take a five minute break? it'll clear our heads.
60753,Marge,/ oh.
62658,Marge,that was your last pair! how did it happen?
62808,Marge,"yes, the weather is fair."
56729,Marge,"all right, who broke my vase?!"
64831,Marge,homer!
65962,Marge,"moe, this trip is about turning your life around."
64210,Marge,thank you!
65882,Marge,what's odd?
65311,Marge,"well, it's not just kids using springface -- it's moms like me. marge!"
58974,Marge,and you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
67920,Marge,what are you doing?
64559,Marge,and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
64035,Marge,just stop.
62906,Marge,"oh, i know all them!"
64447,Marge,homer! where are you?
57279,Marge,"record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. music is none of my business."
56407,Marge,"you know, you're right. this truly was the best vacation ever. now, let us never speak of it again."
67428,Marge,all this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
67814,Marge,you try it.
56233,Marge,"we don't think you're slow. but, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything."
61987,Marge,"ooh, that's a great idea."
61044,Marge,"here it is, this week's family activity."
63930,Marge,that's how low you can go!
58991,Marge,"the point is, great artists are always trying new things, like michelangelo or shaquille o'neal. you just need some inspiration."
59191,Marge,you're pouring hot butter on my leg!
63848,Marge,how could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
63754,Marge,and i realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.
60051,Marge,what spinal cord injury?
63352,Marge,the deadly truth about oxygen...
57614,Marge,i was just with dr. hibbert. he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
59866,Marge,would you boys like to play tennis?
59621,Marge,i haven't done the laundry yet.
55954,Marge,"no, i'm the head vampire!"
55392,Marge,"i haven't been in a play since high school, and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults."
60984,Marge,"oh sure. i mean, not on your father's salary, but i could... give piano lessons."
62175,Marge,"well, aren't you?"
56780,Marge,"bart, you said you were going to study."
60227,Marge,isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
66971,Marge,what?
66740,Marge,bart! hold the ladder still!
60347,Marge,but breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. maybe we can go.
62464,Marge,"well, i guess you showed you do trust me after all."
64166,Marge,"wait a second, marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?"
67379,Marge,i'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
59411,Marge,president clinton?!
67749,Marge,"well, you know, bart was looking at that racy movie today, and lisa's losing a little respect for you... maybe we should think about unhooking the cable."
60976,Marge,"okay, champ. i before e, except after c."
63903,Marge,"no flicking boogers, and no driving into trees!"
61185,Marge,well you ain't seen nothin' till you've seen the pre-teen braves.
63990,Marge,"your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people."
61583,Marge,"hey, you're right! what i enjoyed was spending time with my husband."
66334,Marge,such a good baby! you deserve some ice cream.
56466,Marge,"you caught me at a real bad time, moe. i hope you understand i'm too tense to pretend i like you."
55039,Marge,"""marge, from the first moment i saw you i never wanted to be with anyone else. i don't have much to offer you... except all my love. will you marry me?"""
66419,Marge,i've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirk's bachelor bad. i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
65531,Marge,"no, lisa! if you click that turnstile, it'll blow our budget!"
55669,Marge,"oh, homie, i was so frightened."
63808,Marge,"sweetie, i'm usually your number one fan. but, call me old-fashioned, i usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world."
56234,Marge,"oh homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better."
61800,Marge,thanks for taking the job. i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
66660,Marge,"no. you should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining! we've got a sweet little toddle to take care of!"
65118,Marge,just vote! it's your duty as a citizen of tv.
63294,Marge,still nothing. but maybe now. or now. the only thing that changes is the banner ad.
61294,Marge,is there any sign of my husband?
55282,Marge,don't lie to me. are you having an affair with this woman?
55985,Marge,"ooh, i've never been to an underground club."
60471,Marge,dude sure got his comeuppance.
57765,Marge,church shouldn't be a chore. it should help you in your daily life.
57706,Marge,isn't that clever? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building.
65422,Marge,which he didn't.
66791,Marge,my husband can't really think he's ten.
64344,Marge,"hold it right there, bub. what kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
66029,Marge,finally! actual science!
60118,Marge,and unusual.
65278,Marge,"everyone, it's a girl!"
63492,Marge,"okay maggie, say your goodnights."
64768,Marge,that is so sweet!
60376,Marge,i'm taking him to dr. hibbert's this afternoon. you know how hard it is to get a doctor on wednesday morning.
58075,Marge,for me?
54905,Marge,"krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? you'll feel better."
59751,Marge,you're a pretty girl.
66682,Marge,our water was on fire!
56058,Marge,why?
56646,Marge,i'll just have a cup of coffee.
61086,Marge,i still think you should have left that at the motel.
57474,Marge,"an automatic dialer? is that legal? i don't want you getting arrested, homer..."
65624,Marge,you never looked up to him.
58438,Marge,very close...
67355,Marge,"hello, homie. how's my big important executive?"
58555,Marge,"actually, it took fifty-three hours."
67406,Marge,"homer, we're a mary bailey family."
58488,Marge,you're thirty-nine.
55087,Marge,"i'll get some at the store tomorrow, homer."
56023,Marge,kids. tell me the truth. am i no fun? do i just nag all the time?
66384,Marge,we're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!
61867,Marge,"whaddya say? it'll be blam! bart, lisa and mom. huh?"
61467,Marge,i also found this in your drawer.
63263,Marge,"okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. for me, it's the family photo album."
57039,Marge,"oh, my little sugar-bug... i'm so glad you're safe..."
65408,Marge,sounds like a plan!
58807,Marge,oh dear.
60532,Marge,"aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi."
64274,Marge,maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect.
62060,Marge,oh no. no no. no. i'm just... surprised.
60903,Marge,i can't take drugs -- i have so many anti-drug bumper stickers. i'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.
61136,Marge,what's all that rustling?
54890,Marge,"mrs. van houten, i'm bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
55595,Marge,don quixote?
60138,Marge,but first we gotta break out of these stocks.
54911,Marge,look everybody! my purse exploded!
60617,Marge,"a koi pond! it's beautiful. oh you sweet, wonderful man-child. i finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts."
67104,Marge,"no way, jose."
61526,Marge,we had one date. and you were not a gentleman.
57604,Marge,"all right, kids. we'll meet you at the top. just be careful!"
58008,Marge,"ooo, he's quite a little dancer."
56454,Marge,no.
65921,Marge,"homer, i'm glad that you tried, even though now i can't find the washing machine."
60205,Marge,"well, is anything coming back to you?"
59980,Marge,he doesn't look so fast to me.
57974,Marge,"homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table."
59907,Marge,perfect.
60154,Marge,what's that noise?
65437,Marge,"bart's not home yet, but i'm always looking to encourage non-milhouse play-dates. stick around!"
60071,Marge,the buffalo are gone. i think you shot them all.
55260,Marge,here boy!
59691,Marge,with a song about thrift!
61303,Marge,you and lisa better go find homes for these puppies -- and don't just dump them all off on some crazy lady.
66691,Marge,i am so pleased to meet you.
56313,Marge,"that's not the idea at all. okay, well this story isn't ideal, i've never told it to you before."
59972,Marge,"homer, no! those were made in the sixties."
63758,Marge,get in!
58547,Marge,"bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here."
54635,Marge,are you saying that america was founded on... misconceptions?
58723,Marge,"oh, homer..."
66895,Marge,i'm going to do what i should've done in the first place.
57492,Marge,ned! maude! you've got to go back to your house. something incredible has happened!
56623,Marge,"""a young springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'the bart simpson comet.'"" oh honey, i'm so proud of you."
62320,Marge,how 'bout this one -- st. jerome's catholic school?
58318,Marge,"bart, it's too nice a day to leave ralph in a closet. you boys should go play outside."
55707,Marge,homer.
58801,Marge,"oh, yeah, homer's a real go-getter."
67124,Marge,...and my sisters.
61064,Marge,i'll fix you something.
58002,Marge,"i'm talking about his ""personal area."""
63895,Marge,i just made a thirty-seven hundred mile car trip. i need to wash up.
61756,Marge,there's a ship! we're saved!
58100,Marge,"some people would call it ""cozy."""
62551,Marge,"homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that salamander suit. you look like the mascot for some horrible southern college."
57596,Marge,"oh, it's just a mob war. go back to sleep, honey."
64515,Marge,what happened next?
56210,Marge,"hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! i made a special cake for you to ruin. it's over there."
61457,Marge,boring? is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
61515,Marge,"you took little children to ""the re-deadening""?!"
62938,Marge,"i never heard anything about it on the gossip shows, or the blogosphere or in my supermarket check-out magazine."
59345,Marge,"well, it has been a week."
65915,Marge,it's a snuggle dungeon!
57460,Marge,you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
65220,Marge,it's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
55715,Marge,"kids, i have some bad news. your great aunt gladys has... passed on."
62697,Marge,"what do you think, maggie?"
66948,Marge,and a short temper.
64095,Marge,i'm sorry. but i know god would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... again.
58842,Marge,no one has ever asked me that before in my life.
57915,Marge,"with nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
65659,Marge,oh... satire.
62172,Marge,then it's agreed! we ask frank gehry to build us a concert hall!
58743,Marge,it's vincent price! i thought he was dead.
62363,Marge,i love you too...
60992,Marge,sara sloane has been involved with every tinseltown hunk from affleck to zmed!
64980,Marge,oh.
63116,Marge,"bartholomew j. simpson, how can you be so mean?"
57355,Marge,"no, i don't."
56540,Marge,but i...
56229,Marge,"mom, you can't marry mr. burns! he's an evil man!"
65205,Marge,"and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. it's too crazy for you."
67369,Marge,"come here. ""you are so beautiful to me / you are so beautiful to me / can't you see? / you're everything that i hoped for /"
67786,Marge,"well, you want to try that h. powell?"
62982,Marge,and i can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
64774,Marge,"what do you mean, this one?"
58754,Marge,"homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. why don't you talk to the producers of the show? maybe they'll make your character suave again."
67796,Marge,"ohh, dear."
59183,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
67245,Marge,"i know how you like 'em, homer."
65337,Marge,this house is not an embarrassment!
63457,Marge,"i understand, homie."
61178,Marge,what are we gonna do to that field?
59056,Marge,i guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world.
63714,Marge,"your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying. so i hired this nutritionist, betsy bidwell."
59815,Marge,"i don't see any anger. i see a yearning for freedom... um, do you have a title?"
58283,Marge,"um, you're just having a bad day. i had one last week. i burned the roast, my cake fell, and i ran out of butter so i had to spray the english muffins with pam."
54704,Marge,"still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner."
61453,Marge,"and today, lewis' promise has been fulfilled."
61686,Marge,let's see how your sister's doing in the place-setting competition.
62371,Marge,maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.
62462,Marge,just do it! trust me!
61040,Marge,homie?
57262,Marge,there. now that gum should lift right out.
60224,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
67306,Marge,"but, homer, it's so expensive."
58952,Marge,"well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
56005,Marge,"well, bye."
63371,Marge,"well, uh..."
56099,Marge,well...
57760,Marge,"lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
63277,Marge,"oh, it is not! watch me."
61819,Marge,you did it on purpose?
58935,Marge,i would have feigned interest.
57089,Marge,"goodnight, sweetheart."
60139,Marge,"i want goggles, too."
67337,Marge,"in a second, homer. lisa has some good news."
66833,Marge,who's he giving a piggyback ride to?
58839,Marge,"ooh! oh, i guess i can drive it for a little while."
55043,Marge,"well, how about louie?"
56536,Marge,"no, no honey, it's all right. really. i'm fine. i'm all right. mother always said ""don't complain. be good. behave, behave. be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
62449,Marge,you don't trust me? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! how dare you!
58359,Marge,i heard that! you know the rule.
63918,Marge,i said they were thrill-crazed drug seekers. don't put words in my mouth!
58700,Marge,we'd better stop and get the car washed.
60870,Marge,"sorry, i can't go outside. i'll call for help."
56914,Marge,"homie, this is so sweet. but i can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess..."
55776,Marge,"homie, i'd like you to do something for me."
66083,Marge,"yeah. alone, i'm sure."
57874,Marge,if only i didn't already have a pair of shoes.
58481,Marge,"i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance. it's a little thick, but the price is right."
59820,Marge,i might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
67868,Marge,i can't believe it.
63886,Marge,are we ever going to find him?
63276,Marge,"well, i do like the extra money. but i think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes."
61447,Marge,"no problem! in elementary school, we girls learned about sacagawea while the boys were learning math!"
55588,Marge,that's sweet.
66811,Marge,"so what brings you to springfield, mr. musk?"
62649,Marge,that's a female replacement hormone.
60016,Marge,"we've gotta get to the hospital, homer!"
58566,Marge,i can't believe it. that's horrible! who'll run the kwik-e-mart?
55972,Marge,"well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there."
59441,Marge,hmm. a night out is a night out.
65251,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad you're not an accounts man anymore."
58041,Marge,"well... your mother, for one."
65016,Marge,i'm not a hoarder! do the yankees hoard pennants? does marrakesh hoard intrigue?
62514,Marge,stop the showcase!
58851,Marge,canyonero!
63213,Marge,shut up!
57462,Marge,"homie, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep."
60568,Marge,"hm, that little girl sure loved dots."
56184,Marge,"bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
63814,Marge,none of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you.
66841,Marge,"it's because everything you love, you love so much."
60160,Marge,i thought this was gonna be your bar.
60478,Marge,"oh, no. there's gambling. we just have to find it."
62154,Marge,"oh my god, there they are!"
55385,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful."
55112,Marge,"oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
63857,Marge,"homie, i've got a confession to make: i'm an erotic baker."
66059,Marge,"save that sugar for your coffee, bub."
56669,Marge,what's that supposed to mean?
58356,Marge,"it's a ""kisses-make-me-boogie-o-lantern."""
64877,Marge,right before christmas?
66916,Marge,you will not be getting a tattoo for christmas.
65226,Marge,"welcome home, handsome!"
64060,Marge,"come on, kids! let's take our stuff back inside."
59297,Marge,"and when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
55001,Marge,we heard! isn't it wonderful? we have some great plans for that money.
64143,Marge,and... release the groom.
54961,Marge,"lisa, i hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
64114,Marge,kirk and luann split up...
65559,Marge,everyone relax. i think i've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere.
67407,Marge,"well, frankly, i don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known."
67545,Marge,"well, i've never changed the world before, so i don't know how long it takes exactly. but if enough people take an interest..."
61277,Marge,"homer, you couldn't be in more trouble. they're going to put your head on a pike. they're practicing with melons."
54920,Marge,now hadn't you better get ready for school?
64316,Marge,"if i'm gonna open a can of whup-tushy, i'd better get in shape, with some rhythmic gymnastics!"
63614,Marge,"i've lost my perfect twenty-six, twenty-six, twenty-six figure."
58483,Marge,"oh, honey. a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. unless it was especially skilled. or one of those super-babies from brazil."
64315,Marge,"i can't back out. this is for a cause that's bigger than i am. if gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, i can do this. besides, i'm a woman. he'll probably go easy on me."
64289,Marge,"i googled ""girls having fun,"" and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, i found ""crazy bowling."""
62044,Marge,"it's ""win a hawaiian getaway week"" on channel six."
64552,Marge,i'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. i've got them right here.
57963,Marge,it's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
54657,Marge,...make him feel good about himself.
63092,Marge,"i'm so glad you like it, moe."
65000,Marge,awww.
66303,Marge,"homie, do you really think you should be--"
55396,Marge,i'm auditioning for a play.
66778,Marge,homer!
55569,Marge,"hmm, actually, i was thinking of ""funny hat day."""
60207,Marge,maybe there's murder afoot!
64351,Marge,"i stopped my crying / why, i don't know / but this rosey, cozy, bubbles-in-my-nose-y / makes me wanna have... mo'!"
63734,Marge,it's upstairs in my disappointment closet.
66239,Marge,"i thought i'd show you this when you were older, but..."
59019,Marge,i want you to get rid of these springs.
63684,Marge,"speaking of disasters, have you seen this? springfield dodge bought too much inventory, and they've only got one weekend to get rid of all the '07s!"
57178,Marge,uh-huh.
57254,Marge,of course i'll accept! bart! i've missed you so mu-- you want to speak to lisa?
67890,Marge,i can't make that man beautiful. i'm just not good enough. i guess i'm no artist.
61950,Marge,"well, i like t-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
61669,Marge,"you're right, but where do we go?"
64137,Marge,bridezilla? a combination of bride and godzilla? how could you say that? more like you're a... king wrong!
59941,Marge,"chew, chew, chew! swallow, swallow, swallow!"
67874,Marge,i don't think that will be a problem.
67186,Marge,"hm, yes, i am, as a matter of fact. here's more treats. but don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner."
67218,Marge,go take some wildlife pictures or something.
63322,Marge,"i need a dress to wear for my son's big game. he's the star, i'm his mom, and he's my son."
58180,Marge,get to work!
67906,Marge,no.
66771,Marge,"homer, please! that's creeping me out!"
64718,Marge,dammit.
57136,Marge,"well homer, too. they're so much alike."
58967,Marge,"i'm sure god will let us return soon. i mean, how long can he hold a grudge?"
61608,Marge,"ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
65739,Marge,"well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"
59690,Marge,"oh, i might be able to help you..."
62436,Marge,welcome to our pox party. save room for punch -- maggie's bathing in the bowl!
60370,Marge,"oh homer, save me, save me!"
67656,Marge,you looked so peaceful lying there.
62447,Marge,fine... no!
57302,Marge,put food in me.
57898,Marge,and you knew where you were then...
59566,Marge,"becky, what have i done here? i'm so sorry."
58397,Marge,we've got to get you to a doctor right away.
59812,Marge,"yeah, see how much better that feels?"
61555,Marge,"moe's tavern? that's your fun place, like me and the lamp store."
66981,Marge,"oh, homer, mr. burns just said he liked it. once."
64423,Marge,"bart, you've always been a handful, but you've never interfered with my reproductive freedom. why now?"
57716,Marge,"what happened to you, homer? and what have you done to the car?"
55481,Marge,i know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
64302,Marge,maybe someday you can do lisa's wedding!
65358,Marge,"please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. we just wanna live out our lives in peace."
55579,Marge,you can't fire me just because i'm married. i'm going to sue the pants off you.
67626,Marge,...so i guess that may not count as anguish.
65348,Marge,why are all those cars parked at city hall?
67092,Marge,"oh homer, you promised me..."
63796,Marge,"lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. maggie and i are washing the soiled foam fingers."
66906,Marge,"isn't bart sweet, homer? he sings like a little angel."
63931,Marge,why are you dancing with that strange woman?
60437,Marge,"i hope you enjoy these german sausages. i've been grinding all day, so i'm not sure what organ meat is in what intestinal casing."
58671,Marge,homer!
60429,Marge,"goodnight, homie."
66859,Marge,no!
55291,Marge,hmmm. i thought you said she was overweight!
65655,Marge,"homie, you have such a way with foods. let's go inside."
59634,Marge,i shot the sheriff / but i did not shoot the dep-u-ty
60714,Marge,"that was great, homie."
55905,Marge,"no, he hasn't."
58111,Marge,mm-hmm.
57393,Marge,you know how i feel about hoaxes!
66062,Marge,good question.
55950,Marge,"lisa, stop being so suspicious. did everyone wash their necks like mr. burns asked?"
65468,Marge,stop saying what you call things! i'm trying to watch the movie!
63826,Marge,"hmm, it smells like concerts!"
63992,Marge,but he'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators.
64771,Marge,"no, it was berry-peach!"
66058,Marge,yes. and it's a big one. remember?
59779,Marge,do you feel smarter?
59995,Marge,ho-mer.
58524,Marge,"oh, no you won't."
55801,Marge,lisa needs braces.
56805,Marge,"strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. i'm crossing over to deviled ham. whoa!"
67509,Marge,"ooo, i think there's one over there."
63098,Marge,you can't go to work! i need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
60156,Marge,"that's odd. he's outside, digging."
60689,Marge,oh well.
62095,Marge,do it for me.
57385,Marge,he sexually harassed me.
59253,Marge,"say, whatcha got there?"
63777,Marge,there's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do. and that person is right here!
65696,Marge,maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
59225,Marge,"no, but i use only the fre..."
67605,Marge,"oh, bart! we thought for a minute you'd gone away from us."
58791,Marge,"well, i'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage?"
60758,Marge,"homie! oooo, homie... hey, what happened?"
57672,Marge,come on. you liked john this morning.
66827,Marge,"thank you, lord. and i'll give up online scrapbooking like i promised."
56872,Marge,i choose to take that literally.
67249,Marge,deportation! you mean kick bart out of the country?
61998,Marge,i don't know what to say.
67464,Marge,now i suppose you both have to sign this. i hope blood won't be necessary.
66808,Marge,maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.
60365,Marge,"good, good, that feels good."
60468,Marge,"all right, grampa. i'll help you get your license back."
67759,Marge,"here you go, homie."
67036,Marge,"oh, homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck."
58823,Marge,you just don't get it.
64211,Marge,the what?
58732,Marge,"mm-hm. hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits aunt patty always gives us?"
66596,Marge,lakwando's mind won't be on the game. aaaand benched.
62215,Marge,"well, he does seem happy here..."
60474,Marge,he is your dad.
57687,Marge,"we're very proud of you, by the way."
57630,Marge,"that shary bobbins is a miracle worker. the kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. it's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!"
61709,Marge,"i'll start from the beginning. the girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. now that i've captured your interest, let me continue..."
57153,Marge,"bart, comb your hair. homer, i don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
67210,Marge,homer!
64040,Marge,yeah!
55858,Marge,there is no such thing.
57283,Marge,you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
63208,Marge,"so you see homer, revenge only leads to misery."
61572,Marge,i'm not a drunk!
67378,Marge,"children, get your coats. we're leaving this house right now."
57975,Marge,it's the same table!
61634,Marge,i do!
59013,Marge,"so, bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
63523,Marge,"really? look at you... so grown up... well, i've moved on too..."
58147,Marge,"i know you're used to getting hate mail, but i'm not."
65406,Marge,and maybe you'll stop overeating too!
65018,Marge,"it's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance..."
56350,Marge,they hit it off right away. but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand...
64735,Marge,homer! take me home!
61080,Marge,"well, you'll never have to."
63783,Marge,"you two have been bombarded with enough commercial images! lisa, i've got a big bunch of black bananas. you know what that means..."
63283,Marge,i can't fill out that clipboard. i... don't have email.
65050,Marge,what?! what? what will we eat?
66655,Marge,hear hear!
55752,Marge,"why didn't you ask our permission, lisa?"
64125,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. but that's an awful lot to pay for a dress i'll only wear once."
57113,Marge,all right.
58175,Marge,the kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean.
66273,Marge,not now. take out that pillow and put it in room three.
67044,Marge,"good night, homer."
55763,Marge,"homer, i want you to encourage lisa with her science fair project."
54801,Marge,"bart, you have to help someone in need. it's the only decent thing to do."
57690,Marge,which is impossible!
61297,Marge,you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
63815,Marge,food?
61759,Marge,"and yet, i miss america."
56726,Marge,"lisa, i can't believe it's your wedding day already."
62818,Marge,maybe not so loveable...
64474,Marge,thank you.
55042,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking. if the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name larry?"
66879,Marge,uh... pop culture and current events.
59193,Marge,"oh my, war is terrible."
63130,Marge,you have a bigger problem out there.
54953,Marge,homer...
62711,Marge,where's bart? i haven't seen him since you came home.
63786,Marge,we're putting a stop to this right now!
58021,Marge,"wellll, look who's the ladies' man..."
59578,Marge,hello. hel-looo.
59378,Marge,"stop swirling, homer!"
57280,Marge,"well, good. try to include bart and lisa."
67425,Marge,"well, he's a fine role model. bart, give me that ball!"
63142,Marge,"please, just a few more days."
67290,Marge,you forgot the special lunches i made.
62507,Marge,no.
56299,Marge,"homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
54987,Marge,"bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
57403,Marge,"uh, you know, i think i'll take maggie with us."
66913,Marge,"a pony? oh, lisa. you've asked for that for the last three years and i keep telling you santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. can't you take a hint?"
58425,Marge,ooh! ooh! ooh! ooh! sorry! sorry! sorry! do you want me to?
57180,Marge,"oh, i give up."
56955,Marge,"that's it, honey. get into the spirit."
59960,Marge,"isn't that a little excessive? i mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
63369,Marge,just let the chemicals deal with it.
65123,Marge,"it's big to you. would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"
65697,Marge,did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
64036,Marge,"sweetheart, i think you'll feel better after we take a little walk..."
62681,Marge,oh...
59608,Marge,"oh, my. i've been so unfair to becky. maybe i am insane. i mean, i am talking to myself."
67873,Marge,"well, no... just ringo starr."
61900,Marge,"well, it is good to see you, chloe. would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow?"
59533,Marge,i remember little vicki valentine! her perky smile and dancing brought america right out of the depression.
67695,Marge,"hmm, i don't know."
55227,Marge,"lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. but they don't always know what they're talking about."
62129,Marge,"don't you think you've had enough ""fun?"""
55880,Marge,"oh honey, i've missed you too. homer, is that an old halloween costume?"
59289,Marge,and you still don't...
65110,Marge,"i hope you're proud of yourself, homer."
65893,Marge,i think i'm interesting!
66246,Marge,"sweetie, about the submarine... what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? i'm going shopping tomorrow."
62307,Marge,"you've got a big house, ned. if you need extra money, why don't you rent out a room?"
61444,Marge,i know a little something about history. gather 'round.
66523,Marge,"you're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late."
64259,Marge,all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. unless you're not man enough.
60877,Marge,two...
62676,Marge,you never had detention all summer.
65163,Marge,"it's not fair. moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff."
63469,Marge,longer!
65583,Marge,my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday...
55759,Marge,and this is for my huggy bug in honor of this special day.
60928,Marge,i'll just call a plumber.
55328,Marge,homer!
63120,Marge,you're getting a husband! and you are going to that party!
61914,Marge,"well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in springfield with our sweethearts?"
61796,Marge,"okay, here's your precious articles."
57216,Marge,"kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
64070,Marge,ned! i think we have a gas leak!
56793,Marge,"homie, these games are fixed."
61481,Marge,"and to remind you of what you've done, i'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions."
59311,Marge,what will become of our kids?
62790,Marge,you're just a sweet guy from springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
61466,Marge,"homie, i'd like to know what you've been doing after work."
60688,Marge,my homie's dead? how will i go on?
64455,Marge,lettuce... congratulate the new couple.
64058,Marge,ned! you bought our house? why?
65746,Marge,"what, 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top?"
56797,Marge,somebody stop him!
57903,Marge,"ooh, there's the bus. goodbye, sweetheart!"
62223,Marge,he's become one of them!
57987,Marge,"not right now, dear."
66265,Marge,"well, they don't grow on trees."
55367,Marge,"well, i really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
65521,Marge,homer!
61748,Marge,"well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride."
60362,Marge,this place is so dull. the nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
65688,Marge,stop your trendy arguing! i'm trying to call the fire department!
55128,Marge,but gambling is illegal.
55510,Marge,"thank you, dear. now be good for grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. we'll bring back dinner."
64698,Marge,"have fun, homie."
60439,Marge,it's so clean and bland. i'm home!
56833,Marge,"moe, i've never seen you here before."
63391,Marge,no street curs!
60395,Marge,"artie ziff? ohh, oh, that e-mail. look, i got a little drunk and we..."
63654,Marge,stop it! stop it!!! i'll watch the commercials!
59213,Marge,you got that from a movie poster!
63037,Marge,your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is!
65763,Marge,"homer, my sisters adopted ling and she's doing great."
60843,Marge,i get to tamp the powder!
65797,Marge,"you're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause i still like the dog."
66626,Marge,shauna! i saw that! i'm going to have to let you go.
58693,Marge,homer! i don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
59148,Marge,i think we should take him off the drug.
58476,Marge,with cans of grease?
56642,Marge,bart!
64857,Marge,are you sure?
54683,Marge,that is so beautiful.
63704,Marge,"all right! this is a story of two dogs with a love so strong, no hose could separate them. i call it shady and the vamp..."
62722,Marge,ned... rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own.
60545,Marge,"homer, i'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom."
63987,Marge,i don't know. all it takes is one troubled loner.
66935,Marge,"but homer, my sisters are here. don't you want to say hello?"
66290,Marge,maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
63975,Marge,what have you done with the old ones?
66779,Marge,thank god it's just like her busy box.
59688,Marge,"sure, go ahead."
58776,Marge,"oh, no!"
63905,Marge,"bart, i've had it with you! i'm taking away all your tv privileges."
65877,Marge,power.
58062,Marge,"stop, homer! stop it! let me out!"
59525,Marge,you should get your eyes checked. i'm taking bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
66738,Marge,"stop feeling sorry for yourself. your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent."
67607,Marge,"is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
59106,Marge,homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
60364,Marge,"boy, things are going really good. good, good, good, good, good, good, good. hmm, look at that freckle. i should dig that out."
64690,Marge,hyper!
65701,Marge,focus!
63671,Marge,my eye!
63951,Marge,"homer, those are our wedding bungees!"
57165,Marge,queen of hearts. i believe all the rest are ours.
61198,Marge,"oh, lord."
61223,Marge,this is more violent than the hip hop awards. you've got to stop your father!
55741,Marge,"oh my god, you're delirious."
60273,Marge,"my driving ankle! bart, i know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?"
62137,Marge,i melted string cheese over some corn chips!
58895,Marge,show biz is so fascinating.
61375,Marge,"they say ""yes no two forty-two"". and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out!"
65705,Marge,homie?
62833,Marge,you never take our kids to the movies.
59168,Marge,only your father could take a part-time job at a small-town paper and wind up the target of international assassins.
64340,Marge,i don't see the safe zone anywhere.
55494,Marge,what's he saying?
62176,Marge,i'm so excited. it's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron.
62327,Marge,"well, homer and bart are well, they're under the weather."
61681,Marge,you've been to space.
63365,Marge,that's the fire siren!
66340,Marge,everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
58084,Marge,my pleasure.
56356,Marge,"artie, please!"
58643,Marge,"no, no, you just stay put."
66888,Marge,"i'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. but until then, i appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
60049,Marge,you could give the money to the orphanage. i hear they need a new wall.
64467,Marge,we've got a million dollars?! screw the toast!
64350,Marge,it tastes like hot steaming cocoa mixed with rainbows...
56134,Marge,"don't worry, kids, i'm sure your father's all right."
62270,Marge,"lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!"
64493,Marge,"homer, who's that?"
63840,Marge,"marge simpson. well, mr. farrelly, the least i could do is offer you a cupcake."
65147,Marge,"homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? mr. burns, sideshow bob..."
60749,Marge,"accidentally giving me breast implants is not a ""simple misunderstanding."" my surgery was botched!"
60350,Marge,oh. it's just a false alarm.
57350,Marge,"i've been so bored since we moved here, i've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. i know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but i just can't drink that much."
56057,Marge,"then how 'about going as florida? you enjoy orange juice, and old people like you."
57679,Marge,"homer, john brought us cactus candy!"
59050,Marge,"homer, i've never seen this side of you! but i like it..."
61621,Marge,you just say...
65702,Marge,"well, tell us your version."
62051,Marge,but reverend... scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament's proscriptions.
67781,Marge,"very nicely said, homer."
67900,Marge,hmmm huh.
61067,Marge,well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
56401,Marge,how were you a political prisoner?
66378,Marge,"another seminar tomorrow. i just wish i could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
65169,Marge,"i'm sorry, gang. i blew it."
57407,Marge,"""maison derriere""?! i can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart to work there?"
59466,Marge,"it's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..."" well, isn't that clever? it's a metaphor."
55397,Marge,"i told you several times. it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named..."""
62356,Marge,away from you.
61226,Marge,why is bart so tall? and shaggy?
56688,Marge,yes!
64319,Marge,listen... i'm late for a p.t.a. meeting.
54608,Marge,"homie, go home. we'll talk about this later."
66389,Marge,no kennels!
55672,Marge,seventy dollars.
58962,Marge,i'm toiling! what does it look like?
55233,Marge,i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. we each play our birthday. and that's enough excitement for me.
62966,Marge,"i hope you're happy, bart. thanks to your hi-jinx, i have to drive you and your friends to school."
64199,Marge,"excuse me, i'm feeling a little... over-hydrated."
62111,Marge,honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. what would the kids and i do if something happened to you?
55948,Marge,"homer, stop picking at it."
57345,Marge,"mr. scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. i keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
64424,Marge,"oh, barty, i'm sorry. but your father and i think that three kids is just perfect."
64126,Marge,uh... a princess?
59929,Marge,you're really not gonna eat anything?
60067,Marge,soon. i just need a few more yoga classes.
65558,Marge,"""i'll get to it, marge..."" ""i'll get to it..."" when we first got married, he'd only take six months to do things..."
63744,Marge,uh-oh.
64200,Marge,gotta find a place to tinkle.
60725,Marge,now your fannies match.
65890,Marge,so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
55639,Marge,you don't have a cousin frank.
67804,Marge,"well, then, feed him!"
56456,Marge,"absolutely, honey. by blocking the net i really think you helped your team."
54865,Marge,"so bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
59620,Marge,"homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show. finally, i said, ""so, do it! either shit or get off the pot."""
64309,Marge,"chett, i'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
54982,Marge,"oh really? well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
55832,Marge,what did you way?
66632,Marge,"i was short-staffed and your father volunteered. actually, i was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand."
55134,Marge,"extra mustard for bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... light mayo for lisa, cut off the crust... double bologna for homer...."
56819,Marge,"homer, give me my pepper spray."
61926,Marge,no one's fighting over you!
60759,Marge,"now, don't get too used to these. that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days."
61440,Marge,"oh, homie! you're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book."
57538,Marge,"i don't believe you, homer."
66672,Marge,i also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
63448,Marge,really?
59428,Marge,"from now on, one of us always stays home."
64834,Marge,"homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
63234,Marge,"wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! a good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! and i went along with it, because i love him to pieces! and you made him look like a fool. well, i don't want you anywhere near my house!"
67206,Marge,"goodbye, homer."
59759,Marge,"okay, players! that's a wrap!"
56788,Marge,"hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him."
66553,Marge,"lisa, just say something to me."
65626,Marge,that kind of romance leads to children.
57912,Marge,"homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did."
60480,Marge,bill... bill...
67583,Marge,oh dear!
59032,Marge,"well, it's not really on our walking route..."
59014,Marge,sounds good to me!
67513,Marge,"wow, a woman mud-pull driver."
57144,Marge,"oh, sure i do. i treated myself to a sanka not three days ago. but this is a real find."
58840,Marge,hang on. the manual says i need to log on to the onboard computer.
67179,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
55440,Marge,"whoever you are, i have always depended on the kindness of strangers."
60867,Marge,let's go home. there's nothing dangerous there except for the electrical wiring.
64381,Marge,"some lingerie from ""the horny hubby""... and ""snuggle"" dice."
58897,Marge,"is that somebody you, homer?"
60541,Marge,"i've tried heckling them, i've tried jeckling them, it's time i made myself a scarecrow."
64537,Marge,i said he could take a break.
66197,Marge,"it's me, talking in your earphone!"
65132,Marge,how did that happen?
64809,Marge,no. just a picture of lisa. who wants to be nothing like me.
65750,Marge,"homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me."
66680,Marge,i guess i do.
65432,Marge,on the ground!
62265,Marge,no you didn't.
64328,Marge,"really? oh, thank you."
59795,Marge,"well, look at that painting."
66280,Marge,that one creeps me out from the beginning.
58599,Marge,stop calling everyone suckers!
66387,Marge,"oh, urgent notice."
58446,Marge,"what's wrong with us, homer? have we lost the spark already?"
64094,Marge,you're even more beautiful than i remembered.
56245,Marge,"homer, don't you have to get to class?"
62791,Marge,it's may!
63683,Marge,stop all this pandering!
57322,Marge,"the polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. shoo, shoo!"
57958,Marge,what a day! they found out i was a witch so i had to leave my family.
67625,Marge,"...although he doesn't really like school all that much,"
63794,Marge,"okay, have fun at the laughter house. now i'll just turn off my phone to save the battery."
57033,Marge,"kids, everything's going to be okay! don't panic! just don't panic!"
61165,Marge,"ned, i am so sorry."
58496,Marge,something electrical might be good.
58526,Marge,"nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. he needs to be isolated from everyone."
63634,Marge,you also remembered i like flattery!
58168,Marge,"actually, we're done."
63755,Marge,"i'm taking you to your home, before you wreck mine!"
57714,Marge,no! no more drinking! i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
67939,Marge,"hi, bart! it's your mom! i'm in your videogame with you!"
67722,Marge,homer?
55100,Marge,"oh bart, i've missed you so much."
67549,Marge,i've started a crusade against cartoon violence.
65744,Marge,we have to do something until the storm passes. now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started.
57330,Marge,"oh, finish your fish heads. then we'll talk."
61722,Marge,"no, homer."
67738,Marge,"""myth: it's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. fact: most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam."" hmm, well, i don't know."
60913,Marge,i wasn't asking.
65935,Marge,so charming. it's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.
57485,Marge,one at a time.
61690,Marge,i'm not being trampled. what gives?
60271,Marge,"food keeps my family happy, so i make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'cause at six o'clock, we go live!"
65426,Marge,"bart, no dinner means no dessert."
62900,Marge,i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
66755,Marge,no answer. let's go find your father.
63325,Marge,bart's coming down!
65136,Marge,ooh! we can wear those to the nice mall!
60641,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry. i can't. i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. the kids growing up, grandchildren..."
67510,Marge,homer.
61368,Marge,"you're my rock, homie."
55417,Marge,it'll just take a sec.
64004,Marge,"who is this ""mom"" of which you speak?"
56611,Marge,"ooh, i don't have that."
64625,Marge,"what is it, ned?"
65687,Marge,"c'mere, little buddy."
59640,Marge,... which homer writes himself.
58780,Marge,chesty larue?!
54964,Marge,"homer, can you get the door? it's my sisters."
59534,Marge,"don't smart mouth, lisa."
59867,Marge,"okay, we'll be right out."
64894,Marge,"homie, i know you had a terrible experience, but it's over."
63155,Marge,gil!
55448,Marge,"well, maybe just a little."
66319,Marge,what's so funny?
57676,Marge,"so if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
57360,Marge,that's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.
62535,Marge,really? could we do a duet?
57778,Marge,"okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
62882,Marge,"that works for hiccups, not amnesia."
64140,Marge,"okay, it's go time."
57160,Marge,"oh, that reminds me of a funny apron i saw..."
66922,Marge,"oh, i have my secrets. turn around."
67682,Marge,"oh, the shop kids are smoking again."
63308,Marge,i should get some sleep...
55696,Marge,"according to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. what if something goes wrong?"
59285,Marge,"just put it on my sewing pile. okay, i'm doing another load of bandanas!"
65539,Marge,now what?
66323,Marge,i'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
60649,Marge,"finally, some repression."
63476,Marge,"you are out of control! the late nights, the eating! you've actually outgrown your cape!"
58659,Marge,and 40 percent more rootin' tootin'!
66018,Marge,"you are unique, you are special, and at some point that's gonna come together and work for you. i know it."
67388,Marge,look at me. i've never been so angry. my hands are shaking.
62396,Marge,"this is a little too spooky for me. i don't even like watching ""the count"" on sesame street."
61360,Marge,but i haven't endorsed it yet!
67535,Marge,i'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons. i don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before.
64630,Marge,"homer, maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween. what's going on?"
66983,Marge,"oh, i'm not much of a drinker."
59399,Marge,i wish people would stop telling me to step right up.
63462,Marge,be my guest.
55961,Marge,"hello, ruth?"
62809,Marge,"homer, i can't believe i was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
62156,Marge,"we'll stop fighting, we promise!"
57315,Marge,"gee, i don't know what you've got planned for tonight, homer, but count me out. didn't you buy any meat?"
65839,Marge,i think your dad might be gay.
62160,Marge,my kids are on your boat -- turn back!
66487,Marge,horses only live thirty years!
67897,Marge,your father does that to me.
56618,Marge,my contractions started an hour ago.
67018,Marge,"homer, how wonderful. our first pleasant surprise."
60315,Marge,don't worry. i'll do the legwork.
60766,Marge,maybe i'll just keep these.
67187,Marge,"goodbye, lisa. my darling little lisa."
65488,Marge,ned and edna married?
58554,Marge,hmm... it's starting to cool down. i'll bake another pie.
63648,Marge,i think i'll speed through the cheering.
64360,Marge,"i call to order this meeting of the ""springfield charity chicks."" as you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity."
67534,Marge,homer! i'm trying to work!
65620,Marge,got it. papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
63926,Marge,that's the fuel gauge.
60502,Marge,"wow, everything is so high-tech."
56689,Marge,"you like my idea? actually, i have several others..."
57467,Marge,why? am i pregnant?
65246,Marge,don't talk to me like i'm a client!
57532,Marge,have you been drinking?
62361,Marge,i guess i'd better tell them i'm coming home.
56491,Marge,i hope you kept the homie fires burning...
57767,Marge,"no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
59803,Marge,"oh, homie. i knew you'd support me."
54595,Marge,"i'm sorry, i'm not ready to do that yet. i want to wait until i'm married, or at least really drunk."
66945,Marge,"two points. your turn, dear."
56789,Marge,that's mary had a little lamb.
67520,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. a heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try."
63960,Marge,"me neither, homie."
63685,Marge,"lisa, i'm sure this wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter."
59787,Marge,"no, ""smapron."""
55212,Marge,"children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. kids?"
63346,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, our marriage needs this bed."
57547,Marge,"i guess i'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of ""investing""..."
58572,Marge,"oh, homer, you're not going as a hobo again?"
66492,Marge,yes.
54951,Marge,"actually, i was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
62286,Marge,okay then. let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer.
55459,Marge,"no, homer. he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, lord. he just likes to sleep in on sundays..."
57745,Marge,"well, we wrecked the first dog. we've got to treat this one right. bart, why don't you take laddie for another walk."
57058,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
61508,Marge,"oh my god, what?"
63539,Marge,i promised that bank robber that i'd visit him in jail. but i just can't do it.
58601,Marge,this is such a secluded area. i wonder who lives in that house?
62556,Marge,no!
62549,Marge,she's not going to get over this quickly -- i know women.
59260,Marge,apu told me all eight babies have colic. although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
65160,Marge,you kids have had a big day. head up to the tub while i deflate your toys.
67883,Marge,"mr. burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl."
54793,Marge,four b.
65141,Marge,homie... you're paralyzed. but we love you and will never give up hope.
61892,Marge,"homer, that was for the dog."
60798,Marge,i need that tape!
57516,Marge,"don't ""soul mate"" me!"
60735,Marge,"ooo, look. there's your father."
65683,Marge,"also, i didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because i don't breastfeed!"
66726,Marge,what is that racket?
63008,Marge,"""wisconsin from above,"" ""veterans' day parades,"" ooh, ""smiles of ireland""! redheaded twins? their mother must have her hands full!"
58163,Marge,"now homer, listen, i've had enough! / in our family videos, we have plainly seen / you're a singing, dancing, entertainment machine!"
57186,Marge,why do you have to question everything i do?!!
64150,Marge,he's right here.
60352,Marge,this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
54632,Marge,"homie, i was so worried about you. i was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what i see most of the time. whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. together."
61542,Marge,"kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra."
60501,Marge,hamlet! what'd i tell you about running with swords?
59515,Marge,owww.
64578,Marge,"but you still have our passports, right?"
58146,Marge,"""...you'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. sincerely, moe."""
61309,Marge,yes.
63868,Marge,"i don't think i could. mr. leary, i'm so sorry. i'll send you your phone back right away."
63561,Marge,can you at least put it in your jacket?
60514,Marge,that's it. we're just going to have to pay for that call to brazil.
63444,Marge,find out if he has a wife! we could double date!
60093,Marge,george lazenby?
63724,Marge,"so, how was your outside time?"
66472,Marge,"homie, i love you. but you can be a challenge, like doing the daily jumble."
55516,Marge,oh...
61204,Marge,i don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
61195,Marge,"moe, i gotta handle this. can you keep an eye on maggie?"
65545,Marge,give back my baby!
57914,Marge,i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
65024,Marge,"homie, maybe you should stop. we've talked about the gray zone..."
63894,Marge,we were gone for two weeks!
58326,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie."
60438,Marge,it's only fair. we went to europe when lisa lost her balloon.
67289,Marge,these toys are just adorable. who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius?
63579,Marge,how could you not tell me you were an assassin?
60355,Marge,"and before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything i say."
62071,Marge,"i just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married."
63722,Marge,"i didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night..."
56634,Marge,"yes, homie?"
67068,Marge,it all seems so expensive...
56274,Marge,"this was a lovely idea, homie. come here and kiss me."
67479,Marge,here you go.
67278,Marge,"homer, i'd love a glass of that wine bart brought us."
63478,Marge,"aw, you're sweet."
62495,Marge,i was really looking forward to it.
65603,Marge,you were pocket-dialed!
62376,Marge,"okay. uh... you know, up close you're kinda cute."
56982,Marge,"do you see towels? if you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again."
62157,Marge,"we're not quite there yet, but we've opened up a dialogue!"
59519,Marge,"my goodness, what a lovely suit, sheriff. is that seersucker?"
58450,Marge,shh! they'll hear us.
56960,Marge,"why thank you, homie. you might say the extra ingredient is salt."
61013,Marge,we can't sell the house. we can't live here. what are we going to do?
60937,Marge,i really enjoyed your sermon. particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane fifteen.
58506,Marge,they're not very...
62610,Marge,christmas is a family day
62510,Marge,no.
58024,Marge,"how was your day, sweetheart?"
65513,Marge,it's about not agreeing on something.
54846,Marge,"i don't know, i thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
54880,Marge,oh my lord!
59988,Marge,let's just float by quietly...
62901,Marge,oh of course i do! that's why we're such a great team!
59020,Marge,give me my baby!
57594,Marge,"homie, maybe we should go inside."
62131,Marge,"oh please. from what i hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""google""-ing your own name until lunch."
58230,Marge,reverend lovejoy! you've got to help me! my entire family has been taken in by the evil movementarians.
59423,Marge,what floozies? what are you talking...
65095,Marge,"homer, stop him!"
62152,Marge,you don't take anything seriously. not even your bankruptcy hearing!
63631,Marge,i'm going to the successful ladies room!
67548,Marge,"for nonviolence, understanding and helping."""
57885,Marge,my next-door neighbor? religious guy?
58772,Marge,"aren't you coming, ed?"
61593,Marge,no.
56718,Marge,"oh, don't worry, honey. i guarantee your father will behave."
64064,Marge,"um... do you have time to look at a few other leaks, faulty wires and dangerous mold conditions?"
67876,Marge,"i'm painting his portrait, homer."
64865,Marge,"more oxycontin candy, sweetie?"
60965,Marge,here's five dollars. buy yourself a suit and get busy.
58862,Marge,"ooo, did i ever. and that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
59376,Marge,"stop that! cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like bill crosby and david letterson."
66013,Marge,"well, i'm glad your side of the deal worked out."
66557,Marge,awww.
59389,Marge,"bart, stop that! now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here."
62700,Marge,i'll help you.
60601,Marge,"oh. well, when homer does something wrong, i write a list of ways he can make it up to me. then i shred the list and put it in his food."
63847,Marge,oh my god! this is an erotic bakery!
54971,Marge,i don't know.
65821,Marge,now what are you doing?
56934,Marge,you mean maggie?
60881,Marge,i'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
61478,Marge,homer!
64635,Marge,and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time.
63080,Marge,"oh, you should be ashamed! your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
64323,Marge,"i can't back out, because if i fight him tomorrow...it'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future."
57901,Marge,those were the days.
59226,Marge,don't forget your mincemeat pie!
67062,Marge,"i'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game."
54777,Marge,"don't gloat, homer. you know, bart, when i was your age, the one thing i wanted more than anything in the world was a child-sized electric lightbulb oven. my parents wouldn't give me the money, so i went to my sisters, patty and selma..."
64464,Marge,"so bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
61552,Marge,"homie, you are so cute."
62135,Marge,"well i hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause i'm not speaking to you!"
65631,Marge,"grampa, we will never miss a visit again. and there'll be a lot more of them."
62022,Marge,who wants to help me clear the table?
64975,Marge,"odd, that's what the valet just asked me."
55956,Marge,"well, i do have a life outside this house, you know."
55962,Marge,that's one right there.
67857,Marge,i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust.
61007,Marge,there has to be a solution that pleases everyone. from ducks and trees to yous and mes.
62414,Marge,"lisa, honey. any chance you can stop reading soon?"
61551,Marge,"well, i've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay."
55861,Marge,$24.95!
64829,Marge,i'm so glad you two are friends again.
67122,Marge,"homer, we're having dinner tonight at the singing sirloin."
59305,Marge,homer!
66002,Marge,"you'll need your voice to say ""thanks, mom"" after your next recital!"
60808,Marge,"bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?"
66484,Marge,"oh, of course. you're right, honey. i'll just um, i'll park it at the bar."
55025,Marge,"i think about you, too."
65765,Marge,"i think it's time to go ""off family."""
65663,Marge,that's not applesauce...
66798,Marge,"chief, i hope this is the call i've been praying for."
59861,Marge,can you believe it? kent brockman playing on our court!
60861,Marge,"it looks like a purse, that's why i bought it, but it's really a--"
61863,Marge,"here, take this. my daughter didn't want the lunch i made."
55733,Marge,"homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you should throw it away."
59666,Marge,"all right, but this better be the best toilet paper i've ever had."
63703,Marge,"so that's the end of the story, huh?"
57661,Marge,not really. they just had corn on them. kitchen -- corn.
62142,Marge,this is a house!
62397,Marge,go back to your own country!
61011,Marge,but this is the east side.
54866,Marge,"bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
66993,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. sorry."
63589,Marge,"bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane!"
56972,Marge,"homer! just give him the donut. once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror."
57837,Marge,but don't you want to end world famine?
64737,Marge,i'd like to return this handbag. unused.
60305,Marge,hey!
58660,Marge,"it's so sweet of you to take us out like this, homie. come on, kids, three cheers for your father! hip hip--"
67582,Marge,huh huh.
62558,Marge,i read an article about it at the tire store. did you know it's not named after someone named wayne scott?
66425,Marge,all our friends are like that!
56202,Marge,"well, bart, your uncle arthur used to have a saying, ""shoot 'em all and let god sort 'em out."" unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. it took seventy-five federal marshals to bring him down. now, let's never speak of him again."
61112,Marge,"well, he's not yours anymore. you threw him out on christmas eve!"
55675,Marge,"wait, this might be the answer we're looking for."
62010,Marge,"goodnight, both of you."
65003,Marge,"um, hello... i'm marge simpson... i think i've given you money a of couple times..."
57199,Marge,you'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals.
65519,Marge,i never have any idea what to do for lisa. to be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument i don't really care for. it's so hard.
57620,Marge,i heard that!
57349,Marge,"i knew you'd do well, homer."
62723,Marge,you'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance.
66507,Marge,"here you go. put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher."
62820,Marge,"homer, what should we do?"
67468,Marge,homer!
61739,Marge,i swear bart didn't know what he was doing. he was deaf!
64491,Marge,"well, they should."
55064,Marge,homer?
67111,Marge,where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?
67161,Marge,no.
65964,Marge,grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to capital city.
63222,Marge,"""dingle's berries"" in provo, utah?"
57388,Marge,what are you doing in the basement? it's like you're hiding out down here.
66512,Marge,keep it! let's go!
67563,Marge,what do we want?
63766,Marge,"hello, are you royce lumpkin?"
54963,Marge,"no, bart. no one's going to make her. this is something lisa has to decide for herself."
66760,Marge,"well, he's not in the neon sign store."
58503,Marge,that's every woman's nightmare.
61356,Marge,"attention, everyone."
59598,Marge,i thought you said the law was powerless.
62831,Marge,there. you're the perfect little he-she.
55942,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
56768,Marge,"hello class. hi bart. over here, sweetie. it's me, mom. hi. hey. hello."
66391,Marge,you're both coming home with us!
62346,Marge,why would we want to go to santa's village? it's august.
55062,Marge,i heard a noise outside and thought it might be homer.
67100,Marge,"yeah. sit down, homer."
60980,Marge,he's adorable! i'd sure like to tuck that in at night.
66844,Marge,you're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? how much have you had?
58355,Marge,"it's the same basic bear, homey."
63099,Marge,the show starts at three. you promise you'll be here?
60534,Marge,everything here is something.
61055,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
63715,Marge,homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
57999,Marge,sounds like you need some first aid.
66867,Marge,"really? awag? really? well, if you think tha--"
63323,Marge,"well, he's done very well for someone who came out blue and backwards."
58159,Marge,what did you get?
59337,Marge,i couldn't sleep knowing that window had a smudge on it.
61803,Marge,"great stuff, ned."
67243,Marge,"oh, homer. how many times do i have to fluff your pillow?"
57128,Marge,"who's ""disco stu?"""
58636,Marge,"oh my, you're burning up. i'm going to tell the school you're staying home."
67130,Marge,"you bought that bowling ball for you, not for me."
67000,Marge,they're having a conversation. they actually enjoy talking to each other.
56966,Marge,"sorry, force of habit. lisa, no!"
66723,Marge,you got very lucky this time. don't push it.
63672,Marge,"homie, this is your party!"
59875,Marge,"no, it's a smooth motion... you follow through with your racket."
64102,Marge,uh-oh. we're starting to attract swingers.
60736,Marge,"well, i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it."
66159,Marge,"i have no regrets about that. it was a perfect pregnancy. didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. and every night before bed, homer would give me a little kiss... music. could bart have been prenatally screwed up by the kiss music?"
56787,Marge,"what do you do, follow my husband around?"
60092,Marge,murder-suicides.
63598,Marge,no peeking. i'm wai-ting.
60483,Marge,it's been so many years since i've seen your father. i hope he's still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.
61497,Marge,"sweetie, you seem so blue. did the last of something die?"
56447,Marge,"bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
66443,Marge,that picture has brought out the worst in everyone! please... just let it go!
57451,Marge,maybe we should all have a few drinks.
63303,Marge,okay... activate my level seven power stones... wield the orb of oblivion... and zap!
67951,Marge,the biggest change for me over the last eight years? that's gotta be homer!
60074,Marge,"grampa, we've been married for years. when are you gonna put down that gun?"
58197,Marge,"good one, spud."
57782,Marge,homer! will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? it came from the dump.
55978,Marge,i'm not sure.
66052,Marge,so many unhappy men. how sad.
67283,Marge,"oh, eight carousels. we're in for a real treat!"
61898,Marge,evergreen terrace.
61413,Marge,...she had married a brute.
66332,Marge,"ooo... so many choices, maggie."
58001,Marge,i was thinking more like protection for... down there.
55185,Marge,"no, you're not. when my father got out of the navy, he used to curse a blue streak. it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. so, my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen. every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. what do you think?"
63575,Marge,uh... a blender cozy.
56105,Marge,"if he wants to make it up to you so badly, i think you should let him."
57257,Marge,"hello? no, bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to amsterdam!"
58067,Marge,"oh boy, i've got a lot to learn before that license test."
60243,Marge,time to begin operation xmas-remind of-how good is.
63184,Marge,what a great day.
57108,Marge,"homie, you want pork chops?"
61550,Marge,"homie, to store the extra wine we bought, i made a little wine cellar."
65385,Marge,what's going on?
55085,Marge,"testing... testing... one, two, three... oh, my. do i sound like that?"
60552,Marge,"honey, i like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. hang on, i've got call waiting."
64321,Marge,is there someone in there?
54775,Marge,ohhh.
59559,Marge,"let's see. candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
55853,Marge,"mm-hm, if you'd like to learn more about colonial times we could take a field trip to old springfield towne."
55155,Marge,thanks again for taking the children while i'm away.
67363,Marge,homer!
66616,Marge,no lawsuit! you're hired!
60058,Marge,i contributed by not objecting too much.
63204,Marge,you killed my husband!
58939,Marge,ring the bell!
56799,Marge,"uh, i must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. wee-aah!"
57238,Marge,"patty! go on, selma, tell me more."
60529,Marge,homer!
63557,Marge,"dwight, please, don't do anything crazy."
55926,Marge,come on dear. it's time to go.
55642,Marge,what's that stench?
61850,Marge,"i told him to use a land line. okay gang, let's get this party started -- or should i say barted?"
57170,Marge,"i don't know. lisa, tonight is very important. mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
62750,Marge,no!
64238,Marge,"no, a husband!"
63231,Marge,what do you want?
67949,Marge,as best you could.
56963,Marge,you don't win friends with sal-ad / you don't win friends with sal-ad...
62446,Marge,"homer, you're crazy!"
57422,Marge,"here i come, everybody!"
67195,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
57401,Marge,"now, the cat needs his medication every morning --"
65600,Marge,"so, you don't want another baby? how long have you felt this way?"
55806,Marge,that doesn't sound like they like you at all.
67198,Marge,really!?
56139,Marge,"oooh, the walls are melting again."
60572,Marge,did it again!
59560,Marge,"oh, becky, you look beautiful. i thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. it's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. all ""don'ts."""
61962,Marge,"now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage."
59607,Marge,i really should read the whole headline before i react.
64372,Marge,no!
59320,Marge,go! go!
65267,Marge,i just got a message from maggie in my brain.
65772,Marge,"so, surfing is really your job?"
57164,Marge,"oh, don't thank me. thank my beautiful new suit."
67612,Marge,"well, maybe lisa does have a point. i don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't bart have to tell the truth?"
66139,Marge,who are you talking to?
54806,Marge,"you're still angry, homer. why don't you sleep on it?"
59774,Marge,"well, maybe if you ate some meat you'd have a natural lubricant! you lost all our money?"
55913,Marge,"homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
55825,Marge,you lost five percent of your brain.
65691,Marge,i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids... except lisa. i breastfed lisa for nine months.
64785,Marge,i can't live with the guilt.
63630,Marge,what's gotten into you?
55777,Marge,i want you to give up beer for a month.
60862,Marge,"look, this really made me feel vulnerable. i want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
57533,Marge,more sausage?
65209,Marge,don't you judge me.
62573,Marge,"tammy, i'd never have had the courage to skydive if it weren't for you girls."
56142,Marge,are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
58905,Marge,"hm. well, i guess we both learned a lesson. but if anybody asks, you hit him."
56815,Marge,i suppose i would.
60562,Marge,"or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
65265,Marge,just look happy!
64502,Marge,"i'm not horny, i'm mad."
60148,Marge,and help me with this banner.
56474,Marge,"homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
63691,Marge,"anyway, i was growing to admire my professor more and more..."
58475,Marge,"homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight."
62140,Marge,homer!
59790,Marge,there's so much evil in the world.
58187,Marge,but when we ask you to do yardwork...
55922,Marge,what? homie!
56853,Marge,i don't think that's a very good idea.
61246,Marge,where did you get that tutu?
63662,Marge,"homer, your behavior is heinous."
56535,Marge,"judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
58532,Marge,"he didn't go to nelson's, did he?"
59306,Marge,no!
64791,Marge,i know where we are! this is the neighborhood where i grew up!
66754,Marge,i've gotta call homer.
67174,Marge,it's a very challenging hobby.
63013,Marge,"let's see what you've got... peanut butter and jelly sandwich, trail mix -- starring peanuts, good grief! more peanuts!"
67486,Marge,lisa! my goodness! that's very impressive!
57913,Marge,homer stop! would you please look at the drawing?
64941,Marge,um... well... of course you did!
55981,Marge,you look... nice.
63172,Marge,where's maggie?
54941,Marge,that's no reason to buy a pony!
61193,Marge,"no, no all that's in there is love and gratitude."
63089,Marge,"noooo! i mean, yes!"
59117,Marge,"oh sorry, honey, i used up the last roll on that man i thought was judge judy."
63205,Marge,we were together for five years! now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
61015,Marge,quick! someone perform cpr.
65122,Marge,did you have a hard day too?
56416,Marge,homer!
64631,Marge,i don't see what's so wonderful.
66169,Marge,it's all my fault. i should never have listened to those kiss albums when i was pregnant.
63359,Marge,where's your father with those pacifiers?
67649,Marge,"please, homer. can't we try it?"
64807,Marge,what's so wrong with me?
62155,Marge,"oh, i've lost them! i can't see past all the suvs!"
63664,Marge,"milhouse, have you seen bart?"
63956,Marge,don't be silly. our marriage can weather any storm -- just like this tree.
62502,Marge,"well, i hope neil young will remember..."
65014,Marge,i can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
65365,Marge,look! a shooting star!
60983,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
62092,Marge,"go, go, go!"
58036,Marge,"ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! they say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
54658,Marge,homer! dr. hibbert told you to eat healthier!
59504,Marge,homer no. you'll kill us all.
59101,Marge,it's not boring. he's passionate about government.
54885,Marge,"how are you enjoying your ham, homie?"
61974,Marge,"come on, go home."
59970,Marge,most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well.
54966,Marge,"what's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
58988,Marge,you don't understand.
63387,Marge,he just needs it for walking upstairs.
57819,Marge,"you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be there, aren't you?"
63893,Marge,thank god you're okay!
66978,Marge,"well, everything. your dip sign, for instance. now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road."
65956,Marge,it's not what you think!
55098,Marge,"sting, you look tired. maybe you should take a rest."
62967,Marge,"one more crack out of you, young man, and i'm showing everyone your baby pictures."
57905,Marge,it's a shame what school can do.
58891,Marge,maggie?!
63328,Marge,don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
63885,Marge,pull over -- bart's in this field!
56328,Marge,but...
55311,Marge,"okay, we've got cocktail wienies and swedish meatballs."
64298,Marge,uh-huh...
63461,Marge,bodacious frittatas? buffet the hunger slayer?
61177,Marge,our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded native american. say hello to jim proudfoot from the mohican tribe.
60777,Marge,"i finally feel like me again. you're not disappointed, are you?"
57408,Marge,"what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?"
62068,Marge,whoa! save something for your wedding night.
64124,Marge,"oh yes, homer! yes!"
56032,Marge,"i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
66405,Marge,"ooh, what's your hurry?"
66318,Marge,"bart, your school requires you to give everyone a valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
59128,Marge,it's what i do.
59740,Marge,see? the ladies know what i'm talkin' about.
57575,Marge,"oh, no! no! don't do that! you're supposed to be tasting them!"
58315,Marge,"oh, you mean like the ""a"" students?"
67881,Marge,"i'm so sorry, mr. burns."
62075,Marge,no! i can't let this happen!
66511,Marge,i was making that cake for the block party today! now there's no choice but to go... store-bought!
66047,Marge,"okay, i've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!"
63655,Marge,"i'm honoring america's advertisers. then we're going to buy some toothpaste, lease a new car, and vote ""yes"" on prop eighty-seven."
58705,Marge,"you mean, you've never splurged and, say, eaten an entire birthday cake, then blamed it on the dog?"
57732,Marge,"homer, bart's up there!"
58032,Marge,"i've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. i've got the extra wine glasses, but i'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
59719,Marge,but i do feel bad about the starving children...
57266,Marge,but where are we going to put him?
58368,Marge,you've signed my name lots of times.
61924,Marge,"not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances. do ya? huh, do ya?"
55151,Marge,i need to unwind.
59387,Marge,the boat's going sideways!
56534,Marge,i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. they've been living in sin.
57877,Marge,you better start saving now. it's very expensive.
66453,Marge,"you know, you're pretty rude."
54698,Marge,should i forgive him?...
66042,Marge,"let's just enjoy our happiness, homie. accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman. and i think bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior."
63121,Marge,homie...
67462,Marge,the father of the loser mows the lawn -- 
58916,Marge,"yeah, c'mon homie!"
59997,Marge,"don't worry, doctor. we'll get you all the help you need."
58921,Marge,"lisa, we got another postcard from your father!"
62332,Marge,"well then, i'd like to speak with jesus."
67247,Marge,"homer, principal skinner's here."
57432,Marge,you're talking about a trough! we're not going to eat from a trough! and another thing -- it's only 5:15. why are you in your underwear?
59477,Marge,"well, you still have lenny and carl."
67244,Marge,well... okay.
60418,Marge,but i can explain!
55968,Marge,"well, thank you for a lovely time."
67519,Marge,"homer, you're his father. you've got to try and reason with him."
65532,Marge,la-dies-and-gen-tle-men-i-have-an-an-nounce-ment. that's not iambic pentameter!
67265,Marge,lisa!
58461,Marge,got 'em.
65427,Marge,"he exercises so much, but he looks the same. i guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future."
54916,Marge,"homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say."
58979,Marge,"you, an artist?"
62557,Marge,this house has such beautiful wainscoting.
61805,Marge,"bart, can you come in here for a second?"
54837,Marge,you've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
62038,Marge,"don't argue with marge, i know what's best / the only rap in this crib, keeps sandwiches fresh!"
60879,Marge,twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
67631,Marge,um-hmm.
56772,Marge,exhausting. it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map.
63194,Marge,"ooo, now that's smooth."
67632,Marge,"homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
58674,Marge,"oh, homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it."
59247,Marge,"these swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. i mean, a green table! i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams."
66262,Marge,"homer simpson! ask yourself -- ""w.w.b.j.d.?"""
66156,Marge,poor chip. such a big part of everyone's life.
55353,Marge,there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about...
56443,Marge,"time for church, bart. i bet your little friend jessica will be there."
65354,Marge,if i may speak.
59789,Marge,i'm a little disappointed. there were too many aprons.
64216,Marge,"ooh, i'm doing it!"
60956,Marge,"bart, you're suing us?!"
61852,Marge,"gee, i did the best i could..."
58189,Marge,you had a quadruple bypass. you nearly died. don't you remember?
64573,Marge,"this country's so historic -- for all we know, jesus could have given a talk in conference room c."
57807,Marge,"swipe at the dominant male! c'mon, ned, knock that monkey down!"
61325,Marge,you've made that promise before.
57353,Marge,well explain to me why it isn't.
58561,Marge,not as hard as you think.
56488,Marge,"look, maybe this whole thing will blow over."
60110,Marge,"homer! homer, you're alive!"
65618,Marge,spiro's...
55153,Marge,"no homie, no. i still love you. a lot of couples take separate vacations."
66608,Marge,i'm in.
61726,Marge,i wish there was some way i could believe that.
61547,Marge,"mmm, it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on!"
67945,Marge,"thank you, bart -- this frame grab's going on my coffee cup."
65120,Marge,"kids, enjoy your extreme snack!"
63999,Marge,"great! here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--"
63221,Marge,"okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. in colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum."
67761,Marge,"homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?"
56744,Marge,bart! don't ever say that word again!
67841,Marge,"well, i think we better set an example."
56167,Marge,"ew, homer, there is a bird on your head?"
61533,Marge,i never want you in this house again!
58060,Marge,i found this hat!
61208,Marge,maggie's gone!
65146,Marge,wanna go home and celebrate?
59491,Marge,"okay honey, we're almost to palm corners. there'll be nothing to do but lie on the beach and relax."
62467,Marge,a robot?
62355,Marge,all right.
59278,Marge,"""her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."""
55104,Marge,"hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. i do it all the time. i pretend i'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things i'll tell you about when you're older. do you understand?"
56348,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
65656,Marge,no idea. the important thing is that they did.
58374,Marge,i can't believe it's come to this.
59844,Marge,so you really didn't do it?
64090,Marge,give me my baby back!
65961,Marge,"no, no, it has to be something big that'll change his whole outlook. why don't we take moe on a road trip?"
61640,Marge,"all right, kids, you don't have to go. but i insist we do something tonight as a family. we'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
65932,Marge,how did we get bedbugs?
65153,Marge,they're all pretty big...
67515,Marge,what a fun-filled evening.
55834,Marge,"that was ""happy days."""
61752,Marge,"homer, we've got to get outta here."
59478,Marge,"well, if barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. old friends stick together, like o.j. and a.c., or the falcon and the snowman."
65472,Marge,not in the mood.
58204,Marge,i found some food for breakfast. i hope everyone likes the red things that grow on this tree.
57941,Marge,"homer, no!"
64416,Marge,which position should we try?
63057,Marge,"homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home."
66060,Marge,he forgot our anniversary again? he remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
67755,Marge,"are you sure you want to do this, homer? it doesn't look friendly."
54717,Marge,"man, things sure have turned to crap."
55668,Marge,"hello?... yes... oh, dear lord! homer's in the hospital! they think it's his heart."
67788,Marge,"oh for god's sakes, homer, it's an empty threat."
57111,Marge,it's sick! and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. like mr. burns.
57849,Marge,"well, it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the middle of the semester."
59090,Marge,"well, that shut me up."
61100,Marge,you're tellin' me.
65900,Marge,in-ground?
63642,Marge,okay.
57705,Marge,"oooh, malaria zone! that's where all the explorers shop."
67780,Marge,"homer, my sister is not going out with barney gumbel."
67609,Marge,oh!
57439,Marge,"i don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
63422,Marge,marge takes off in a sprint .
60019,Marge,"homer, help!"
63143,Marge,"it's true -- i do have trouble saying ""no."" it all started when i was seven..."
66188,Marge,that's even worse. could you say it one more time?
66559,Marge,the city's broke. the fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
65156,Marge,"aren't you gonna come to bed, homie?"
58213,Marge,"homer, no!"
55647,Marge,"oh, honey... honey... honey... honey. could you please be quiet?"
62416,Marge,"frankly, no. lisa kind of took care of herself. our oldest, bart, was such a handful."
58583,Marge,"oh, lord. i was hoping this day would never come."
60032,Marge,bart!!!
65818,Marge,mm-hmm!
57720,Marge,beer!
60257,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're back."
60037,Marge,except your thumb! and lisa's science project!
64217,Marge,definitely a cup.
55690,Marge,many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
64500,Marge,yes it will. i'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. because without homer i'm a broom without a stone. no use for anything.
65419,Marge,suzette!
57823,Marge,just a little more... then he won't have any reason to resent you.
65575,Marge,"all right, i remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. i mean, i don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. with this car, we're basically saying no more babies!"
64750,Marge,"brother bear said ""sister bear is inconsiderate."""
60899,Marge,"ruth powers, my old neighbor? oh, my goodness, look at you!"
62946,Marge,"uh, let's see here... ooh, here's something the book's previous owner underlined! ""be honest with your partner about what you're feeling."""
67154,Marge,no.
64646,Marge,i'm still mad at you from last night.
60310,Marge,"that company's ruining the whole town's health, and i don't know how to stop them."
57182,Marge,the outlet store.
54761,Marge,yes.
60179,Marge,watch what happens when i spill this blue liquid.
58540,Marge,bart! did you kill that poor bird?
60638,Marge,"we appreciate your coming to comfort us, but we're not catholic."
62235,Marge,you have to understand -- ray doesn't exist.
56090,Marge,and don't take candy from strangers.
59349,Marge,"okay, okay calm down. they couldn't have gone too far."
57545,Marge,"well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. i'm proud of you, homie."
55936,Marge,gimme that.
66631,Marge,you are working two jobs!
57613,Marge,"homie, i'm losing my hair."
58372,Marge,"i'll have to say drugs, too."
60476,Marge,so you've settled for branson.
65549,Marge,"i'll tell you what i'm doing, i'm realizing that i married the wrong man. oh, you poor, sweet, simple homers."
60399,Marge,homie!
65899,Marge,i'm not going to sleep!
56939,Marge,"the only thing i'm high on is love. love for my son and daughters. yes, a little ""l.s.d."" is all i need."
60251,Marge,oh no! our daughter's run away on christmas eve.
65905,Marge,i'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
57654,Marge,"i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
57490,Marge,remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. it just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
55035,Marge,so you've ruined your life.
55760,Marge,"ah, thank you, dear."
67555,Marge,the answer is all around you.
59264,Marge,"well, you don't have to be sarcastic."
56999,Marge,con: you're setting a bad example for the children.
63433,Marge,which one?
66466,Marge,"oh, there's my magazine. why, look at this! ""what every father should do for his daughter."""
63344,Marge,"homer, stop that."
56493,Marge,homer! homie! the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
61965,Marge,what's going on here?
67610,Marge,homer!
63731,Marge,"aw marge, if there was a reality show called ""fat guys who really love their wives"", not only would it be an enormous ratings success, but i'd be the first one on it."
55388,Marge,"she complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave."
62620,Marge,tire spikes?
61147,Marge,what? that's crazy.
55225,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you at band practice?"
55013,Marge,"bart, i want you to go down to moe's tavern. i need you to bring your father home."
67200,Marge,thank you.
67611,Marge,"that's right, he did. excuse me, but dr. hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought bart was fine."
54768,Marge,all this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
54682,Marge,"choose me because i'm not bitter yet, i can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time."
58391,Marge,is that your wallet?
54770,Marge,"ohhh, homer."
57511,Marge,you promised you wouldn't drink!
60038,Marge,"boy, this sure was one crazy day...right, mr. teeny?"
54857,Marge,"he's trying to be friendly. you know, if you gave ned flanders a chance --"
64882,Marge,but i was gonna-- oooh!
61834,Marge,she's already ahead of me.
56284,Marge,but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
63487,Marge,"i'm so tense, i can't enjoy count almaviva serenading the intended bride of dr. bartolo. i just can't."
54967,Marge,ed asner?
55135,Marge,one at a time! one at a time!
54603,Marge,"professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the third world?"
66684,Marge,is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes?
67190,Marge,"oh. well, thank you."
67813,Marge,"oh yes, you do. you just don't know it. the memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins."
58377,Marge,"anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
58195,Marge,"so mr. cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry?"
67297,Marge,"oh. okay, well thank you."
56309,Marge,even on our jobs...
64891,Marge,i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is!
57627,Marge,"shary bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
66125,Marge,why didn't you call us?
65477,Marge,homie's been working so hard i thought i'd bring him a special lunch.
62880,Marge,no! and i hope i never do! the best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!
54931,Marge,that's a long shot.
66843,Marge,homie! are you dressed? you have soccer setup in twenty minutes! homie?!
64013,Marge,"lisa ran away, and it's all my fault! if i'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything would've been fine."
60875,Marge,"two, three, two..."
60912,Marge,let's do it!
54891,Marge,"look, i know bart can be a handful but i also know what he's like inside. he's got a spark. it's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
56584,Marge,i meant our wedding rings.
59467,Marge,i don't remember the air in the kitchen being so wavy. good lord - that's gas!
67592,Marge,i didn't really expect things to change this much.
64985,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. you'll get your chance to say ridiculous things."
64349,Marge,it tastes like... cuddling! / it tastes like clean clothes!
61894,Marge,this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose.
56424,Marge,no answer.
67771,Marge,she's the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
66123,Marge,please. i need people here who are helpful and sensitive.
65248,Marge,homer! are you... schmoozing those men?
58957,Marge,please stop eating that. god's gonna furious.
55108,Marge,oh really?
64547,Marge,"i just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize."
58762,Marge,who's trent steel?
59600,Marge,yes.
66166,Marge,"anything from ""love gun""!"
59184,Marge,"remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite!"
63827,Marge,"excuse me, i think i'm holding up better than you are. in fact, i've got energy to spare."
63266,Marge,restage the photos?
57697,Marge,"uh, grampa's not coming..."
56641,Marge,"no, no, no, no! i'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with australia! you'll just have to find some other country to have relations with."
54722,Marge,"lisa, tell your father."
66064,Marge,"i am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
66570,Marge,well... it could be worse.
60009,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm so sorry!
65015,Marge,what are you talking about?
67745,Marge,what? whadda ya mean?
58865,Marge,"oh, for crying out loud... i--"
64986,Marge,"thanks, rollin' eighties."
66490,Marge,you're alive! but how?
62296,Marge,"we're not going anywhere, except to bed!"
54700,Marge,"with his marriage in this much trouble, he's got a lot of thinking to do."
66269,Marge,"enough! stop! christmas carols only have one verse! well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
66196,Marge,homer!
65292,Marge,"homie, i love you, and i'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world..."
58971,Marge,"oh, right. the sins."
62461,Marge,homer! i can save you both! just let go of the rock!
57646,Marge,i'm so glad you could join us for homer's big premiere.
60887,Marge,why did homer buy those? no one's ever gonna use 'em.
57566,Marge,welcome to pretzel wagon. may i take your order?
55769,Marge,oh my god. he's dead?
58018,Marge,poor barney.
54853,Marge,"lisa, what's gotten into you?"
65854,Marge,i so wanted him to be gay.
58153,Marge,"look, i know this has been a stressful holiday. but, in a way, having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are."
67794,Marge,"actually, i just told you pretty much everything."
65450,Marge,and i sold our good china.
65086,Marge,you can start with the rinse!
55421,Marge,i just don't see what's so bad about stanley.
54622,Marge,i'm getting you off this stuff.
66627,Marge,i'm sorry.
59299,Marge,that's right. and what else have we learned?
55492,Marge,single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. must like monkeys. non-smoker preferred.
62474,Marge,you told me he was at culinary school!
64670,Marge,"but that's impossible! if you're the real walt warren, who's taking our son to the baseball game right now?"
64833,Marge,they have a vaccine!
58892,Marge,ooh...
58727,Marge,"you really should have voted, homer."
66730,Marge,i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.
61801,Marge,"when virginia woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
56116,Marge,how did it go?
54685,Marge,everything's fine! cupcakes and sprinkles!
63908,Marge,i just did.
67614,Marge,goodness!
59733,Marge,i'll do it. i always end up doing it.
58429,Marge,"oh, yeah. he's really special."
65193,Marge,what are you doing?
66883,Marge,"ok, mel. i'll be at the casino by ten. meet me at the lounge by the j. geils cover band."
64621,Marge,tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said.
60015,Marge,"arrest me?! um, my address, it's, um... 1-2-3... fake street."
60090,Marge,"hi, ultrahouse."
65322,Marge,"homie, read this."
59163,Marge,who wants pork chops?
62184,Marge,"oh, you must be michael's dad!"
64333,Marge,"no. let's go home. we can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
63441,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
55105,Marge,bart!
55049,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i said that this is how i pictured my wedding day... but you are how i pictured my husband."
66463,Marge,quit comparing me to ben chapman!
59625,Marge,... and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee.
59613,Marge,"ooboy, my bad. becky, i'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family."
55576,Marge,oh my goodness!
66222,Marge,that is pretty good.
62604,Marge,"boy, that sideshow bob goes from zero to murder awfully fast."
57981,Marge,"how could you?! of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable..."
60696,Marge,house of pain. this must be where you pay the bill. why am i always so funny when no one's around?
55136,Marge,that's enough!
61961,Marge,"well, the drug company won't do anything to help us."
56846,Marge,you have to move your car.
60561,Marge,"don't worry, homer. you don't need mary jane to laugh at mr. burns' jokes. just picture him naked."
56800,Marge,see?...
59110,Marge,"look, they're making a movie! robert downey, jr. is shooting it out with the police!"
56803,Marge,"lisa, unhand your brother."
60424,Marge,does that work on anyone?
66580,Marge,oh it!
56814,Marge,"oh, homie, of course i will."
60791,Marge,thanks for letting us stay with you.
63043,Marge,i'm gonna go look at the new babies.
56712,Marge,"homie, you voted for the right movie. i'm glad you were on the jury."
59659,Marge,"geez, so many dolphins..."
59489,Marge,aww. he can crawl up through my toilet any day.
56198,Marge,the dog has had enough excitement.
55902,Marge,"homer, where's the dog?"
64367,Marge,whoops!
63632,Marge,"homie, i'm back!"
67176,Marge,"well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?"
65325,Marge,"...i want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. don't worry about me, i'll be fine."
58203,Marge,what's going on?
63106,Marge,"no, homer. it's you. my sweet, perfectly imperfect you."
56124,Marge,"honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? the keebler people were very upset..."
57652,Marge,"oh, then i guess this is goodbye, roy. maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
57176,Marge,i need a formal dress for tonight!
60600,Marge,all right! girls night out! exotic male dancers at the golden banana!
65133,Marge,how about living on a train that's always moving?
59665,Marge,out-of-towner tax?!
63453,Marge,there's only one man who could help us now.
64780,Marge,low sodium!
55996,Marge,there's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
57473,Marge,what a wonderful evening! a magical way for two people to renew their love.
67377,Marge,evil!
62861,Marge,lisa! my little know-it-all!
57508,Marge,"thank you for your concern, helen. homer isn't drinking today."
55622,Marge,"hmmm, i don't think so. oh, maggie, when are you going to talk?"
57856,Marge,"well, he's got more confidence!"
56974,Marge,these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! and you kids should have jackets on.
59626,Marge,"i learned something: when people reach for their diaphragm, they don't want to see my picture."
66741,Marge,wish homer was here.
56457,Marge,"bart, i can spend some time with you."
61127,Marge,"well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so i can reach you."
61321,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you? christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself."
61028,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry... you know i usually bring my a-game to the bedroom... but tonight i just can't throw the heat."
64254,Marge,tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... dr. hibbert as banquo?!
64280,Marge,no. i lost.
63015,Marge,don't you have any follow-through on anything?
63515,Marge,"at least you need me, sack of potatoes."
58046,Marge,well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
57736,Marge,"... bills, bills... oh a rejection letter from the new yorker subscription department... hmm. who or what is ""santos l. halper?"""
59603,Marge,"oh, yes. he's kind of everywhere."
60703,Marge,"oh, you big fooler. pretending not to remember so you could surprise us."
58152,Marge,good lord!
64303,Marge,this goes on for a while...
61912,Marge,together we broke the biggest story of the semester -- one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup.
64111,Marge,"they say if you kiss the blarney stone, you get ""the gift of gab."" which is great, but i'm not sure i like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. what kind of a message is that for lisa and maggie? those are my daughters. but on the other hand, america doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for stone phillips. do you have one of him here? if so, he's our your him."
61426,Marge,well?
58542,Marge,"what's the point, bart? i punish and i punish and i punish, but it never sinks in. so you know what? do what you want. you want to play with little hoodlums? fine. have fun killing things."
66561,Marge,the water's gonna get cold!
63238,Marge,nothing like reading a well-plotted mystery on the beach. it's amazing how they always solve the crime just before they run out of pages.
64072,Marge,"homie, i think it's an eviction notice. we're gonna be homeless, like lucille ball in ""the stone pillow""!"
65960,Marge,that poor man. we've got to do something to change his life.
57556,Marge,edna.
64453,Marge,"did i hear ""lettuce?"""
55720,Marge,"homer, that's very rude of you."
55007,Marge,"well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
59978,Marge,nobody's a warthog.
58510,Marge,it could save lives!
63659,Marge,that's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
66919,Marge,"well, homer and i are looking forward to your visit, too."
67930,Marge,"wow -- it's like a renaissance fair, but without all the chubby couples!"
64855,Marge,"homie, why don't you study these?"
63939,Marge,i'm just happy you're talking again. you didn't say a word for forty-five minutes.
60512,Marge,"we're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service."
64503,Marge,"i should be, i'm left-handed. i've been using my right hand all these years 'cause i didn't want to seem unusual in any way."
64656,Marge,why on earth do you think that harmless-looking man...is sideshow bob?
58364,Marge,go! go! go!
67311,Marge,"well, tonight is a very special night. your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing."
65747,Marge,"all right, but i'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid."
63869,Marge,"of course, you're denis leary!"
65988,Marge,"let's go, bart..."
64658,Marge,"or lieutenant commander tom dodge in ""down periscope."""
58856,Marge,i'm almost done. and tell bart to get out of my purse.
56352,Marge,i give up. did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
63249,Marge,shut up! it's an instructional website! shut up!
60581,Marge,apu is having an affair?!
62231,Marge,"homer, come down for dinner."
58202,Marge,"hey, someone's boarded up our windows!"
56598,Marge,"oh no, no. n-not exactly. it's just that i haven't told homer yet; and with his new job, i don't know how we're going to be able to afford this."
62567,Marge,what are you doing today?
54792,Marge,a mother knows everything about her family.
66338,Marge,"i hate when i come here and the first word out of my mouth is homer. but here we go. again. homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
59166,Marge,"oh, yeah? what's a palate?"
57961,Marge,candied apple!
65176,Marge,"ooo, let's see what else they do wrong!"
65397,Marge,what do you see?
62432,Marge,"no!!! here, here play with your teddy bear."
65698,Marge,"the animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon."
58697,Marge,homer!
58996,Marge,any ideas yet?
62843,Marge,that's her! don't answer it yet! i don't want that judgmental bitch in my house!
57102,Marge,"oh, bart. i can't believe you did this."
65022,Marge,"homer, the game is right here!"
60204,Marge,it would be a good excuse to use my yaqui tea set...
63779,Marge,"yes! it's time for you to take control of your own destiny. you're not a doormat, you're a door prize!"
59893,Marge,"look, we're all trying to have dinner. so why don't we just... psych! psych! psych!"
57808,Marge,you've got to get him out of there!
55188,Marge,"yes, homer."
63522,Marge,homie! you're all right!
55673,Marge,no. don't you have health insurance at work?
62650,Marge,that was yesterday.
59070,Marge,"come on, homer, japan will be fun. you liked ""rashomon."""
63862,Marge,that laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. bart! how did you get a cell phone?
54681,Marge,she doesn't know what a good thing she's got. i like a man who can relax. not like grumpy-lumpy there.
58229,Marge,"i'm leaving this place, and you'd better step aside!"
59698,Marge,they've undergone terrible hardships.
56306,Marge,"yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy? children, your father and i have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. it's time to learn about love."
64380,Marge,"well, i brought a few items to make our night extra-special. massage oil..."
63069,Marge,"kids, grab a fold."
65586,Marge,"i guess... that's that, then."
64521,Marge,it was a footnote. see?
54755,Marge,"oh, homer."
57561,Marge,"your franchise, how much?"
65476,Marge,i have to take maggie for her checkup. and a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
63668,Marge,this magic marker's running out of ink.
54714,Marge,"gosh, what a hunk!"
59355,Marge,you college boys are only interested in one thing.
61972,Marge,i'm here protecting our investment. i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
55726,Marge,mr. hutz!
64271,Marge,maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. and i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm her mother.
64992,Marge,at least no one else has taken this drug.
58928,Marge,"yes, that's it! lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman!"
64482,Marge,i've been training all my life. i once swept red wine off a white carpet.
62161,Marge,"three hundred cans of budget club mushroom soup! if you have some noodles and tuna fish, you could make a casserole that's small on price, but big on flavor."
66654,Marge,"if you'll just give me back my original investment, i'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries."
61492,Marge,"maggie, i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over!"
57681,Marge,"what? you never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
60069,Marge,"you can do it, paul."
62712,Marge,i didn't say that.
61066,Marge,"homer, let it go. it's not always going to be perfect. we've been married for ten years."
55457,Marge,"i can't believe you're giving up church, homer."
62264,Marge,to give these germans das boot? jawohl!
60707,Marge,get in.
66704,Marge,"well, if he's gonna get a haircut, bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it."
62046,Marge,please give me back my boy! i just want to tell him i love him one more time.
56616,Marge,that's what really happened.
64830,Marge,homer? how did you get...?
58589,Marge,really? that seemed awfully quick.
55624,Marge,"uh, well..."
59348,Marge,"hansen's disease. you know, like that horrible cream soda?"
59374,Marge,"hmm, i know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
58661,Marge,hip hip--
57437,Marge,"homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
60343,Marge,it seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools.
61427,Marge,did you read the book?
58498,Marge,"homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer."
62422,Marge,homer!
60005,Marge,you can't have a brownie. period.
55008,Marge,"now, bart, lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. we all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
65789,Marge,"homer, listen to the g.p.s."
67617,Marge,"homer, what's happened to you? all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
65219,Marge,this is nice -- a family fun day!
55301,Marge,always has been.
64873,Marge,even mac davis himself couldn't save this christmas.
66422,Marge,"wow, the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them."
54924,Marge,"my goodness, what's wrong?"
61364,Marge,that ad makes me look like a criminal.
59453,Marge,not half as good as cyberfudge.
56400,Marge,i have nothing to say to you.
67381,Marge,"i'm in the kitchen, homer!"
65762,Marge,there's really only one choice. or should i say two identical choices?
64508,Marge,homer!
62852,Marge,"oh, you seem sweet, but i could never have a favorite."
67517,Marge,are you all right?
65829,Marge,do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldn't take her to?
62715,Marge,"lookin' good, rod!"
65175,Marge,they're using pancakes as spoons!
59062,Marge,not if we want that vacation.
57870,Marge,are we still in little italy?
65116,Marge,homer! stop teasing!
54737,Marge,come here!
63811,Marge,"we know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a ""quirky"" way."
62477,Marge,"""dear homer simpson -- mr. burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
59743,Marge,get 'em off me! get 'em off! get 'em off!
63226,Marge,homer is so amazing! he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
58835,Marge,you cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid canyonero. why can't you drive it?
59745,Marge,but where did it come from?
54913,Marge,"homer, there's something i don't like about that severed hand."
65678,Marge,holy areole...
64325,Marge,i knew it!
64810,Marge,stupid pan.
63756,Marge,you live here?
61498,Marge,"well, i know who you are. and here's something to help you never forget!"
56843,Marge,"everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law. dog, no leash. man littering. horse not wearing diaper. car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
64131,Marge,"well, did he take all the blue roses with him?"
63711,Marge,"come and get me, you syrupy stack of man-cakes."
54719,Marge,is he making chicken noises?
65453,Marge,"homer! this is bad for you, too!"
63947,Marge,"homie, what's taking so long?"
65784,Marge,she's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.
63551,Marge,hello. hello?
62409,Marge,look who's sleeping in our bed again.
60098,Marge,not a very good one?
60203,Marge,how do we un-repress it?
63100,Marge,"homer, where are you?"
58313,Marge,"now, why don't you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? you two make an adorable pair."
66133,Marge,"oh my, what's that thing you're doing?"
54787,Marge,"boys, you better come in the house. you don't want to get the sniffles."
66061,Marge,one of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...
66892,Marge,reverend! reverend! they took homer!
63320,Marge,"homer, what took you so long? the game's almost over."
57683,Marge,"just remember, bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" they're bad people."
60762,Marge,"thank you, fellas."
60055,Marge,why did you put my name on the sign?
62867,Marge,"oh, hey ned! isn't today your cat's birthday? i remember 'cause she shares the date with patty labelle!"
59429,Marge,"so, you said on the phone you had something to tell me?"
59628,Marge,"bart, what do you mean, you have jury duty?"
65999,Marge,i am so proud. i would've been happy if bart was just a piano mover.
63970,Marge,really? i never knew that.
55934,Marge,i think we need a new hairdryer.
62559,Marge,tea? in the parlor?
64590,Marge,bon appétit!
61918,Marge,"well, i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons. where's the award for that?"
55083,Marge,wha'd you say? i can't understand you with all that distortion.
63064,Marge,we're going to dump it in the water to get the army drunk.
58965,Marge,"oh, thank you. are you okay?"
67251,Marge,but bart doesn't speak french.
59564,Marge,let me talk to otto.
63563,Marge,"boy, i really feel like a viking in this thing."
63353,Marge,is your baby a suckaholic?!
58422,Marge,"no, no, no, i have my part in this, too, um..."
62866,Marge,i don't know. maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.
59416,Marge,"i do! i do! wait, no i don't."
58323,Marge,we don't have a clapper.
67598,Marge,"well... i guess i can't, which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons."
54748,Marge,grampa?
61665,Marge,"no, no. that's the noise the phone makes when you've been on too long. bye now! love you."
67526,Marge,you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
59864,Marge,chief wiggum! are you here to make a bust of some kind?
55721,Marge,"while we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember great aunt gladys."
57465,Marge,"homer, i don't need you around me 24 hours a day. i'm a grown woman -- i can take care of myself. now, will you please just go away!"
59544,Marge,and you look adorable.
57366,Marge,thank you.
60831,Marge,"these are homer's friends and family. they don't want him dead, they just want him to suffer."
60500,Marge,sit down.
56159,Marge,"homer, what's going on down there?"
57045,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
61179,Marge,yay!
65372,Marge,a bunny! just like the one i had when i was a girl! how did you know?
59819,Marge,scary talented. and i'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it.
56086,Marge,"well... yes, i do. but they're all heirlooms, too."
67465,Marge,homer?!
60358,Marge,"hm, all clean, just the way i left it."
55442,Marge,almost everybody.
60982,Marge,"don't worry, honey. you can win without him."
57835,Marge,"inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?"
65366,Marge,on a night like tonight i have to believe there are.
58403,Marge,what happened? you didn't do anything.
67740,Marge,"aren't you ready for church, homer?"
64724,Marge,"i'd like this bag, please!"
57133,Marge,"homie. as long as you keep the car full of gas, i'm happy."
63584,Marge,"sweeties, we weren't fighting..."
66321,Marge,"homie, i think the kids are just hungry."
66617,Marge,"well, what do you want a job for?"
65492,Marge,"enough with the voting. ned, edna, why didn't you tell us?"
64197,Marge,ooh. the label is all in lowercase.
66449,Marge,i was just trying to learn the--
59547,Marge,awww...
60783,Marge,they've already told the skybox fans who's gonna win.
59816,Marge,titles are hard.
60290,Marge,"well, what about this? ""the duff book of world records."""
63518,Marge,i'm starting to worry about your father.
57276,Marge,just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about.
64317,Marge,"""beat, slay, shove."""
65262,Marge,yup!
56294,Marge,"homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
58724,Marge,kids! / i can nag and nag till my hair turns blue...
55102,Marge,"oh, look at that, a shoe box house. lisa, you're so clever."
65779,Marge,do you have to do that in front of people?
55737,Marge,... we really appreciate your taking the children on such short notice.
58797,Marge,deal!
56994,Marge,"i'd like to, honey, but i'm not sure how. your father can be surprisingly sensitive. remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat? he sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
67629,Marge,"well, we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
55557,Marge,worked for the carter administration?
60151,Marge,she's gonna find us!
65212,Marge,"sure, your dad's great, but i'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! d'oh! d'oh! d'oh!"
56336,Marge,is thursday okay?
63871,Marge,"okay, here goes. bart, i have something for you!"
63697,Marge,you don't have to tell the kids everything!
63540,Marge,you said you visited him every night.
57277,Marge,"""dear parents. due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. by reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
60013,Marge,i cut off my husband's thumb!
54976,Marge,"they want a name, homer, not a vague description."
63334,Marge,but they make me look dowdy...
67170,Marge,yes.
66067,Marge,"listen, i want us to be honest with each other."
58043,Marge,"my poor lisa. if you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... i feel sorry for you."
66920,Marge,"kids, you want to go christmas shopping?"
66057,Marge,"hi, homie! a crazy thing happened when i was ordering your anniversary gift."
62529,Marge,"oh, ba-art!"
57092,Marge,he's not my little baby anymore. maybe i mother him too much.
63202,Marge,"homer, you're back!"
56516,Marge,"here he is, rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one! that tonic really works! you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together."
62454,Marge,"really? well, just for that i'm gonna erase all the saved games on your playstation."
56548,Marge,but it's true. they didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.
57609,Marge,what?!
59687,Marge,"oh, krusty. i'm sure she just needs time to get used to you."
67438,Marge,"awww. come to bed, homie."
66348,Marge,that's it. that was the story.
60786,Marge,can you save our house?
64568,Marge,"ned flanders, you would take our family to the holy land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
61537,Marge,"okay, fine, he is."
61103,Marge,"eh, we can spend another week at the ranch."
56465,Marge,i won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
60835,Marge,"honey, the king of mardi gras has to ride around on a float all day. you'll be a sitting duck."
58217,Marge,but what if they try to talk us into something?
66471,Marge,"no! homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. you have to act like someone you'd want lisa to marry. if you just act like yourself, she might just... oh, you know?"
56056,Marge,"in honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of nevada?"
56076,Marge,homer! what is it? slow down.
55939,Marge,"good, now you hold maggie. i'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop."
63784,Marge,"and bart, you go with your father to shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs re-beaned."
58278,Marge,why all the black?
66901,Marge,but we don't need to come back. we saved the church.
54745,Marge,"oh, that must be the babysitter."
66863,Marge,"moe, i think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs."
59041,Marge,i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644. i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
55191,Marge,"no, behind her."
60858,Marge,there's a happy baby. aren't you? aren't you?
55228,Marge,"so you see, my sisters were wrong. except about the cities on the moon. i was wrong about that. so... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong."
65413,Marge,and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
54839,Marge,homie... put down your magazine for a minute...
56414,Marge,"when you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?"
55808,Marge,p.u.
60428,Marge,"and our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter."
56857,Marge,freeze!
66249,Marge,"bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. and i believe in you. yet again."
65855,Marge,thank you.
62734,Marge,i'll do it.
56968,Marge,"tell him yourself. you're ignoring lisa, not bart."
58363,Marge,"three, two, one..."
64301,Marge,"nelson, you really have a knack for this."
55463,Marge,"let's go, kids."
55633,Marge,we're going to have another baby.
54992,Marge,"well, duh."
61842,Marge,that coulda been me.
59553,Marge,"homer, look, we're invited to otto's wedding!"
60061,Marge,"yup, delaware's got it all."
67711,Marge,"you know, homer, you're like no one i've ever met before. you're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
67463,Marge,the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress.
61469,Marge,diamondelle?
54949,Marge,that's illegal.
63150,Marge,christmas card? i haven't even taken the photo yet!
64395,Marge,dinner's ready! dinner's ready!
65777,Marge,a whole weekend? i don't know...
62929,Marge,"homer, we need those tickets to get in!"
55541,Marge,"resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""lemon time""..."
61715,Marge,"now, i'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""w-b""..."
56986,Marge,"bart, what happened?!"
56555,Marge,okay. okay... but you're gonna make a big deal outta this. he was a pilot.
57481,Marge,"it's true, but he shouldn't say it."
58330,Marge,oh my god!
58342,Marge,why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
66707,Marge,i don't remember that!
60627,Marge,"oh my gosh, she's dead."
64993,Marge,"bart, why are you tugging on your collar?"
61846,Marge,"aunt patty, aunt selma, grandma bouvier and grampa!"
55896,Marge,i'm pretty sure there is.
65059,Marge,why did you seat us in siberia?
65409,Marge,is that hail coming down?
59822,Marge,two more bites.
65743,Marge,"""in this exciting strategy game, you amass resources -- timber, salt fish, and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice."
57544,Marge,"oh homie! homie, i'm so sorry i doubted you!"
64085,Marge,"i'll be right in, lisa!"
62525,Marge,where are you two going?
55819,Marge,of course.
58485,Marge,"i have to, honey. or... you can stay here and we'll have our own dance. ""every simpson dance now! bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp!"""
59954,Marge,why don't you try reaching out to this new girl? see if you two have a common interest.
55652,Marge,"well, bart, what do you think of little lisa?"
64390,Marge,you two are going out? i thought i told you the flanderses were coming over to dinner.
61281,Marge,"""kitchen carnival?"" i love it! thank you, homie."
61132,Marge,we don't have time for choking!
67778,Marge,"c'mon, patty. you don't want to show up looking like yosemite sam."
59140,Marge,i thought you'd like it. and i'm enjoying the friendship between showgirl and that seamstress.
59924,Marge,they wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
59990,Marge,a chimp!
57124,Marge,"well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
59277,Marge,you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
64081,Marge,"homie, i haven't held maggie all day. can you hand her to me?"
64526,Marge,"then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
64489,Marge,he usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds. want some coffee?
67789,Marge,hello.
55243,Marge,"bart, watch your language. oh. you did. sorry."
67867,Marge,really? you're so supportive. i wish every teacher was like you.
63105,Marge,"homer, you wanted a sign that i still love you, so here it is."
59010,Marge,"hey, that's cute."
56053,Marge,"hey, there's a turkey behind the bed."
55270,Marge,well of course he's a spy. you just saw him go through spy school!
63471,Marge,that doesn't sound like homer's usual annoyed grunt.
59102,Marge,shh!
60266,Marge,"lisa, it was probably an accident."
66748,Marge,why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
61667,Marge,here's to life without children!
62273,Marge,"homie, i'm worried you're turning into some kind of super koo-koo stage mother."
64853,Marge,how can you say a thing like that?
61545,Marge,"we should do more together. you're my best friend, homie."
64044,Marge,you mean back to the poor house?
55408,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, i'll be playing blanche. i made some peanut butter brownies for everyone."
59674,Marge,my experiment? you're the one who came up with this whole idea...
62434,Marge,"homer, don't touch her! you've never had chicken pox."
59942,Marge,not on my watch!
59371,Marge,good lord! this bedroom is as big as our house!
59124,Marge,"homer, we agreed we'd discuss the medication with bart."
63206,Marge,"for me, huh? what took you so long?"
60569,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
63820,Marge,the door's open! i think someone broke in!
66510,Marge,why can't kids still watch captain kangaroo?
67057,Marge,come on. you can do better than that.
56508,Marge,"this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. it's a book on tape by paul harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa."
62457,Marge,"innocent?! after all i do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. i'm finished with him."
60430,Marge,"for god's sake, homer. give them back their flame!"
66619,Marge,would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
57809,Marge,thank heavens!
62799,Marge,"i see you met our devout leader, ned flandish."
66891,Marge,homie. how did you end up at the casino?
66789,Marge,no woman uses one of these by choice.
65078,Marge,"in a good marriage, you never say i told you so."
57891,Marge,"oh, now be fair, edna. i liked armin tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt. skinner."
63269,Marge,that's why i got duplicates!
60040,Marge,"rachel jordan? isn't that the woman you had a crush on, ned?"
66958,Marge,"there's no guy with peanuts, dear."
65386,Marge,we're wetting the bed?
65672,Marge,the kids are a mess! you brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
63739,Marge,"wait, you mean she danced well, into her seventies? or she danced, well into her seventies?"
60455,Marge,have we gotten all the liquor?
63929,Marge,we'll stay for one hand roll or two nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
67393,Marge,you... you speak english.
58166,Marge,it's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children!
67055,Marge,"now, lisa, listen to me. this is important. i want you to smile today."
61062,Marge,you made your own breakfast?
60072,Marge,how romantic!
61206,Marge,you have your own baby monitor in our child's room?
58089,Marge,it's awfully small.
60252,Marge,we were looking for lisa!
65355,Marge,we're not monsters. we're just people. people who love each other and love this town. the only place we've ever called home. thank you.
67442,Marge,i don't know.
67384,Marge,"i don't care what i said. this family has had its differences, and we've squabbled, but we never had knife fights before... and i blame this house."
67158,Marge,oh!
55312,Marge,"ah, that's sweet."
58250,Marge,"have a great weekend, kids! be nice to the underprivileged countries."
66696,Marge,can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
64257,Marge,macbeth!
56571,Marge,could you start fixing it pretty soon? the basement is getting awfully flooded. and i think the cat's down there.
58521,Marge,slow and steady wins the race.
63004,Marge,you could do something nice for lisa.
54697,Marge,my sisters are nuts. i'm happy being married to homer. most of the time.
60698,Marge,simpson.
59575,Marge,stop kicking my baby!
67387,Marge,shush! shut up! quit trying to push us around. stop saying those horrible things and show some manners.
56818,Marge,"well, thank you, honey."
61590,Marge,really? even zima?
60952,Marge,but there must be some sort...
55977,Marge,i don't know.
61175,Marge,let's admire nelson's love of nature.
65135,Marge,"wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets..."
57709,Marge,"young lady, you will never babysit again! i am so disappointed -ointed... - ointed... -ointed..."
64128,Marge,no rockets! you can pick the frosting.
66634,Marge,"guys, this is gonna be hard for a while, but we'll get through this... as a family."
61359,Marge,save our families! sign our petition!
60646,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
58703,Marge,no...
61254,Marge,those fudruckers!
59323,Marge,"look at these. you bought them after the nagano olympics, and never skied once. if you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe..."
57292,Marge,"... and you're sure the flanderses won't be there? well, it sounds great!"
60739,Marge,that doesn't sound very convincing.
61351,Marge,then wait in the shadows!
65885,Marge,it's not a skirt. it's a kilt!
61829,Marge,that's an entry?! i thought it was garbage.
60451,Marge,oh.
62576,Marge,you're joking. you've gotta be joking.
63095,Marge,you're from texas?
57046,Marge,"all right, climb in."
61272,Marge,"no, it's too risky! we'll just wait till the traffic thins out. turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
62365,Marge,"listen, buster. i had to buy a club soda i didn't want to get change for this phone!"
58103,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. hutz, but i just can't lie to people."
56521,Marge,you tell bart all the time. you told him this morning.
65722,Marge,the end of the world as we know it?
64213,Marge,you just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. you can come home when the heat's off.
62063,Marge,"oh no. oh no. why would it be? i love you and i love gay marriage, so i'd be a super-hypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage. right?"
58684,Marge,"oh, homie. i'm so glad you're all right."
56952,Marge,bart!
65240,Marge,i'm a happily married woman!
65373,Marge,"oh bart, you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about!"
63139,Marge,really?
56312,Marge,"no, think about people. about moments in your life that have been very romantic."
57848,Marge,"you know, maybe chief wiggum is right. military school is a good idea."
65428,Marge,homer!
56978,Marge,it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
56630,Marge,"stop it, stop it. can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!"
58626,Marge,"i know you feel bad about the juice incident, but i'm sure you can make up for it somehow."
55427,Marge,"see you later, kids. ah've got to go rehearse with ned."
59645,Marge,"maybe i'd better check mine. ""today, your husband will die."" homer, i'm scared."
58352,Marge,i want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
66784,Marge,you've been working so hard lately. maybe you should take a break.
62744,Marge,i don't get it. are you saying you're the tree?
66785,Marge,none.
59175,Marge,shut up! shut up! shut up!
67357,Marge,"happy anniversary, homer."
66737,Marge,apu is a good man. he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the costington center.
61070,Marge,your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
62925,Marge,"look, homie, i brought you a beer."
64561,Marge,i thought you were fixing my brakes!
61093,Marge,don't rightly know. i just soaked up the lingo like a biscuit in a bucket full of gopher gravy. i'll stop now.
62465,Marge,"oh, homie..."
54957,Marge,thirty years?
58728,Marge,"oooh, ""free foot pain analysis?"""
62080,Marge,"lisa, you took out a restraining order against your own brother?"
66404,Marge,maybe.
58199,Marge,the undersea world certainly is full of wonders.
54902,Marge,i've got some good news. krusty the clown is coming to dinner tonight.
60417,Marge,homer was there?
61613,Marge,"principal skinner, i feel so bad for you."
59791,Marge,somebody help him!
54669,Marge,"promenade? with you? forget it, bub!"
60888,Marge,ten... e-le-ven... twelve!
63752,Marge,"homie, lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy."
64795,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
65557,Marge,are you going to fix the faucet or not?
62395,Marge,instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
59485,Marge,now what's wrong?
59159,Marge,"oh honey, i'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride."
62536,Marge,"let's see... what would be a good duet? hmm... ""just the two of us""... ""you and me against the world""... ""ebony and ivory""..."
67893,Marge,"umm... hello. my name is marge simpson and i painted this. maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. well, i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr. burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of god's creatures."
55248,Marge,"bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at springfield barber college."
67298,Marge,really?
57935,Marge,"you know, homer... i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?"
56147,Marge,there. i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
67580,Marge,yes?
59068,Marge,"hawaii, here we come!"
57119,Marge,wow!
57972,Marge,"homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts."
57800,Marge,"reverend, i gave ned flanders some bad advice. now he could be in real trouble."
67469,Marge,"oh, my best dress."
62770,Marge,"homie, i missed you so much! put your pants back on."
56170,Marge,a female deer.
59484,Marge,i don't know. i'm trying to sleep.
54797,Marge,butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
55614,Marge,"this might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind..."
60477,Marge,let's take a quick gambling break. a little action will really sharpen our senses.
64818,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie -- you seem upset."
61554,Marge,"well, you talk like marge, sorry i set the bed on fire."
57744,Marge,"homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?"
61720,Marge,i guess so.
55679,Marge,i don't know if i like you reading all those cardiology books.
60573,Marge,hm. where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?
62192,Marge,"homer, just settle down. we just got a postcard from maggie."
59332,Marge,skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun. the only risk i'm taking is running out of marshmallows!
62764,Marge,"there, there. god, i miss homer."
60834,Marge,"oh my, it's stuck!"
65653,Marge,homie? aren't you going to come in?
64107,Marge,while your father and your grandfather have a drink we're going to see sights.
63834,Marge,"yeah, well, we're adding clowns."
60938,Marge,are you sure? because it really spoke to me.
57779,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. you've got lots to live for."
62805,Marge,oh don't stop -- you're choking him just the way his father used to.
55909,Marge,i think this is a great opportunity. you could learn so much.
65868,Marge,my what?
67277,Marge,"oh, bart, my baby boy. welcome home."
56672,Marge,you are?
64300,Marge,what else?
60022,Marge,breakfast!
59005,Marge,yep.
63640,Marge,"listen, homer, i gotta be honest with you..."
63472,Marge,"you know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage."
66713,Marge,but where? i still don't know!
57203,Marge,"yes, dear. in your mind."
56332,Marge,what's brunch?
60446,Marge,bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
60585,Marge,we have to do something to save that marriage. maybe i should just tell manjula. or you could talk to apu...
59238,Marge,"kids, turn off the tv. i have some bad news about lenny."
61005,Marge,we've already been to room 915. we've already filled out form 1790.
58434,Marge,homer!
60237,Marge,"hey lisa, what are you doing?"
61111,Marge,people do crazy things in ads... like eat at arby's.
59565,Marge,"well, it doesn't have to be. otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you."
61159,Marge,"i love you, too."
55132,Marge,"i am not cleaning that... ah, who am i kidding?"
56450,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning. i really hope you try harder."
64264,Marge,now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare's greatest roles: king lear... hamlet...
57509,Marge,it looks so complicated... do you know how?
64479,Marge,"ooh, ice skating."
56171,Marge,"get a rope, bart!"
64198,Marge,it's like drinking e. e. cummings!
56877,Marge,isn't there anything we can do?
63440,Marge,wow. is it much different from a normal plane?
65396,Marge,"homie, this might be a clue! what's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies!"
61615,Marge,"no, i'm here to have a little girl-talk with mrs. krabappel."
66524,Marge,"you will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand."
63061,Marge,don't worry. i have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.
65125,Marge,"well, what brought you to springfield? was it our frito lay distribution center?"
62708,Marge,"ned, i know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
62887,Marge,"wow, that's what i would've said. well, i would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."
57342,Marge,"well, we could use the extra money... and this house is falling apart."
63928,Marge,can we use your phone?
66427,Marge,how about this... what if we give the van houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
54678,Marge,"those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me. because i know everything that you've done, and yet i still want to be with you."
65083,Marge,"homie, are you even listening to me?"
62665,Marge,"well, it creeps me out!"
55918,Marge,no. i want those geeks out of my house.
65017,Marge,but...
57938,Marge,"homie, is that you?"
60412,Marge,"get off me, you little... nerd!"
54739,Marge,"i want to make sure the kids don't hear. when i was young, i always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
63782,Marge,every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs! i want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial!
65846,Marge,your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. we've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
66664,Marge,homie... i think we're not alone.
61096,Marge,oh no! they're making beautiful music together!
60201,Marge,"oh, no..."
55425,Marge,it maght.
65200,Marge,it's my dream!
56511,Marge,so am i.
61706,Marge,"homer, that girl was me!"
56013,Marge,chasm?!
62766,Marge,"he's loved me ever since the first moment he saw me and he's never stopped. and whatever it takes to make me happy, he'll do it even if it kills him."
66644,Marge,there is no drive thru!
55041,Marge,yes.
65970,Marge,"oh moe, this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes!"
61728,Marge,i kept my heart too.
58665,Marge,"oh, thank heaven."
56615,Marge,you've worked hard at the bowling alley. why don't you ask for a raise?
66941,Marge,"yes, something to share our love --"
62619,Marge,what the hello kitty?
64481,Marge,this is what you're like when you don't drink!
55739,Marge,"well, to cheer you up i rented a couple of videos. ""boxing's greatest weigh-ins"" and ""yentl""."
66078,Marge,"what the heck am i saying? homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered."
66355,Marge,"bart's usually first in line for taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
66595,Marge,then that's what i'm gonna do.
62932,Marge,that's you!
58098,Marge,because it's so dilapidated.
57698,Marge,"actually, bart, lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
63158,Marge,"gil's gone? but i have a ""no"" inside me that has to come out."
60883,Marge,whack him with the hymnal. over.
66759,Marge,no casual racism!
57380,Marge,we're not picking him up!
61768,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
57505,Marge,"ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
57450,Marge,so who wants to play a game? hmm? hmm? hmm?
55148,Marge,that's nice. do you think you could loosen my cuffs?
62122,Marge,"oh, we're just saving for... a very rainy day."
61648,Marge,"bart, stop fooling with the remote!"
56342,Marge,good. does anyone else have a love story?
63645,Marge,"without the commercial interruption, i could really follow the story. tivo, you've got a season pass to my heart."
64368,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
58789,Marge,"oh, i'll make the whole thing."
57840,Marge,at least think of our dentist bills!
66038,Marge,"hi, homie! did you get the money? the kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!"
61672,Marge,"oh my god, homie! look!"
65236,Marge,...but my husband's acting pretty odd. coming home late. drinking in the morning.
54922,Marge,"that's it, young man. you're coming with me..."
62939,Marge,"homer, can i see you in the kitchen?"
56213,Marge,"maggie, we have a surprise for you."
67736,Marge,"homer, we talked about cable before. do you really think we can afford it?"
63927,Marge,you haven't said you're sorry.
62987,Marge,"actually, he's ten."
59296,Marge,and the first step is an eye-catching resumé.
59141,Marge,i heard about a new bar where men dance with men. doesn't that sound adorable?
56822,Marge,"two hundred. no! no! i mean, i mean nothing. i don't take bribes."
64666,Marge,"guys, guys, i'm married!"
58266,Marge,oh good lord.
62116,Marge,i'm not gonna worry just because homer doesn't have insurance. a lot of people don't!
65417,Marge,mike's hard!
55343,Marge,"oh, homer, i love you just the way you are. lisa, what's that number?"
63104,Marge,"they will be! ready, bullies?"
61157,Marge,what?
64149,Marge,i'm afraid i'm just... ms. simpson now.
65555,Marge,"homie, the faucet is dripping."
67060,Marge,"i said you could stop smiling, lisa."
56752,Marge,"yeeesch! this house stinks! you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
59543,Marge,and you will be a dancer.
57084,Marge,fine. play the tape. then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
56014,Marge,"stop that, bart. homer, speak to him."
61030,Marge,sounds good to me.
66468,Marge,it's not a punishment. but you can't just eat dinner. you have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
63588,Marge,hold on -- i still have to caramelize.
67338,Marge,"homer! go ahead, lisa."
55350,Marge,how cute. they don't open their mouths do they?
66287,Marge,"when i watched that pirated movie, i was stealing with my eyes. so i'm repaying the good people in hollywood for the ticket i should have bought."
62552,Marge,what's that smell?
63316,Marge,who cares? i'm dead.
67032,Marge,that's why he lashes out at the world.
60373,Marge,"when homer's jaw was crushed-crushed-crushed, his life took a nitro-burning funny turn!"
61221,Marge,"homer, it's trash day. will you just take him out to the curb?"
56903,Marge,"here's your toast, maggie. i melba-fied it myself."
59185,Marge,and eleven with robert urich.
60385,Marge,"artie, get off of me."
61302,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it!
60751,Marge,oh i'll come back all right. and i'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you.
63552,Marge,hello?
58494,Marge,whatever.
56343,Marge,"lisa, not all romances turn out that way. bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
56042,Marge,money's too tight for steak.
65208,Marge,uhh... yes! yes! east oak street. that's where you should go. see ya there!
55342,Marge,i wish they had never invented fried cheese!
63306,Marge,i was on the computer all night!
60245,Marge,"i was just making christmas cookies. but since you don't believe in christmas anymore, i guess you don't want any."
62234,Marge,"sweetheart, your friend ray is in your head."
67011,Marge,are we cured yet?
63245,Marge,"bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. if it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour."
61865,Marge,it's nice to be appreciated.
62801,Marge,"my friends call me ""marge""."
66145,Marge,"with the mighty tongue god's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?"
66763,Marge,homer?
57242,Marge,selma! troy doesn't love you at all! he's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!
62104,Marge,"plus, we get free apple, orange and grapefruit juice!"
56635,Marge,"hold still, homer. don't squirm."
63247,Marge,'you look at that paneling -- i feel like i'm back in wooden times!
64612,Marge,it's making our meter run backwards!
64848,Marge,those creepy little claws...
60360,Marge,what's going on?
62435,Marge,"oh, i'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! it could leave you sterile down there."
63706,Marge,what the?
60567,Marge,"i like ""little dot."" could you rip that off? i mean, who's gonna know?"
57751,Marge,"well, i think it's a great idea."
59762,Marge,"ready for the circus, homer?"
61058,Marge,"oh my god, i forgot all about this. where did you find it?"
60175,Marge,"burly?! i bought the wrong brand, maggie!"
57605,Marge,"we're over here, homie!"
58373,Marge,"good god, homer! you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trash-hole."
61711,Marge,anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner.
62860,Marge,maggie! my sweet little angel!
54805,Marge,but he's your boss. do you have to mail it right this minute?
64756,Marge,i still think it's too violent.
63264,Marge,now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives.
63821,Marge,"homie, what's going on?"
59963,Marge,"that's quite an act to follow, lisa."
62653,Marge,i'm out of drugs! see how much money i made?!
59934,Marge,it's been a whole week! why are you letting my husband die? what does that have to do with baseball?
55197,Marge,we'll all help.
64322,Marge,someone should tell your principal!
63757,Marge,"well, at least she's got a friend."
67494,Marge,"everyone, lisa wants to read us a poem she's written."
63345,Marge,there it is -- ol' bounce 'n' giggle.
57647,Marge,shush everybody! it's coming on!
62037,Marge,"oh did he? homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!"
60126,Marge,no!
57771,Marge,"all done! i swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
57305,Marge,"i know you're joking -- but it is! say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
59153,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to be hunting for bart!"
55430,Marge,forget about him. let's rehearse the bottle scene!
66276,Marge,my uncle died in your bed. merry christmas.
65643,Marge,the only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars.
57638,Marge,thanks for everything!
66251,Marge,"this has gone far enough. i'm starting to think this ""school project"" is more than meets the eye."
58777,Marge,"well, i'm glad you changed your name back to homer simpson."
61878,Marge,i didn't give your son charity. i gave him self-respect.
66220,Marge,i'm a schwarzenegger wife.
63173,Marge,"it's the famous barnacle bay fog! there's even a poem about it! ""oh cotton candy in gossamer light / thy soft gray kiss upon my cheek"" it smells like heinie!"
67540,Marge,... but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way...
56188,Marge,are you sure you can get him back for us?
58729,Marge,i guess.
56429,Marge,hmph. it's raining again.
55436,Marge,"i'm looking for my sister, stella."
56335,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
55898,Marge,you awful man. stay away from my son.
66012,Marge,did you pass?
61326,Marge,i've dreamed of the day you'd say that!
64648,Marge,my mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
64605,Marge,"that's drug talk! but i could be mistaken. let me just listen to a little more, out of context."
55750,Marge,"no, no. someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""the corey hotline."""
59279,Marge,what in the world?
56372,Marge,"now wait a minute. i'm not sure about this. every time we've ever gone on vacation, i end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
67646,Marge,"get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!"
67733,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
56072,Marge,i won sixty dollars last night.
66714,Marge,i'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
56541,Marge,thirty dollars will be fine.
58404,Marge,"homer, what's going on? shouldn't you be at work?"
59672,Marge,homer...
61989,Marge,mm-hmm.
65296,Marge,"it wasn't just her, homie. it was all of us."
58753,Marge,but her forehead's on fire.
58260,Marge,"look, homer. there's that bird you like to argue with."
66534,Marge,that's good.
59713,Marge,hold still.
55215,Marge,"lisa, it's not that bad."
60291,Marge,it's got pictures of deformities.
61794,Marge,"the articles, eh? so you wouldn't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes?"
54597,Marge,i can't believe i got in. it's like a dream come true. an expensive dream.
55377,Marge,"bart, where's your bathing suit?"
66183,Marge,marge simpson! it's so nice to meet a friend homer met through the mail who isn't a sea monkey!
57012,Marge,"oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
58748,Marge,"homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named anthony michael hall who stole your car stereo."
67417,Marge,"okay, homer. fair enough. you got it! all right! good! that's it. that's how i'm gonna express myself. that's right. goodnight."
65570,Marge,i still smell it!
66573,Marge,"sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
65584,Marge,"...but we aren't making a baby. i thought we should check, to make sure homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon."
56374,Marge,even worse was our trip to sandy beach.
60449,Marge,take him outside.
65884,Marge,interesting. except you missed one thing.
59382,Marge,all i'm saying is don't get too comfortable. mr. burns will be back tomorrow.
62148,Marge,you hide food in my hair... you think brushing your teeth is foreplay...
55470,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad to hear you say that."
56390,Marge,"see all that stuff in there, homer? that's why your robot never worked."
57344,Marge,"even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
63942,Marge,my husband!
54835,Marge,"well, at least we got a free sample of reading digest."
64558,Marge,"mister, you are grounded!"
55336,Marge,no.
56504,Marge,i simply can't wait that long. maybe we should get some help... how 'bout a book?
61571,Marge,just take me home.
57300,Marge,"no, springfield is ""america's crud-bucket."" at least according to newsweek."
58392,Marge,"just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. you can get a picture of your mommy with a mummy."
60933,Marge,please give the church back.
62636,Marge,"oh homie, i always believed you were gonna make it, no matter what that pushy casket salesman said."
54637,Marge,i will!
65394,Marge,why does maggie have to go?
56293,Marge,i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. you're being completely paranoid.
59925,Marge,"oh, homie, i love them. i can't thank you enough."
55719,Marge,if you don't mind! we're on our way to a funeral.
62225,Marge,"we better get you home. come on, lisa."
55327,Marge,and it came with a free instruction book.
62166,Marge,"you know, we should visit shelbyville more often. they have a store that just sells shoes. i feel like i'm in paris!"
64359,Marge,i always have.
64826,Marge,"lisa, honey, i insist. because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me."
64208,Marge,...and because of cutbacks they were combining math with p.e. they were playing dodge book!
67506,Marge,"well, lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. we could go to both."
66520,Marge,they're always bragging about their trip to rome. it was twelve years ago and it was a layover. i want new friends!
56560,Marge,i want to see daddy fly!
59367,Marge,"homer, sit down."
56655,Marge,"oh, for the love of criminy! gimme that! i know bart did something wrong, but he's my son and i'm going to punish him myself."
58321,Marge,"oh, see, i knew you'd find something you liked about him."
59023,Marge,i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. when was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
61266,Marge,do you understand any part of what you just said?
56141,Marge,homer!
61507,Marge,where'd you find these?
60621,Marge,"...homer's family needs him too, and that's that."
64556,Marge,"and there's a map of the subway system attached. homer, we've got to stop him!"
65949,Marge,how?
65576,Marge,"homer, the reason i hate this car is... i think i want another baby!"
59269,Marge,a fifties-style restaurant.
61074,Marge,bart! that's not right.
58641,Marge,why don't you play with one of bart's video games instead? hugh downs says they're the latest craze.
54869,Marge,you got a job? doing what?
66342,Marge,"oh, absolutely. these sessions keep me on an even keel."
60771,Marge,did you just drug me?
59656,Marge,go back and get them!
55863,Marge,mr. hutz --
54841,Marge,"thank you, homie."
59549,Marge,"there she is! hi, honey! wow, look at her go."
64651,Marge,stop that sniffing! it's not for you! they're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.
57750,Marge,"lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
67285,Marge,hmmm hmmm.
54645,Marge,just do it already!
61538,Marge,i'm so happy to be getting my husband back.
65958,Marge,i sent you to the store to get applesauce for maggie two hours ago!
64180,Marge,huh? a mysterious door!
57038,Marge,sleep tight.
61528,Marge,i thought you were playing catch with artie.
63545,Marge,"i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for dwight. in fact, i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
61295,Marge,"it's homer, don't shoot!"
66555,Marge,you're not mad anymore?
58919,Marge,"good-bye, homer."
56760,Marge,"dinner's on, dogs!"
61235,Marge,don't tell me you're actually going.
55742,Marge,"hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
67349,Marge,wake up and look at the snow.
67718,Marge,couldn't we just use rouge for this?
62444,Marge,"oh boy, am i beat! if you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
56922,Marge,what are you doing with my children?!
61275,Marge,"bart, you're not helping."
56435,Marge,bart! lisa! time for church.
64910,Marge,who's kicking?
56043,Marge,"sure, steak."
56368,Marge,"no, i've already planned our vacation. we're going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary. i understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
59300,Marge,"excellent, ramrod. civilized people solve their disputes with words."
65077,Marge,this doesn't make any sense. there was a wedding. you exchanged vows.
58558,Marge,how vile.
61192,Marge,"moe, i'm glad you're here! i wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so i knitted you a nice warm sweater."
55069,Marge,would you mind if i took it off now? the oil is burning my finger.
58292,Marge,because your father has a big surprise for you!
55906,Marge,it's so good to be home again.
66346,Marge,"oh, i bet my story's more interesting."
59318,Marge,"this box? oh, nothing."
59702,Marge,"oh my, they made you a shrine!"
66531,Marge,i'd like to be alone for a while.
56741,Marge,but won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
57284,Marge,this is so exciting. last time i got to go backstage was when bart ripped his pants at the christmas play.
55307,Marge,"selma, i've never seen you so happy. giggling like a schoolgirl."
54593,Marge,tonight i learned the two of us can't work.
62943,Marge,"buck, tabitha, welcome. we'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here."
62058,Marge,"you're getting married?! patty, that's wonderful!"
61098,Marge,but they're already acting like teenagers. lisa's with that boy... and look at maggie!
59030,Marge,and that's where the bookmobile lady used to live!
62893,Marge,i'd love to.
59105,Marge,"um, will you be reading the cards yourself, mel?"
58817,Marge,hmmm... sometimes i find pickle slices in the sheets.
67307,Marge,"oh, oh, homer. i feel giddy. wait, what about a babysitter?"
55793,Marge,"homer, lisa needs braces."
55687,Marge,"oooh, it looks like everyone in springfield showed up for this."
56696,Marge,"homer, the guest should get the last pork chop."
58690,Marge,"you know, i really don't care for that code name."
67063,Marge,"oh, calm down, homer. lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family."
64162,Marge,those are two different people!
64406,Marge,"well, i think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in lisa's life is which boy will marry her. right, homer? homer?"
57816,Marge,hello.
63608,Marge,no! don't talk like that! there's always hope.
58130,Marge,homer!
57232,Marge,"wait, kids. you can't give up on itchy and scratchy. you're always so good at these things. why, together you've reunited krusty with his father, gotten principal skinner his job back, and helped dr. riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. you've even foiled sideshow bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
64609,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's adorable! this one's going on the christmas tree."
58877,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you can come out now."
64548,Marge,i'm going to find my husband. but don't depress the kids.
61186,Marge,exactly. the pre-teen braves.
57248,Marge,"the national grammar rodeo! i wish i were going. oh, wait, wait -- i mean, i wish i was going. is that right, bart?"
62402,Marge,"tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... homer, stop that!"
66900,Marge,they sure did... casino management.
56192,Marge,"that's sweet, honey."
60841,Marge,"it's nice and cool in here, don't you think?"
58177,Marge,you don't deserve an allowance.
64516,Marge,"cheer up, sweetie. maybe we can find the answer in the library!"
65404,Marge,"case closed! now, let's return our dream skis."
66274,Marge,any more questions?
62562,Marge,"no, i don't. i'm still upset about what happened today. i don't have many friends and when i finally start to make some, you ruin it!"
60816,Marge,yeah. if we read books we could form a club.
67758,Marge,"well, don't give up. when you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing."
57537,Marge,oh. come. come in.
54817,Marge,"well then, i guess the moral is, ""no good deed goes unrewarded."""
61421,Marge,"well, i guess that part is loosely based on your father."
63314,Marge,how could you kill your own mother?
56370,Marge,hmm?
58541,Marge,"you disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?"
59609,Marge,"becky, i want to apologize to you...surper!"
67845,Marge,"homer, are you sure this is the right way? the road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy."
67423,Marge,"i hope you'll space out the tubs this year, homer."
62103,Marge,just think about the day you found that junior mint in your bellybutton.
60533,Marge,i'll just get her this bracelet.
57185,Marge,without. let me go!
62027,Marge,solar.
67584,Marge,well... let's see... oh! couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy? then they would both have pie.
66686,Marge,our. water. was. on. fire!
66903,Marge,"ooo, careful, homer."
58910,Marge,you didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
67432,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i didn't say that this scares me a little. but we all have a calling, a reason the almighty put us on this earth. and yours might be to dance on dugouts."
67748,Marge,"just charge me something, please."
61292,Marge,that man and his foolish pride! we've gotta go follow him.
63532,Marge,"well, if i know doctors, he's probably golfing."
61415,Marge,"ned, that's so considerate."
58755,Marge,bart?
65094,Marge,at some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.
62045,Marge,homer!
57041,Marge,"goodnight, lisa."
66658,Marge,"well, i guess we could try it for a semester."
56931,Marge,this is so humiliating.
60197,Marge,i guess it was a pretty funny prank. i like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
58529,Marge,that's your underwear.
62921,Marge,"wow, darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive. and his ship was the beagle, which reminds me of snoopy... my favorite peanut!"
54688,Marge,my eye!
56578,Marge,"i know, i know."
55017,Marge,"""if ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". well, i guess i'd better go see dr. hibbert."
62701,Marge,we had a lot of fun. they're terrific kids.
59982,Marge,"oh, thank you. your ground is so comfortable."
62742,Marge,that's wonderful!
64418,Marge,okay!
56519,Marge,"homie, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life?"
58881,Marge,"wake up, homer."
61117,Marge,that cat saved your life.
61841,Marge,"b.f.d. i've had your scrambled eggs, homer. the secret ingredient is whiskey."
67342,Marge,"oooh, your third bowl... i think you may be on the mend. is there anything else i can get you?"
60372,Marge,aww...
56612,Marge,homer! let your father tell the story.
66498,Marge,nothing for thirty years. you're perfect for each other.
61119,Marge,"okay kids, stay together!"
63114,Marge,now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.
57082,Marge,that's crazy! bart's not a shoplifter! he's just a little boy!
61884,Marge,"bart, have you ever eaten a tootsie pop? you know, there's a tough crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside. be nice to nelson and i'll give you a tootsie pop."
57483,Marge,why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
66186,Marge,"i asked him here to cheer you up, but i didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, spaniard."
62124,Marge,i have a book from the library with the same information!
57725,Marge,what on earth happened down there?
65912,Marge,okay. but every man deserves a second chance. as long as he doesn't...
59498,Marge,is he a maneater?
65651,Marge,"hm, i guess you're right. i guess i'll have to scratch that off the list of things i say."
64759,Marge,"oh homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters."
61682,Marge,"shut up and kiss me, you doomed hunk!"
64822,Marge,"hm, i never figured him for the bully type."
58960,Marge,"yes, god."
63148,Marge,"well, just let 'em finish this one song..."
61122,Marge,my poor boy. will he be all right?
67329,Marge,"homer, would it spoil the mood if i called home? you know, just to check on the kids?"
64371,Marge,and every month is me! i don't remember doing this! i certainly don't remember doing august!
58349,Marge,"lisa, please. you have absolutely no reason to be jealous. you're still a very important part of bart's show."
66081,Marge,"such great characters, like buxton the scheming larder-keep. why can't lady cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?"
62456,Marge,no.
59910,Marge,thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob.
59095,Marge,they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring mel gibson!
60142,Marge,"concentrate, homer."
55553,Marge,what are you putting in there?...
62760,Marge,that song was very nice. how'd you think up so many rhyming words?
65067,Marge,"these people are always grinding against each other, and i think they're all related. i wish we'd never come."
62179,Marge,"ooh, a tiffany's box! and the thing inside is from tiffany's! homie, you've never done this before. how'd you afford it?"
67720,Marge,what are you doing here?
61130,Marge,we'll see.
58120,Marge,"i couldn't agree more. from now on, it's plastic all the way."
57463,Marge,"edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- ah!... homer! what are you doing?!"
66761,Marge,i'm sorry. i'm trying to find my husband and nothing's open.
62745,Marge,"as long as it's not a knock-knock joke. i always ruin them by saying ""come in."""
66692,Marge,well that's better.
59847,Marge,not yet. you have to guess what it is.
57339,Marge,"homer, i don't want to leave springfield. i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to hoist myself out of it."
56953,Marge,"i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for once. besides, i'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... god only knows."
65235,Marge,"i'm sorry to bother you at home, mr. marlowe..."
54620,Marge,"oh no, narcotics!"
63968,Marge,well maybe...
66089,Marge,are you watching it?
56784,Marge,marge!
66428,Marge,sure.
59878,Marge,"oh, that's okay. bart's doing fine. you just have another beer."
63093,Marge,"homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. i'm as hopeful and full of life as i was in the years before i met you."
67522,Marge,"well, he's got a pretty good father."
67577,Marge,yes. i'd like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. thank you.
65007,Marge,"now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours."
66436,Marge,i could write a check with... today's date on it.
60519,Marge,that's right. they have powers.
59971,Marge,"hey, the dog smells something!"
58273,Marge,"oh, knock it off, homer. you're the fattest one in the car..."
60420,Marge,"grampa, that happened a year and a half ago! we have to go save homer."
65930,Marge,but they let me take fabric samples!
64860,Marge,"well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
65247,Marge,and maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
57003,Marge,good. good for you.
67714,Marge,"you knew the city forensics finals are tomorrow. and you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. homer j. simpson, i hate you!"
57847,Marge,no! no drugs. bart just needs a little discipline.
56606,Marge,"wait a minute, wait, i know that look. now promise you won't tell homer."
65300,Marge,homie! stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
67685,Marge,"hm, i guess it's the tissue paper inside."
56239,Marge,i don't know what you're talking about.
61261,Marge,"a subscription to ""bartforum"" magazine, , and bart will say ""eat my shorts"" on your home answering machine."
61491,Marge,all our children are smart. some are just smarter than the others.
62695,Marge,"so, you're gonna be ""chillin'"" with me tonight. do you want to play a game?"
67345,Marge,"there, there, bart. you're just a late bloomer."
63318,Marge,"don't worry, honey. i'll hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one."
58712,Marge,"good hustle, kid."
57239,Marge,it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
56467,Marge,"moe, i think you should leave."
61172,Marge,"yeah, indians don't sit around drinking beer and watching tv."
61838,Marge,that's clever... and devastating. stop the competition!
62342,Marge,"now bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?"
67151,Marge,hmmm.
57240,Marge,"what?!! oh, my god!"
60133,Marge,"you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much i love my kids."
63262,Marge,this disasterette was a real wake up call. we need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
64005,Marge,i'm just trying to--
56024,Marge,i didn't realize people saw me that way.
55644,Marge,"we were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect..."
61109,Marge,there's no net!
56075,Marge,"sure, honey. i promise."
57428,Marge,uh... sorry.
67669,Marge,wake up! you're alive! you're alive!
56303,Marge,"homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
65981,Marge,a library volunteer? someone to purell the cpr dummy?
61482,Marge,"well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch."
57375,Marge,"next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. just look at all this beautiful foilage."
60374,Marge,"oh yeah! it's important to grow-grow-grow, but if you take it to the max-max-max, it's gonna get ugly!"
63159,Marge,"even though gil left, i still have to kick him out. i need this, or i'll never be able to say ""no."""
56918,Marge,"this is so relaxing. homie, this was a wonderful idea."
66134,Marge,who cares what happened? daddy's back!
60234,Marge,"oh honey, i'm worried about your soul. i want at least one person from this family to go to heaven."
61168,Marge,"here are some supervised activities we can all do together. future veterans of foreign wars, the 5-h club..."
65245,Marge,the farthest thing from this office i know: rafting down rattler river canyon.
58713,Marge,"but only by two points. and they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory."
55821,Marge,"mr. burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
62905,Marge,i don't recognize that name.
65500,Marge,no weird hookups!
62849,Marge,"oh, you're sweet. i'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?"
58479,Marge,you could raise some emus...
59886,Marge,i just wanted to win for once. please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
66406,Marge,go! go! go!
58258,Marge,"homer, quiet. you'll queer the deal."
62394,Marge,we have to stop all this construction. the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jell-o.
64541,Marge,"well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
65973,Marge,"every time i call grampa's phone, i get no answer."
62672,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride."
64497,Marge,"well, homer's my soul mate! and you don't dump a soul mate!"
58890,Marge,it's just until we pay off daddy's desecration of a priceless artifact. i thought i'd never have to say that again.
56530,Marge,"yes, but i'd rather not talk about it."
66235,Marge,"thank you, mr. bergstrom. i'll tell lisa you dropped by."
61956,Marge,"homer, these are people you work with. show some restraint."
64763,Marge,he's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
55164,Marge,"""bungee jumping, kayaking, calligraphy, cigar making, hula dancing... hmm... i guess i've done everything."
63994,Marge,are your parents okay with that? they've never met us.
56512,Marge,kids? kids?
54887,Marge,"bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
58169,Marge,"okay, who wants dinner?"
58675,Marge,"oh, i know you're scared, homie. but remember why you're doing this. it's for your father. the man who raised you and nurtured you."
60536,Marge,"oh, you two! we're eating genetically modified vegetables! look how big they are."
55223,Marge,bad dog! very bad dog.
55401,Marge,maybe i should have taken a nice calligraphy class.
65283,Marge,that's toothpaste!
54727,Marge,homer! you promised!
65435,Marge,it means i'm mad!
56790,Marge,that's the same thing! you just replaced dees with doos!
56604,Marge,"i've got to tell homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. until then please, keep this to yourselves."
66937,Marge,maybe i should call the police.
64711,Marge,bup-up-up! safety locks!
66073,Marge,"wait, wait, wait! let me get the stain out. but not here..."
67528,Marge,"no, maggie! bad baby!"
61430,Marge,and you're fine with me trying to get it published?
61306,Marge,maybe now we can get that padding that goes under rugs.
65361,Marge,i miss our home and i want to go back.
57902,Marge,"oh, honey, i can't right now. bart's gonna be late!"
55111,Marge,"no, no, no, you have to try it on."
54690,Marge,homer?! i wasn't expecting you.
55584,Marge,that medicine's not for you.
65149,Marge,what happened?!
58486,Marge,"oh, honey, don't eat that. wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?"
66641,Marge,they're opening another mother hubbard -- across the street?! how could they? how could they?!
61579,Marge,i can't believe you did that to me.
55020,Marge,"hmmm, what do you think about?"
59937,Marge,"and kids, you're gonna miss the school bus!"
65284,Marge,now i have to change the nipple!
65297,Marge,no strangling on school days!
60815,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to find a new way to entertain ourselves."
57115,Marge,ooh.
66054,Marge,i'm a fan of animation.
60043,Marge,"homer, don't you have any respect?"
64384,Marge,why don't you just roll me?
60460,Marge,there is no xfl this year. the league folded.
57293,Marge,"bart, you can invite milhouse. lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
61549,Marge,"don't tell mama what mama don't like. come here, you big lug!"
58211,Marge,no fires.
66885,Marge,it's not gambling! it's math.
60473,Marge,he used to be such an angel. maybe you should give him another chance.
62222,Marge,"yeah, i bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
62699,Marge,"i'm a ""star wars."" now let's see who you've drawn!"
62895,Marge,i've got amnesia and i have three kids.
60642,Marge,my love. you saved my life.
58899,Marge,this sounds juicy.
63280,Marge,"sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. it's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
58070,Marge,"well, this neighborhood is zoned r-3, which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys, and, oh... oh i'll never memorize all this."
59828,Marge,you remember jack... he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
58165,Marge,i think you move like a young baryshnikov!
66328,Marge,for once i'm grabbing the goody.
64248,Marge,macbeth!
61827,Marge,even the pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
64260,Marge,why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes?
64434,Marge,maybe you're not really mad at grampa. maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
56060,Marge,"hi, homie."
58003,Marge,"look, i want a cup."
61831,Marge,"well, it's not my fault! lisa, the people in this bake-off are stinkers, who pushed me and pushed me, like the pushy-wushies they are!"
60757,Marge,"homer, let me explain something--"
66135,Marge,"i know, he's changed."
55026,Marge,"oh, homer."
57031,Marge,do they have to play that rock music?! every note is pounding into my skull!
65972,Marge,"and look over there, moe."
61673,Marge,"that boy failed show and tell, but he's on our ass like sherlock holmes."
66345,Marge,it's not a secret. it's a funny story.
65858,Marge,it's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills. what kind of person revels in disapproval?!
66035,Marge,we're not broken!
61548,Marge,"stop it, seinfeld."
56660,Marge,this is a special occasion. patty and selma just got promoted at the dmv.
66547,Marge,"so as her teacher, i was wondering if you could tell me why lisa has such trouble making friends."
54955,Marge,"homer, where have you been? i was so worried."
64611,Marge,"come on, let's go! what are you waiting for? come on."
67952,Marge,coming right up. mind if i turn on a little music?
67915,Marge,"oh, and homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so i can have a girls' night out?"
59573,Marge,"actually, that was becky, too."
59614,Marge,"well, that's a relief, too, knowing i'm not crazy. so i guess everything really worked out for the--"
58284,Marge,i'll go get the bactine.
56549,Marge,i don't think so.
62652,Marge,"well, maybe someone else can help you, but i am not a drug grocer!"
64903,Marge,"we called ourselves ""the cool moms."""
66163,Marge,must find way... to blame myself.
57796,Marge,hmmm. oh well.
61785,Marge,"it's so beautiful and modern. ooh, a sub-zero fridge..."
60996,Marge,"today's book is ""bridget jones' diary."" now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it."
65121,Marge,i put a slice of apple in it!
63146,Marge,"homie, wake up! i rented that negligee you like."
66033,Marge,maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.
67177,Marge,"good night, homer."
60925,Marge,what are you doing?
55200,Marge,"oh, that's very good, lisa."
55709,Marge,how fast are they going?
64519,Marge,"this one doesn't sound roadkill-y. and, it comes with a story. ""many years ago, my daughter, eliza, brought a runaway slave, virgil, to the house..."""
56631,Marge,"say moe, was it a duck?"
64421,Marge,"a few more minor adjustments, aaand..."
60530,Marge,"excuse me, we think this boy might be here."
67370,Marge,"hello, everyone. you know, halloween is a very strange holiday. personally, i don't understand it. kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on t.v. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. things like the following half hour. nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which i totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. thanks for your attention."
57243,Marge,"i'm honored, bart. and lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with dad. you've been interested in nuclear power for years."
59330,Marge,who's disco stu?
67358,Marge,"don't worry, homie. this year you have an excuse for not remembering, what with your job and --"
63858,Marge,i hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
54914,Marge,"oh, my land!"
59900,Marge,why don't we stop this nonsense. i'm not mad anymore.
58243,Marge,"homer, you don't have to go with them!"
58423,Marge,"homie, you got your, your elbow in..."
60666,Marge,somebody does care!
56763,Marge,"bart, leave that crowbar here. you know i don't like you prying and jimmying."
60306,Marge,but we're on hiatus. everyone's everywhere.
63483,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
64812,Marge,not a good time!
67137,Marge,excuse me... where do i throw this?
54950,Marge,"hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
58234,Marge,"so, you kids really love the leader, huh? even more than your parents?"
66437,Marge,great! now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
62568,Marge,"would i?! now let's see... homer cut up my wedding dress to make a badminton net -- which he never uses, he spent my last three birthdays in jail, called out his bowling ball's name during sex..."
64345,Marge,there must be another way...
54706,Marge,"this place is so boring. if somebody doesn't do something interesting, i'm gonna have to. but what?"
58806,Marge,"oh, i hope we didn't get apu in too much trouble."
65290,Marge,"homie, i'm glad you're passionate, i just hope you're not riling people up with your show."
61160,Marge,only with kisses.
59602,Marge,oh... i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane.
66995,Marge,"homie, get in the car."
67390,Marge,"oh, don't call me lady. my name is marge simpson, this is my family and we're not going anywhere. we're all going to have to live together, so you better get used to it... please."
65223,Marge,"oh honey, i'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. but you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?"
55332,Marge,i don't understand this. why can't you stay with your parents?
60517,Marge,"oh, aren't you sweet? sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy."
56525,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden."
63473,Marge,"homer, can't we please be alone? it's our anniversary."
55066,Marge,homer... come home with me.
67819,Marge,those are very elaborate sneakers.
57368,Marge,what? what?! what am i missing? what?
63790,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart. but sometimes your mom knows best."
67119,Marge,"well, homer and i had a lovely dining experience at chez pierre... or the rusty barnacle is nice..."
57093,Marge,here's your hot chocolate.
57169,Marge,"all right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. we can't afford a single slip-up. they're judging us."
56941,Marge,he's going to baptize our children?
62168,Marge,this is the worst crisis the springfield cultural activities board has ever faced.
65062,Marge,we're throwing the brunch!
57667,Marge,... sexual.
58813,Marge,"hey, look at this one. it's a poem. from apu!"
57484,Marge,my main finger?
67604,Marge,bart! bart!
61745,Marge,"homeland noodles with uncle sam balls? apu, aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism?"
56458,Marge,"don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your mother. i know. how about we play the basketball? i'm no harvey globetrotter, but..."
61930,Marge,"lisa -- breakfast! i know you're mad at me, but i hope you're not mad at cap'n crunch..."
57528,Marge,bad dog!
59465,Marge,"my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10
69808,243,293,homer simpson: ah"
61399,Marge,thank you!
64752,Marge,you're not going to the dentist!
55684,Marge,"ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend mr. burns' money."
62260,Marge,"i already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner."
61927,Marge,shiner be gone.
64075,Marge,"it's okay, homie -- you can have my viewer."
66434,Marge,an atm receipt?
56862,Marge,that's it! there's too much corruption on this force. i quit!
57529,Marge,bad cat!
63687,Marge,no!!! that's my memory box!
64008,Marge,i'm bart simpson's mother. you think you've got any tricks i haven't seen?
64297,Marge,"okay, i'm going to put a stop to this ""ultimate punching."""
63071,Marge,"seventy-two lousy events, and grampa hasn't won a single medal."
67427,Marge,homer... homer... x.y.z.
57053,Marge,"well, duh."
62788,Marge,"should we take all our stuff, or are we coming back on this boat too?"
55949,Marge,"lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. don't worry, honey, the scary part's over."
64348,Marge,"mm, there's something odd about this beer."
62574,Marge,"ooh! well, now i really hope my chute opens!"
58487,Marge,"okay, but you've accomplished a lot. you've made me very happy."
62341,Marge,"well, i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too. how do you like those croutons?"
64793,Marge,there's my old house!
57955,Marge,not all of them...
66739,Marge,see you soon!
66677,Marge,you know what? i trust them not to smoke.
63751,Marge,"there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. look at me, i'm glowing!"
67102,Marge,gambling.
64828,Marge,what business?
63669,Marge,i'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
56300,Marge,wake up!
55666,Marge,nice healthy oatmeal.
59705,Marge,"now that our son is an honor student, i'm going to get one of those bumper stickers that informs strangers of that fact."
62025,Marge,"ned, there's more to the bible than blood and gore."
58220,Marge,you what?!
56663,Marge,homer!
65724,Marge,"homie, i never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble."
59767,Marge,watching those women is giving me ideas...
55826,Marge,"""third notice,"" ""final notice,"" ""some guys are coming.""... ooh, what's this?"
66424,Marge,but the van houtens are our friends!
64794,Marge,we're not here for rabbit. i used to live in this house as a girl.
59293,Marge,haven't any of you ever had a dream?
56609,Marge,and then when i told him about lisa...
59088,Marge,"oh, i'm afraid this might be the end."
66877,Marge,"yeah, so, uh, i'm going out to rehearse... the revue."
61091,Marge,i didn't gasp like that until i was eighteen!
61691,Marge,listen... i'm married.
61758,Marge,the food is so delicious here. and these chanel suits are five for a dollar! i'm using a jacket as a napkin.
58090,Marge,that's dilapidated.
59181,Marge,who could be calling at this hour?
61869,Marge,"great roll, nelson! here, i cut up your hot dog for you."
56583,Marge,"no. the family simpson, which has just five members. and only two of those members have special rings."
64145,Marge,we are now eleven seconds behind schedule!
59261,Marge,"yes, dear. from the nuclear plant."
67156,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
58069,Marge,"so, you're married and you're looking for your first house, mr. and mrs..."
55390,Marge,"kids, i won't be home tonight, so i'm leaving you some low-cal microwavable tv dinners."
57274,Marge,"oh, homer. are you rounding up immigrants?"
65853,Marge,is this true?
63909,Marge,"i made it with cheetos, just like you like it. if the sauce is too thick, i can add more root beer."
67276,Marge,"goodbye, adil. it was a pleasure..."
63256,Marge,"yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening."
56724,Marge,maggie! don't talk with your mouth full.
57824,Marge,"i wouldn't bother him, honey. he's making some kind of model for a contest. he says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
57444,Marge,"oh, good. that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham."
64428,Marge,"oh, there's so many photo ops, but i already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot c sign... the tram... a license plate from canada..."
67603,Marge,"aw, well isn't that nice."
57973,Marge,does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
59843,Marge,then why are you hiding?
57247,Marge,"of course! of course! i would never, ever have thought of that!"
55335,Marge,no.
64601,Marge,i give up!
65840,Marge,i think this is great! old gay men are adorable! like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
62317,Marge,"bart, this could be a good new school... oakwood academy! huh?"
62285,Marge,"so, you still think i'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings?"
66991,Marge,hey homie. did you try the punch?
64366,Marge,"well, it seems real to me."
59677,Marge,"well, like all americans, fast."
60563,Marge,"now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on."
67928,Marge,"it's getting less and less likely you're going to yell ""surprise"" and have all my friends jump out..."
57825,Marge,"hello, dear. how was work at the plant?"
54594,Marge,i'm afraid it's top ramen again.
61977,Marge,"i had a feeling you'd say that. so i prepared something that might help you ""change your tune."""
54910,Marge,if you eat too much you'll have nightmares.
55920,Marge,you changed your grade with a computer?
59045,Marge,"lisa, did anyone force you to come here today?"
56354,Marge,"well, kids, i tried. maybe you're right."
55168,Marge,"homer, that's awful!"
63012,Marge,"the letter doesn't say. but from now on, no peanut products are allowed on school property."
61191,Marge,my baby!
59483,Marge,"homie, for god's sakes, it's two a.m."
61598,Marge,no! you're not going to take my baby to jail!
62102,Marge,"hold still, homie."
58696,Marge,you're guarding the mayor tonight? after fat tony swore revenge?
56176,Marge,"bart, this isn't the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with mr. burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. this could provide for your entire future."
59208,Marge,i'll repress the rage i'm feeling.
66700,Marge,"how was your first day at school, bart?"
59561,Marge,"well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
60062,Marge,"excuse me, hobo. can you play something a little less unnerving?"
65725,Marge,no one was laughing. you kept it a secret!
58850,Marge,"outta my way, nature!"
60486,Marge,"well, look who the fates dragged in."
59542,Marge,"hey, dig that crazy rhythm."
62796,Marge,"finally, we shall bid goodbye to england and its drunken, decadent sinners."
54605,Marge,i wish you would support my comments.
60995,Marge,"lisa, springfield isn't a cultural wasteland. part of ""stroker ace"" was filmed at our airport. and, um, oh! there's our ladies' book club. sara, you're more than welcome to come."
65293,Marge,my daughter's a vegetarian.
60014,Marge,it was an accident!
58888,Marge,i don't want a cellular transmitter sticking out of my roof!
57629,Marge,"oh, i can see myself!"
55488,Marge,"homer, what's wrong?"
63187,Marge,three years is a long ways away.
54724,Marge,that was our wedding.
56017,Marge,i don't know if this is a good idea.
54824,Marge,"now homer, don't panic. you have plenty of white shirts."
64940,Marge,"homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. it's twenty-five years old."
58424,Marge,mmm.
55976,Marge,what's so special about it?
67408,Marge,i wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
58666,Marge,that's a keeper!
64104,Marge,i feel like we're forgetting something.
62679,Marge,that was the most horrible part of all!
65282,Marge,that's toothpaste!
63330,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie -- i want to snuggle, but i'm just not feeling it."
65761,Marge,"no, our state."
56735,Marge,"homer, hold on to the wheel!"
67435,Marge,look! the crosstown bridge!
55818,Marge,"society's loss, i suppose. but our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
65982,Marge,what did he do now?
58955,Marge,"really? well, what do you call that thing on the branch?"
67694,Marge,"well, i don't think you're my type."
63519,Marge,he hasn't been home in four days.
61935,Marge,we've gotta go now!
64285,Marge,come and get me.
59595,Marge,usurper! usurper! usurper!
56452,Marge,"i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. how about letting her ride up front, too?"
60212,Marge,"water, eh?"
64106,Marge,"bart, if you hate belgium so much, maybe i should take your tintins away!"
64868,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
58790,Marge,"you're a lifesaver, apu. all the other stores are closed."
67180,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
59362,Marge,he hit the star player!
55935,Marge,"i don't hate you, i'm proud of you. you came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
58006,Marge,he's the only coach this team has ever had. and the season hasn't even started yet.
60628,Marge,"chief wiggum, homer and i are innocent."
64909,Marge,"huh? oh, myself, i guess."
62840,Marge,"don't be so naïve, lisa. those people all talk to each other!"
57724,Marge,whooh...
62039,Marge,fresh fr-fr-fresh for mommy's baby boy
57897,Marge,those were the days.
60570,Marge,"no, you're angry. look, you're punching the cat right now."
54796,Marge,"i don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
55393,Marge,"you know, i spend all day alone with maggie... and sometimes it's like i don't even exist."
66815,Marge,"here's what you do. you just take his hand, look in his eyes and say ""i don't want to be with you anymore."""
60651,Marge,i don't care what they say. i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
57868,Marge,"wow, governor's island looks so insignificant from up here."
60876,Marge,eight...
61889,Marge,"well, i'm glad everything worked out so well."
62756,Marge,what's with the kimono? are we having lachoy?
65736,Marge,"you've been in public education a long time, haven't you?"
62841,Marge,untidy! untidy! untidy!
63443,Marge,"we're all so proud of you, sweetie."
67946,Marge,what a fun quest! aren't you glad i made you take that nap in the middle?
61381,Marge,"oh, it's very wise. it's written by a rabbi -- who surfs!"
63393,Marge,"homer, can you breathe?!"
57895,Marge,because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them.
56977,Marge,"kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest. it's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave."
57429,Marge,i'm so sorry. how can i ever make this up to you?
67690,Marge,"""bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. now, the more you help him... the more you hurt him."""
62836,Marge,strangers getting married?! i wouldn't miss it for the world!
67233,Marge,who is this?
66786,Marge,"homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday."
59813,Marge,"oh jack, that's so soulful. how did someone so sensitive end up here?"
65119,Marge,thank you! this is my third favorite reality cooking show!
55150,Marge,i need a vacation.
58925,Marge,so many doorbells... i'm in way over my head.
57551,Marge,it would be nice to beat those women at their own game. maybe i should look into a franchise.
58736,Marge,"well, what are we waiting for?"
59724,Marge,"well, i sure don't feel like cooking."
62752,Marge,"yes, i could really picture him. with curly shoes. and smoke all over the place. you're a born storyteller."
56829,Marge,"bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
62873,Marge,have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?
61267,Marge,"homie, i don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here."
58781,Marge,i don't want to be chesty larue or busty st. claire!
63421,Marge,we're gonna have to run. there isn't even time to stretch my quads!
66926,Marge,cash?
64142,Marge,cue the band.
66967,Marge,"there, there, homer. you'll find a job. you've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back."
57628,Marge,"my, she seems too good to be true."
57316,Marge,i don't think you should. let lisa be alone with her new friends.
60699,Marge,"homie, it's five p.m. we're having dinner."
67782,Marge,"telephone, homer."
55329,Marge,"bart, what's going on?"
64925,Marge,"it's close, but no."
65918,Marge,why would you think i'd like this?
57442,Marge,"bart, company's coming. go put doilies under the coasters. hurry! hurry!"
60631,Marge,go away!
59125,Marge,tommy lee...
56375,Marge,this year i want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
65351,Marge,"moe, it's me, marge! i'm your friend!"
55302,Marge,i do.
55662,Marge,it's not good for your heart.
65913,Marge,i'm not hungry. goodnight.
62783,Marge,"well, i had my doubts, but grampa sure looks manly in those leggings!"
64577,Marge,"oh homie, you're alive!"
65459,Marge,purple!
64279,Marge,guess who the garden club elected president?
64222,Marge,homie?
63347,Marge,i wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
59986,Marge,"stay in the boat, homer."
58398,Marge,"i know, honey. but this is a very unusual situation... at least it would be for most families."
64121,Marge,hello?
58698,Marge,"remember how excited we were when this place opened? then a week later, we just forgot about it."
59920,Marge,don't you mean blocko shirt?
56154,Marge,i think you'll find that escape is impossible. now each one of you take a floor and get started.
60832,Marge,"uh, bob... i know you're enjoying fall preview week, but i was wondering if you made any progress towards finding homer's killer?"
56625,Marge,"homer, what if this doesn't work?"
57446,Marge,are you ready?
63624,Marge,when is straightman gonna pop the question?
58596,Marge,"yes, we'll go to the darn lake! now go back to bed. it's four a.m.!"
62173,Marge,"dear mr. gehry: would you please build a concert hall for our town? we may not be the biggest city, or the prettiest, but we were the first city in america to abandon the metric system!"
59359,Marge,"homer, maybe i should drive."
65203,Marge,d'artagnan wasn't a musketeer! he only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
61322,Marge,you can sleep on the couch tonight.
66216,Marge,"oh, i'm so sorry."
57134,Marge,"grampa, i know in your day spanking was common, but homer and i just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
65689,Marge,then to save us... we need something incredibly unnatural!
58832,Marge,"oopsie. mm, this could take a minute."
56305,Marge,how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
66499,Marge,"well, i don't miss his nonsense. there's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that i'm starting to suspect was him."
67317,Marge,"'bye, now. be good. gotta go."
63619,Marge,maybe i'll just hit the showers.
56699,Marge,making out the jury list for the film festival. mayor quimby -- krusty -- jay --
59523,Marge,that's south dakota.
55484,Marge,oh dear. it would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
56107,Marge,"lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
58116,Marge,$300 for doing nothing?! i feel like such a crook.
60755,Marge,not feeling well. going to bed. dinner and breakfast are on the table.
58186,Marge,looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
66305,Marge,/
54786,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
55852,Marge,i think you might like this... it's about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident...
55283,Marge,have you kissed her?
57623,Marge,"well, i'd like to hear your suggestions."
64798,Marge,this was my bedroom! my bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!
62812,Marge,what'd you call me?
64239,Marge,the year was 1588.
65605,Marge,"homer... homer, this is the point where i really have to know what you want."
59899,Marge,"oh. oh, i'd do anything."
61577,Marge,homer?
67344,Marge,bring the television up. bart's got his vision back!
62717,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. i never thought this would happen."
63558,Marge,"um, what are we doing here?"
59076,Marge,"oh my goodness, homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars."
61126,Marge,"homie, where have you been? i've been calling all over for you!"
55387,Marge,we miss you terribly. i hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
64958,Marge,there's a woman who's got it all under control.
58083,Marge,"yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. you know, i've always loved the house you're in now."
63787,Marge,"all right, i've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing."
66324,Marge,i heard that!
59927,Marge,"yeah, but what can you do?"
58290,Marge,simpson gene? that's just foolishness.
65883,Marge,splatter?
66065,Marge,tell me more.
63025,Marge,"homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
64048,Marge,"no, sweetie. at this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. who was i to think you could mail an envelope?"
56379,Marge,"homer, no. you're going to get lost."
67395,Marge,ewww.
67913,Marge,"and this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""murphy brown."""
56747,Marge,"homer, homer find a place for all these little miracles."
63797,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
59546,Marge,the furnace?
61941,Marge,"well, looking at you kids, i know i made the right choice in life."
61561,Marge,okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
57202,Marge,seven hundred dollars.
61049,Marge,"homer, no scissors!"
59328,Marge,i think that's an arm rest.
65402,Marge,"mona, you're alive?!"
54980,Marge,what are your son's hobbies?
55804,Marge,"honey, you look fine."
55315,Marge,"oooh, there's krusty the clown! krusty, krusty, say something funny."
65730,Marge,"you're a good man, homer simpson."
55179,Marge,"oh, i don't know..."
62254,Marge,"okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
56682,Marge,"no, homie. you see. you see, this is the stuff i've been telling you about that you never see."
59693,Marge,when you spy a quarter in a pie...
65590,Marge,awww... eww... homie! we still have a chance!
57088,Marge,lisa's on the sleepy train / to rest her weary head / her ticket is a candy cane / made out of gingerbread.
57104,Marge,"i love you so much, my little bitty barty."
64246,Marge,all i have are some dry-cleaning coupons.
61166,Marge,i am so tired of that tautology.
54960,Marge,the kwik-e-mart.
59488,Marge,"maybe you should see a doctor, homie. a head doctor."
63832,Marge,my son's a good-for-something!
65316,Marge,"well, during the town meeting, which now seems like years ago, i forgot my purse at your bar...and when i came back to get it, i saw how much you love that rag."
67595,Marge,but i like that statue.
58969,Marge,"oh no, it's the apocalypse. bart, are you wearing clean underwear?"
62014,Marge,i said stop
61317,Marge,isn't it kind of dry?
58520,Marge,one reward coming up. ta-da!
64628,Marge,"that's not sesame street, that's a gay bar."
56083,Marge,homer!
57708,Marge,just stand still and i'll get someone!
66063,Marge,i thought i was buying snack cakes!
61947,Marge,"maybe when the tooth fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized you're not a little boy anymore. so she gave you a grown-up gift."
58683,Marge,homer!
63412,Marge,kitty cat!
58299,Marge,"come on, maggie, let's try and find the enormous pendulum."
66479,Marge,we need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
55314,Marge,bart! stop that.
66525,Marge,"don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. when you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
67232,Marge,"here, if you have any soul left, you'll need these. i know i will."
54892,Marge,"well, i can't defend everything he does. but let's face it, all bart and milhouse have is each other. they're too young for girls. and they're a popular target for bullies. and in the christmas pageant, they're always sheep. please, please, let them be friends!"
59882,Marge,i'm bart's partner.
60388,Marge,"okay, hold onto your hats. ""dear artie..."""
66829,Marge,restore! restore!
62942,Marge,"buck, i guess we can help you out. we'll start tomorrow!"
61025,Marge,"no, let's hear him out. he looks a little like walter mondale."
55375,Marge,"herb, i appreciate your generosity, but i don't need any gift from you."
57710,Marge,"oh, i do. i'm just a little concerned about the kids. maybe i should call."
61480,Marge,"homer, i don't need fancy things. and even if i did, this is the wrong way to get them."
59169,Marge,"i'm having a hard time seeing. homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?"
65216,Marge,i've got to save him!
58682,Marge,aren't you going to give him the last rites?
59799,Marge,let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole.
67570,Marge,"oh, please. all right. i'm trying to earn a living here. all right! stop! stop!"
60008,Marge,homer!
62052,Marge,jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion...
59994,Marge,i-i love what you've done with these poles.
66460,Marge,lucas.
65295,Marge,"homie, wake up."
65864,Marge,"i thought you might be cold, honey, so i put this chinchilla coat on you."
60520,Marge,he's so adorable. can we have another baby?
55453,Marge,your father is... resting.
56889,Marge,i don't think we'll ever know who did this. everyone in town's a suspect.
61461,Marge,"homie, they're beautiful. that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! i feel a swoon coming on... here it is!"
65458,Marge,"any place is fun if you're there with ""super lips."""
56544,Marge,hmm. that would have to be my first day of school.
61145,Marge,"gee, everything always works out for you."
55131,Marge,"homer, i think that chip's got enough dip on it."
65857,Marge,"your grandfather is not psycho! the only thing he's ""straight-up"" is loves you."
62322,Marge,"don't you touch bead one! homer, maybe we should be concerned. catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on friday..."
59054,Marge,"no, you weren't."
67901,Marge,"homer, i've been talking to lisa and i'm concerned about your relationship with her."
61362,Marge,i guess no one gives a damn about the american family anymore.
61932,Marge,i don't see lisa in any of the seminars!
65004,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no -- i don't want the money back, i just came for my dog."
57774,Marge,but you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
55565,Marge,ow!
64923,Marge,"bart, sweetie..."
55943,Marge,uh... mr. hutz?
60403,Marge,"besides, i like some of the noises you make in bed."
54799,Marge,"oh, homie, you have lots of hair... why did you want to know your blood type?"
67800,Marge,maybe he just said that to make conversation.
54659,Marge,well i do.
67350,Marge,remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
56644,Marge,"homer, that's enough."
59509,Marge,"can i top you off, hon?"
63354,Marge,experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement!
60716,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie. it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock."
66912,Marge,"all right, children. let me have those letters. i'll send them to santa's workshop at the north pole."
55114,Marge,and don't make that face at me.
59846,Marge,"oh, chief! i found some evidence that points to the real arsonist."
62871,Marge,you're describing how to parallel park.
66909,Marge,...homer sends his love. happy holidays.
56891,Marge,i guess it's never the most likely suspect.
61310,Marge,they're not getting married!
60123,Marge,"homer, just take him to the bathroom."
60692,Marge,"homer, someone's in trouble!"
59507,Marge,a diner!?
65907,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
66329,Marge,why is it the recipe card you need is always the one homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
64174,Marge,"oh, bart, i don't care that this is just an act. you've finally become the boy every mother dreams of: a girl."
59979,Marge,"ooh, look, everybody!"
61171,Marge,just like real indians!
63420,Marge,american applesauce association?!
57034,Marge,we can always get more shoes! movemovemove!
58998,Marge,oh lord. what now?
66724,Marge,when will this tea get out of my system?
54827,Marge,"homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. i can't fill this out for you."
60962,Marge,darn it! i keep pouring juice for five.
61585,Marge,"i'm afraid what i like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
62334,Marge,first communion?!
58629,Marge,i feel guilty coming here every sunday and never actually buying anything.
65929,Marge,"are there any two words more exciting than ""couch shopping?"""
56359,Marge,"take me home, artie."
57298,Marge,"wave bye-bye to our house, maggie. bye-bye, tree."
61880,Marge,"nelson, what are you doing out this late?"
65948,Marge,"sorry maggie, i just don't have the touch today."
57222,Marge,"cheer up, homie."
56751,Marge,"well, it's just easier this way."
66965,Marge,what's going on up there?
66530,Marge,homer!
67121,Marge,homer?
60001,Marge,breakfast!
63367,Marge,"oooh, leather arms! people just give you this stuff?"
63153,Marge,"that's right! i just found my gumption, and i like it!"
67098,Marge,it's because of your irreverent attitude that bart thinks he can sneak headphones into sunday school.
66685,Marge,homer! turn off that horrible machine!
55994,Marge,"homer, stop that! it's just a weather station."
57719,Marge,why do you have so many bowling balls?
63298,Marge,whoa! look at those bazooms!
58654,Marge,don't look at me! i wanted to eat him!
65271,Marge,"sweetie, i've been waiting to hear you say that for so long. although you could've waited till morning..."
56498,Marge,hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
61766,Marge,some anniversary this is.
57695,Marge,you didn't remember that. you just saw it on tv.
67316,Marge,"here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining and the motel where we'll be spending the night. you'll have to put maggie to bed now. but bart and lisa can stay up for another hour. until then, they can watch a tape from our video library."
66369,Marge,sounds like that would take a while.
65787,Marge,"look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids?"
67846,Marge,homer?
59765,Marge,they always pick the guy with the wires.
60744,Marge,"now, i need some liposuction -- just enough to make me attractive to this man."
64682,Marge,we can enjoy each others' company.
62996,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
65540,Marge,wonderful stuff! enjoy it!
60164,Marge,oh.
56879,Marge,i have an idea.
66236,Marge,lisa? is everything okay?
61875,Marge,"now, i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt."
55658,Marge,"lisa, time for your feed --"
59684,Marge,and you'll lose weight?
65452,Marge,we sold it to pay for a family cruise!
67194,Marge,"goodbye, helen."
66508,Marge,"homie, i can't find my spatula! can you get another one?"
56732,Marge,"yes, the dog..."
57018,Marge,i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. you could get hurt again.
62748,Marge,"oh, how nice for her!"
62059,Marge,"so tell, tell. who's the lucky man? what does he do? let me guess: does he work in customer support?"
57599,Marge,bart? lisa?
57691,Marge,how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob?
59221,Marge,what is it? carrots? peas? maybe it's okra.
61485,Marge,maggie!
64685,Marge,"well, i don't need much help..."
55092,Marge,what are you doing to save my baby boy?
60380,Marge,"if i'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese quesadilla, i'm gonna scream."
63467,Marge,"oh homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus."
61622,Marge,"oh, that's so lovely. but it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
56271,Marge,bart...? are all these children friends of yours?
58464,Marge,you mean this thing?
64471,Marge,you like tomato...
59459,Marge,"aww, just like her mommy, maggie senior. so, what did everyone do today?"
66212,Marge,coming through! wife on a mission!
55716,Marge,"no honey, gladys looked more like your aunt patty."
65182,Marge,then i'll have that!
60329,Marge,"oh, all right. but take maggie with you."
60889,Marge,i can bench twice as much as when i started! and look at my abs!
64858,Marge,we're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day.
64293,Marge,"bart, let him go!"
59756,Marge,they're arresting him right now!
63102,Marge,"oh, stop. just stop. you don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!"
60849,Marge,"chief wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty."
67093,Marge,why should i feel like a traffic cop every sunday morning when i'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
56990,Marge,"hi. ah, er, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. did you put on a little weight this week?"
57887,Marge,"i'm sorry, but that's just how i feel."
61649,Marge,stupid kids ruin everything.
55468,Marge,"oh, homey! are you all right?"
54662,Marge,let go of him! what kind of jerk strangles a little boy?
66550,Marge,no. i think i went too far.
55999,Marge,stolen?!
55142,Marge,get out.
62237,Marge,"homer, no one has ever seen ray but you."
67521,Marge,"how'd it go, homer?"
64034,Marge,don't open this one again.
65561,Marge,but my car is down there!
66240,Marge,"it was a crazy time, the eighties."
63267,Marge,"okay, we're recreating our series finale party for ""star trek: voyager."""
57416,Marge,it's the light pink '87 wagon.
54830,Marge,i said crazy house!
57692,Marge,"bart, no!"
64778,Marge,roger was telling the truth!
59538,Marge,"ah, little vicki, i really think she had her heart set on..."
58462,Marge,clothes! we're saved!
64153,Marge,"homer, one thing i've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love."
54868,Marge,seventy-five dollars? ned must be desperate!
55792,Marge,bart!
55580,Marge,"so, do you think i have a case?"
56522,Marge,what if you pretended that this couch were a bar? then you could spend more nights at home with us. huh?
65105,Marge,chief wiggum! stop that train!
60044,Marge,"wow, three pairs of shoes. someone had a fetish."
55435,Marge,why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
61269,Marge,bart! stop saying macbeth!
67374,Marge,what on earth was that?
66734,Marge,are you okay?
66049,Marge,"well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. it's the cuffs that would be bigger. as for homer, i'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, dolly madison."
58527,Marge,yes?
66650,Marge,i don't understand you.
56047,Marge,still no help.
58232,Marge,"no, no, no. just the first two."
66783,Marge,"there's a yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
57817,Marge,homer...
62977,Marge,homer!
55814,Marge,you look familiar. have we met before?
62277,Marge,haircuts!
54903,Marge,yes.
66255,Marge,look at all these out-of-state license plates!
57582,Marge,"well, here i am -- 11905 dead weasel road, but i don't see any apartment building, i just --"
65074,Marge,"well, homer and i are going to take you away right now."
66795,Marge,we're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.
60605,Marge,my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
63049,Marge,i have to be honest with you -- i can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
64534,Marge,bart! put down those books and go play this instant!
58709,Marge,but there's only been one pitch!
56743,Marge,"hey, what did i just say?!!"
58272,Marge,here's $42 -- it's everything i have. run home and bury it in the yard.
64189,Marge,noah. i like that name. no-ahhh. noah. noah!
55558,Marge,"lisa, sh! someone may be listening."
62200,Marge,"and i'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea."
66144,Marge,"well, you are the best this circus has to offer..."
65654,Marge,"don't call satan! so what if the message wasn't a miracle? the answer isn't in syrup from god or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real."
57867,Marge,the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. we'll meet you in central park at five o'clock.
62743,Marge,he's a very impressive boy.
62239,Marge,electro-shock?
67017,Marge,"gee, i thought we were making real progress."
64232,Marge,"i got it halfway-- oh, it went back."
56810,Marge,"you got it, little buddy."
56929,Marge,it's maggie!
59805,Marge,"welcome to ""freeing the artist within."" not literally, of course."
63372,Marge,you're nothing but a diabolical master thief. the kind that haunts the slopes of san moritz or the casinos of monte carlo.
61384,Marge,you should be glad i did. your father wanted to call you bartzeena!
56071,Marge,no.
56473,Marge,"oh, well thank you homer. but take one of the kids."
56437,Marge,"i don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. awful, awful hair."
66533,Marge,"mm, hm."
61830,Marge,what a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say. now i've got to get ready for the finals.
60963,Marge,i think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
58948,Marge,oooo. what a beautiful garden. it's almost like paradise.
57649,Marge,bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
56935,Marge,we've never been separated from the kids for so long. i don't know how much more i can take.
62778,Marge,"grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
56713,Marge,"well, jay, i hope you tell your new york friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
62721,Marge,"while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp, i was raising my son. you have no right to take him away from me now. please, please, give me back my boy."
56217,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
56048,Marge,yes.
59031,Marge,"ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
61773,Marge,why is my swimsuit so revealing?
61704,Marge,i got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
64117,Marge,and i think apu got lucky with my sister.
65700,Marge,and he didn't pee on the floor!
55932,Marge,"more cocoa, mr. burns?"
56059,Marge,"your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""the gong show."" and you did it in 1977, remember?"
62480,Marge,done and done!
55879,Marge,amazing!
63626,Marge,"well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed mount everest and got everyone else killed."
57105,Marge,"since i got my present early, i think you should get yours early too."
60303,Marge,"i want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
60842,Marge,"wow, this restaurant is so international. le pizza, der hamburger, señor grilled cheese... i hope i don't accidentally order an elephant."
64305,Marge,"we need to take this into the belly of the beast. mr. scalper, give me a ticket."
67477,Marge,"no, no, no, no, the other one."
54972,Marge,"homie, we're back."
55034,Marge,"well, that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club..."
60272,Marge,"we've got to do something, but what?"
57077,Marge,okay.
66782,Marge,"oh, sweetie..."
55275,Marge,you should have called. i was very worried.
56324,Marge,no.
64401,Marge,"homie, you're back!"
59894,Marge,no we're not. you're going down.
59271,Marge,it's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
55170,Marge,"hi, did you miss me?"
61657,Marge,and we're blowing off uncle tyrone's birthday!
64003,Marge,"these be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties."
61459,Marge,and that's the life of mozart. thank god he died young. i've gotta get dinner on the stove.
58157,Marge,i'm over here!
56886,Marge,he's causing us all to yell!
66496,Marge,"after thirty-five years of wifely obedience, i'm married to a face on a screen."
56027,Marge,shhh!
57526,Marge,we'll all be killed!
55908,Marge,would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
63398,Marge,all out! i can't make my famous raisin sponge-cake without raisins! kids love the zing of raisins!
63726,Marge,it's four o'clock on a saturday.
63070,Marge,what's with the lined composition book?
62180,Marge,haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
55338,Marge,so get that piece of paper!
61809,Marge,"well, open it, open it, open it!"
59082,Marge,family wish show... hmmm... that gives me an idea.
67166,Marge,"hm, very smooth."
67624,Marge,"...but, well, i guess he did miss three days of school --"
59953,Marge,she got it open.
55813,Marge,i have no idea. unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
60733,Marge,dad left the milk out / yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck...
63773,Marge,i'm really worried about lurleen.
66253,Marge,"homer, you have to take the halloween decorations down before you put the christmas ones up."
60167,Marge,no! everyone should be paired up.
61510,Marge,"oh god, we're in a belly. everyone take off your shoes."
59442,Marge,don't panic! don't panic! don't panic!
64399,Marge,your perfectly-trimmed mustache...
61092,Marge,"shucks, lisa. you sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
63392,Marge,it says here don't bother naming them. snakes have poor hearing and only live to strangle.
63592,Marge,i guess you should judge a book by its cover.
60731,Marge,the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace! a mother knows!
67331,Marge,"so, i'm worried. i think we should go home."
62992,Marge,"he's gotta fall asleep sometime, doesn't he?"
60099,Marge,"bravo, pierce!"
57493,Marge,no! come on!
60039,Marge,could i have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
64664,Marge,thank you... you're very sweet...
56755,Marge,"rev. lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the regional director of the irs."
58647,Marge,"the water's boiling! quick, chuck him in!"
57500,Marge,"well, i just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
59479,Marge,"kids, the new phone books are here. and your picture's on the cover!"
61458,Marge,"as a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century europe..."
55059,Marge,oh dear...
61286,Marge,"oh, dear lord."
59707,Marge,"well, we couldn't be prouder."
61628,Marge,yeah! you don't need a husband to be happy!
65933,Marge,"i know this seems bad, but nothing brings out the best in springfield like a crisis..."
56387,Marge,you're sure she'll have fun here?
64575,Marge,but it says here in the brochure...
55187,Marge,"no, homer."
64988,Marge,"homer, i told you he wouldn't sleep through it."
55979,Marge,you already asked me that.
60045,Marge,"are you okay, ned?"
64804,Marge,"but it's not good enough, is it?"
64306,Marge,i'm marge simpson and i will not rest until you tear down this septagon!
60700,Marge,it's true. i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. i had to tell mr. burns you had violent diarrhea.
57909,Marge,"sorry, lisa. it's just how the story goes. no matter what bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school."
60006,Marge,no!
55084,Marge,"y'know bart, i don't think this is such a bad present. maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
57976,Marge,"homer, i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage."
56821,Marge,i just wanted to say hello.
66636,Marge,as many as you like...
56947,Marge,"uh, uh, uh, let me guess. a mother can always tell. hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. it almost feels like you're missing something. something important."
63414,Marge,um... um...
55967,Marge,hey wait!
58451,Marge,it's okay when you're in love. and married. to the sweetest guy in the world.
65279,Marge,"okay, everyone. smile while the pets take our picture."
59675,Marge,don't you two have a list of chores to do?
56411,Marge,"bart, i wish you wouldn't lie like that."
63511,Marge,"homer, where have you been?"
57325,Marge,you went into the attic? i'm very disappointed and terrified.
61744,Marge,i'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield.
64598,Marge,there's gotta be a clue here somewhere.
57343,Marge,all right.
65140,Marge,he had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
57574,Marge,here you go -- free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone! one bite and you'll be hooked!
67833,Marge,"homer, please. it's not just the quilt. he's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. he doesn't obey. he's not even housebroken. and we've spent all this money on an obedience school and i don't see any improvement."
62623,Marge,no!
62410,Marge,"i spy with my little eye, a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised."
54851,Marge,"lisa, the contest isn't for three hours."
56385,Marge,"oh, i see. all right. i'll have the baby guts."
61654,Marge,"you know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to miami!"
61761,Marge,"i think i'm going to like this ""america."""
55725,Marge,homer!
54618,Marge,he is!
58964,Marge,"oooh, that's a tight squeeze."
59709,Marge,maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
67014,Marge,arrrgh!
56576,Marge,"i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer."
57042,Marge,don't let the bedbugs bite.
67252,Marge,"well, going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but i think bart should have a say in this."
57812,Marge,"how about...""mitzi""?"
54648,Marge,you oppose marriage?
58765,Marge,you are invited to a garden party this saturday!
56029,Marge,"exactly! so from now on, i'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
66890,Marge,this is all my fault.
66158,Marge,he's such a little dickens. although dickens was pretty well-behaved.
55262,Marge,"homer get a-hold of yourself. even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. remember doggie heaven."
66708,Marge,"don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
59909,Marge,"hey, grampa's running!"
66611,Marge,my store. my offset spatula! mine!
56440,Marge,no. he looks like something might be disturbing him.
66105,Marge,leave me alone!
56702,Marge,yes.
58876,Marge,"looks like it's time for plan b. one, two, three, ""b""!"
54958,Marge,"he's just exhausted. lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
58178,Marge,that backyard is a disgrace. now get busy.
58884,Marge,what?
60857,Marge,"apu, where's your bathroom?"
56621,Marge,"what did you do today, bart?"
59685,Marge,"look, maggie. christopher walken's reading ""goodnight moon!"""
65482,Marge,head injury?! why didn't you tell me?
62892,Marge,i guess we have to move on.
59943,Marge,stop! stop!
65315,Marge,come on in!
56590,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah two. let's get to the baby pictures."
58739,Marge,"hmm, lisa, i don't want to alarm you, but i'm not finding any."
56115,Marge,i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
66153,Marge,"moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful."
63171,Marge,i was so happy on that island...
58470,Marge,"kids, i want to explain about the stadium. y'see, sometimes moms and dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other."
55251,Marge,"lisa, i'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of encyclopedia generica from the grocery store."
66583,Marge,this has got to stop! if you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
67149,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
57436,Marge,hello marge. how's the family? i don't want to talk about it. mind your own business.
65849,Marge,"okay, post this under ""men seeking men,"" but what sub-heading... nothing too serious... here we go -- ""casual encounters!"" perfect, no pressure!"
62206,Marge,it means you have to fix the roof!
59823,Marge,"warden, please. this man is a gentle soul. i know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. not behind bars."
56503,Marge,we need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
66409,Marge,"well, we've talked about it, and if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract."
64991,Marge,at some point i think we should see a doctor.
60788,Marge,so... when can we go back in our house?
57741,Marge,"that's laddie. bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over."
58563,Marge,"oh, am i in the way?"
55730,Marge,are you sure you've thought this through? a child can really change your life.
61738,Marge,i think you should stay home from school tomorrow.
66457,Marge,"first, mazel tov! second, don't! please, please, i'm a mother. surely you have a mother too."
56203,Marge,hmm?
60659,Marge,"hold your heads up high, kids."
65886,Marge,"why'd you do it, willie?"
63394,Marge,"if someone did eat bart's shorts, they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage!"
56558,Marge,i was a little girl...
63550,Marge,damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!
59067,Marge,are you going through our garbage?
64629,Marge,"although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring, but... we're going home."
59712,Marge,"hmm. well, i'm proud of you. you're such a good provider. kids, come on -- thank your father for the injections!"
59363,Marge,"a field goal? hm... nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... that would win the game!"
66377,Marge,"darn it, they're stuck."
64379,Marge,garden view?
62050,Marge,which book?
59418,Marge,"now homey, you know, ned and the boys need us. and you know what that means."
64437,Marge,who wants fresh donuts?
65969,Marge,yes. 'cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. like the one pair of blue pants i bought homer twenty years ago.
65367,Marge,wanna make out over the foul line?
66046,Marge,"oooohhh, i'm going to hell!"
60548,Marge,uh-oh.
56287,Marge,"oh, for chri..."
55032,Marge,what if we get caught?
64569,Marge,"well, we will take you up on your offer."
56128,Marge,pride?
67099,Marge,"now, move it!"
63542,Marge,"okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
62948,Marge,maybe we should stop here.
54948,Marge,"homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
57988,Marge,"honey, it'll be morning soon. try and get some sleep."
67638,Marge,my name is marge.
58170,Marge,"well, let's get eatin'."
63500,Marge,crie? what does that stand for?
67191,Marge,"oh... yes, hello, helen."
58940,Marge,"no, but if you'll just ring the--"
67356,Marge,he sounds good. hire him.
56667,Marge,"patty, selma. what are you doing here?"
64995,Marge,see?
63800,Marge,"homie, she's not making a snuggle film."
61994,Marge,moe and i are going to the tavern and restaurant owners convention in aruba this weekend. don't you ever listen to me? i told you ten times.
65894,Marge,can you chew with your mouth closed? it's like looking into a garbage disposal.
59652,Marge,"son, i don't like you watching that fire. it's too violent."
59841,Marge,"now wait, you don't know that jack did this. just because he's an ex-con..."
62868,Marge,"i'm sorry. you seem like... a colorful character, but i just don't remember you."
64430,Marge,that's us!
67456,Marge,i wish this family was as close as the flanders.
62596,Marge,here's a cute fact. this sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
58388,Marge,"don't worry, kids. your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those sherpas."
55984,Marge,"i said, no."
66299,Marge,"i didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
64375,Marge,cuddling's for after.
59750,Marge,"oh, this? hmm. i think it is."
61048,Marge,"ooh, look how late it is. let's get you kids some coffee."
65589,Marge,you never told me about that.
62120,Marge,that's right. it's much less expensive than the leading clown-based cereal. you just have to assemble it yourself.
58946,Marge,"i'm really sorry, everybody, but i've tried everything. i'm afraid we're just going to have to learn to live with it."
60466,Marge,the home told us you were dead.
57321,Marge,"remember, kids, there's no need to bump! just enjoy the ride!"
63718,Marge,"out of the house, kids! i have to make an adult phone call."
55991,Marge,i hit it! i hit it!
56039,Marge,i knew it. if only i had nagged more...
67648,Marge,there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street.
60772,Marge,eighty-nine percent of americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.
63495,Marge,"come on, sweetie. everyone's going to sleep."
60494,Marge,"joan, renounce your faith! save yourself!"
61639,Marge,"we're staying at the dayton arms hotel. it got three diamonds from ""five diamond"" magazine!"
63056,Marge,"homer, with all the things you've done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the navy -- i never thought you'd join the army!"
57624,Marge,homer!
62145,Marge,"lights out, weirdoes!"
63629,Marge,really? but i'm so used to my old one.
66396,Marge,"well, thanks for the chicken dinner. how did you know i wanted one?"
56926,Marge,can you see them?
56838,Marge,"look, lisa. it's mcgriff the crime dog."
57928,Marge,balzac!
64168,Marge,"all right, homer. let's see what my baby's been up to."
61631,Marge,"oh, it's very sweet, but i don't need..."
55386,Marge,"dear kids, i hope this letter finds you well. we are doing great. your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever."
66304,Marge,ask body spray!
65670,Marge,ooo! hygiene!
65161,Marge,the kids sure had a good time with you.
61188,Marge,all i wanted was to glue feathers on felt and teach the boys good citizenship. and now it's a donnybrook!
56165,Marge,bart!!!
67770,Marge,i want you to find a husband for my sister selma.
62571,Marge,"bye, ladies. you can text-message me any time."
65486,Marge,"so, how many more weeks do you have off?"
65098,Marge,"well, maggie, one key left for us!"
56035,Marge,bart! be quiet!
66415,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's beautiful! i've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
55706,Marge,"mr. kobb, what can we do?"
58804,Marge,maybe we should leave.
55226,Marge,"oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. but deep down, you know you love the saxophone. i think you should stay in the band."
59521,Marge,"dang, i wish i could. but in august, our chain gang has to dig for tar."
55608,Marge,"hi, homie. it's really starting to snow. i think you should come home."
62830,Marge,"yes, unless..."
56494,Marge,"well, we can dress it up a bit. we can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... and the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
59532,Marge,"that's wonderful, honey. we should ask your father, though. where is he, anyway?"
65277,Marge,the contractions?
58531,Marge,"we need bart to help fold your father's underpants. where is he, anyway?"
57402,Marge,"and the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--"
67367,Marge,"oh, homer. your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
56194,Marge,"homer, i want that thing out of my house."
65815,Marge,"look, maggie! they have a story lady!"
66940,Marge,"this is the best gift of all, homer."
67618,Marge,do you know what i'd settle for if it was up to me? bart's medical bills and an apology!
67416,Marge,i don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
54783,Marge,did you make any money?
62786,Marge,"homie, i got you something to read on the plane."
66622,Marge,"no! no, no, no! it was me that couldn't get to--"
57677,Marge,"homer, i don't think there's a problem with bart. but if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. goodnight."
54943,Marge,let's be realistic. a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
58279,Marge,"homer, did you really steal a car?"
64640,Marge,we're breaking up!
58125,Marge,what happened?
61721,Marge,"homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant."
67505,Marge,"now, come on, you two. what time does your little truck game start?"
60387,Marge,"well, i suppose i could write him a letter..."
65391,Marge,it's kind of embarrassing...
64237,Marge,"a woman can be smart, beautiful and powerful. like queen elizabeth the first! she had it all, except the most important thing."
58138,Marge,that was close.
54609,Marge,"homer, your music is so angry and bitter."
59974,Marge,who's muntu?
67665,Marge,"""... soon the rain will fall / my dear one is departing/ but first please heed this call / that always will i love you / my one, my love, my all."""
55451,Marge,i'm tired of having this argument every sunday. get dressed.
61506,Marge,i hope this typeface catches people's eye. it sure didn't move our old fondue set!
65099,Marge,this looks like it's from a wind-up toy.
58044,Marge,"hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
64633,Marge,"i don't want to get homer in trouble, but it's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a mecca of misdemeanors!"
63818,Marge,i'm used to buying my critters pre-made. how does your store differ?
62806,Marge,good times.
66124,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
62401,Marge,"oh, wait a minute. there's no batteries in this thing."
61824,Marge,i guess i was the last one.
62643,Marge,fine.
63034,Marge,"homer, it's time people knew the truth: i'm doing the work and i want the credit."
65817,Marge,"homie, help me find them."
64715,Marge,"lisa, look!"
65487,Marge,"also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!"
60233,Marge,a little much.
60097,Marge,"pierce, that was delicious. can we help you with the dishes?"
59481,Marge,"actually, i took the picture, so i gave my prize to the orphanage."
60095,Marge,"well, hello pierce!"
58142,Marge,stop that!
58194,Marge,how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
58076,Marge,"thank you. thank you, everybody. i'm going to do my darndest to uphold the principles and ideals this jacket represents."
55894,Marge,"bart, i'm going to get you..."
59475,Marge,so how was your ride with barney?
67921,Marge,why?
58525,Marge,you stay away from nelson muntz.
67115,Marge,"no, homer. it's mine."
63534,Marge,"homer, i have to go. if i don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
66187,Marge,"i'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
63076,Marge,"lisa, i'm sorry you got a bad grade on your ""moe and tell."""
58183,Marge,what?!
61456,Marge,"c'mon, bart -- we can make this fun. history's like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize."
60868,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'll come right out and help you."
67859,Marge,"i think it's a very nice idea. don't you, homer?"
59164,Marge,you always liked my pork chops.
64545,Marge,"i don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!"
66217,Marge,"if he's not in there, where is he?"
59782,Marge,"homer, get up! up, up, up!"
67314,Marge,you must be the babysitter.
60611,Marge,college is no place for a young girl with those quadrangles and study carrels and syllabi...
61643,Marge,the sweet love story that is older than the sea...
55631,Marge,"guess what, homie... there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now."
67565,Marge,substantially-less
55790,Marge,uh... not to my knowledge.
58134,Marge,people saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
63914,Marge,scrubbing you / is easy 'cause you've been pre-rinsed / and when you're covered with goo / that's when i'm scrubbing you! / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub...
59178,Marge,no.
67165,Marge,oh. well... all right. when do we start?
58097,Marge,"the first house i have to show you is, uhm, a handyman's dream."
55465,Marge,"kids, could you wait outside for us?"
64725,Marge,why wouldn't i?
58533,Marge,"nelson?! i explicitly forbade bart from playing with that little monster. ooo, bart is in deep, deep trouble."
59025,Marge,"fine. if we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. i wrote another poem about a duck."
66215,Marge,where is he?
64977,Marge,true beauty isn't about hair color?
58870,Marge,"i'd like to help you, chief, but my license was revoked. seems i'm full of rage."
67818,Marge,"i didn't know then, and i don't know now."
59055,Marge,"lisa, thank god you're okay."
57866,Marge,"homer, you're scaring the children."
56831,Marge,"don't stop talking on account of me. i may be a cop, but i'm still your friend."
57064,Marge,"well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
60648,Marge,homer!
56209,Marge,"homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake."
57210,Marge,"boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? i'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't i? huh? huh?"
56518,Marge,you threw them out the window in a fit of passion. you said you were never going to need them again.
56206,Marge,give me those...
63936,Marge,but i can't take a dress from a man who looks so good and smells so clean.
55535,Marge,"homer, do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper?"
67112,Marge,"homer, did you have something to do with this?"
58133,Marge,homer! you won't believe what's happened! it's a miracle!
62798,Marge,"good sir, i do not approve of your fleshly gaze."
56848,Marge,"oh, that's it. i'm gonna write you a ticket."
56160,Marge,then stop screaming so loud.
55326,Marge,i meant a real guitar.
62898,Marge,"i still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, i wish i did... homer."
64288,Marge,yes!
67925,Marge,"i keep telling you, ghost sex is nothing. it's worse than nothing."
60873,Marge,i do!
60047,Marge,"ned, i'm worried about you. you've been working non-stop for the past week."
59655,Marge,what?! you threw our precious babies into the woods?! we could have sold them!
64677,Marge,"ooo, everyone's coming over to congratulate us! humble faces, kids!"
58050,Marge,"it's wednesday, homer."
56865,Marge,"oh, homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
64655,Marge,water feature...
65774,Marge,homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?
61431,Marge,oh homie!
65485,Marge,the guy from the movie?
63587,Marge,"oh, what a wonderful night."
57564,Marge,don't forget fat people. they can't stop eating!
58047,Marge,"please, lisa. i don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but i really wish we could make peace before sunset."
56579,Marge,"homer, a man who called himself ""you know who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter."
55538,Marge,oh my lord!
61394,Marge,you work at the nuclear plant.
55615,Marge,no. no. could you wear the mr. plow jacket. just uh... for fun.
59203,Marge,"we're fine, colonel. good day."
56801,Marge,"ah, i think i'm okay. it was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
65738,Marge,a pillowcase full of quarters?! where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
64604,Marge,"bart? bart, are you here?"
59741,Marge,i'm right here!
58107,Marge,"look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the flanders will be."
55903,Marge,we've left it all behind. how can you make a clean break with your life?
60166,Marge,it's about time mr. burns found a woman. i can't stand to see a man single.
61934,Marge,she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? that's it! she is off the christmas card list.
60549,Marge,"homer, you're doing drugs!"
54832,Marge,crazy house!
59149,Marge,stop him! he's wacked out of his gourd.
64883,Marge,"so, this stuff will just shampoo out, huh?"
55965,Marge,"sure, homer. trapped in vending machines. okay."
55443,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. by the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up."
65578,Marge,"homie, i want another baby."
61259,Marge,"yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
56031,Marge,i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
55746,Marge,"homer, we're going to my sisters'! remember, pick up bart!"
60906,Marge,i feel good... with no repercussions!
67496,Marge,and i said he ruined thanksgiving...
58855,Marge,nobody will ever cut me off again!
58689,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake."
62194,Marge,"lisa, your date's here!"
61747,Marge,i can't believe they put us in jail.
63833,Marge,it's clown trouble. that's your responsibility.
58208,Marge,we can't just give up our home. there's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.
59187,Marge,there goes the clothesline.
56855,Marge,homer!
64110,Marge,come back here!
64446,Marge,"homie, i'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people..."
60610,Marge,"bart, don't slurp your soup."
61716,Marge,it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes.
58080,Marge,no.
66775,Marge,"you're the last vote, homie."
56079,Marge,"lisa's costume. homer, i didn't realize. i'm so sorry."
62749,Marge,that sounds horrible.
62496,Marge,"bart, how'd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom?"
61513,Marge,just tell her which friggin' button to push!
60705,Marge,so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
56520,Marge,you didn't want to have bart.
61729,Marge,"no, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
61454,Marge,"no, it's a sacagawea dollar. you can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar! eh?"
60851,Marge,"oh thank you, sweetie."
64450,Marge,"okay, who's ready for a wedding-theme knock-knock joke?"
64543,Marge,you were never going to apologize!
60551,Marge,hello?
61964,Marge,stop making a scene!
55649,Marge,"bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib."
64952,Marge,and a completely new hairstyle!
61207,Marge,"now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
65344,Marge,now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
57387,Marge,i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening.
55192,Marge,where's maggie? where's maggie?
60397,Marge,pretty much. yeah.
66803,Marge,yes.
64267,Marge,henry the fifth... titus andronicus...
62189,Marge,oooh. smile!
66009,Marge,a proud mother always does.
65222,Marge,what? they've got a point.
62781,Marge,"grampa, killing yourself is a sin! god wants us to die of old age, after years of pain and reduced mobility!"
60445,Marge,i guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
63802,Marge,"ooo, ""candyland."" a great family game is now a great family movie!"
61401,Marge,that painting has always sparked my imagination.
63216,Marge,"aw, grampa. we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can."
63168,Marge,this is so exciting -- watching a movie outside with the whole town.
61279,Marge,englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
66502,Marge,"look, life's tough. it's hard to make it through. the only way i know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it."
63679,Marge,but it comes from a true place...
58770,Marge,"eh, maybe later."
55348,Marge,don't you usually play with milhouse after school?
62133,Marge,my scrimpings!
61131,Marge,"kids, hurry up and eat! we have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago!"
59075,Marge,i'd like to see the japanese take on the club sandwich. i bet it's smaller and more efficient!
61365,Marge,that wasn't me!
60652,Marge,"homer, this is all your fault. if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa, none of this would have happened."
57201,Marge,"checking accounts aren't really for children, bart."
59206,Marge,then why are you driving so fast?
62423,Marge,"sweetie, we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have."
63332,Marge,who would do this to bart?
61304,Marge,"how about jon stewart? he's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
54858,Marge,"we can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --"
57311,Marge,you'll be my friend. i'm never gonna let you get away.
61330,Marge,"well, maggie likes roofi. and babies only like good things."
65805,Marge,this so-called educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!
66828,Marge,what?!
57110,Marge,"no, i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
55422,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face!
61885,Marge,"bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
67954,Marge,hold that thought.
65957,Marge,homer simpson!
63073,Marge,"homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives."
56993,Marge,normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on tv. but this season...
55823,Marge,homie! you're all right!
57657,Marge,nooo. it's an heirloom my grandmother passed down to me -- a very rare old figurine from the civil war.
55623,Marge,"according to 'fretful mother' magazine, if maggie doesn't talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender."
61966,Marge,"homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement."
54630,Marge,it's true! and we'll all live in cities on the moon.
63166,Marge,"the only house i'm interested in is my own, which you defiled for eleven hellish months. but now i've learned to say ""no!"" no to your mooching! no to your manipulation! and a big fat no to the kingsbridge school district!"
64825,Marge,there we go. clean... and white... and soft.
55472,Marge,that is so sweet.
58987,Marge,"that's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if i, i don't know, entered a belching contest?"
55718,Marge,"oh homer, quit pouting."
67898,Marge,"lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that i feel that way about your father!"
60137,Marge,"i just can't do that, homer. it's a matter of principle. and i need you to support me in this."
59197,Marge,"oh, homer, i bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up."
62978,Marge,"i've tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies."
60141,Marge,"if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
62718,Marge,i am not an unfit mother!
66987,Marge,"well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. i don't want to alarm anyone, but i think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch."
67140,Marge,hm. well... all right.
63428,Marge,tell me later!
59099,Marge,"of course, homey. aren't you thinking about me?"
55864,Marge,mr. hutz! this was all a misunderstanding. i didn't mean to take anything.
61248,Marge,"lisa, you look so successful. like you're the wife of a businessman."
62091,Marge,wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
65143,Marge,just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
59888,Marge,"darling, you're so much handsomer than my first husband."
62997,Marge,"look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
60416,Marge,"marge, if you're watching this, then it means i've figured out how to work the camera. last night i crashed a certain fake prom. that's right, artie ziff's fake prom."
60614,Marge,"homer, cathy is a woman."
59302,Marge,talk to him. use your words.
62919,Marge,"well, i might as well see what all the fuss is about."
56495,Marge,there are only forty-nine stars on that flag.
64652,Marge,"homer, no!"
56445,Marge,"homer, stop that. i believe him."
59599,Marge,"this isn't over, becky. i know where you live: my house!"
65102,Marge,"i'll call you back! come back, pooter toot! people might be offended by your mild tastelessness!"
63853,Marge,a sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
64427,Marge,that's right! it is!
56995,Marge,"you're right. maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice. homer? homer! homer! that's it. that's the one. all right, send him on in."
66911,Marge,"oh, for heavens sakes, homer. it's in the utility drawer."
58917,Marge,"no, homer! don't fill up on bread!"
66314,Marge,now!
64523,Marge,"i don't know what the big deal is. i mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's french. you know, bouvier?"
57927,Marge,i cannot believe this. i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
60223,Marge,"oh, that's sensible."
62738,Marge,"so, charles, what do you do for a living?"
62692,Marge,"...uh, hmm, let's see, uh just a second uhh... oh, yeah sure, i'd be happy to baby-sit for rod and todd."
58845,Marge,"oh, crud. and we're so close to the house."
65139,Marge,he's not a bad boy.
56212,Marge,uh-oh.
61244,Marge,i'm so proud of you lisa.
62403,Marge,noooo!
62539,Marge,don't call me mother! my name is mom! and my son is no mama's boy!
54723,Marge,"homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. there's a little girl upstairs who needs you. her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her daddy."
59865,Marge,as far as i know.
64021,Marge,your father's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school.
57530,Marge,bad fawn! hmm. shoo! shoo!
60537,Marge,that's baby corn.
56487,Marge,"homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. it's not gonna happen."
56046,Marge,homer!
61071,Marge,"yes, homie?"
67702,Marge,why is there make-out music on?
59633,Marge,stop it!
61755,Marge,does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
59589,Marge,"why do i always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""shut up, becky!"" ooh, that would've been sweet."
60582,Marge,how did you find out?
66623,Marge,"homie, i'm a little worried. do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
62909,Marge,"oh, and there's a familiar name. and another one. wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? did he get married?"
58048,Marge,"well, i guess you were right, honey. but you have to admit, when that angel started to talk, you were squeezing my hand pretty hard."
61099,Marge,"homer, those are elk."
62995,Marge,look! bart's onstage... and he's contributing to the entertainment!
66227,Marge,late night at moe's eh?
60369,Marge,so many dings.
55379,Marge,"it's our last family dinner for six weeks, but i promised myself i wouldn't cry."
64587,Marge,"really? okay, eat your lunch."
61026,Marge,but i didn't do anything.
56792,Marge,"ah, c'mon, homer, there's lasers. you like lasers."
55828,Marge,"gee, that's odd. they didn't send one to you."
59660,Marge,"oh honey, i wouldn't say doomed. it's gonna be an adjustment, no question..."
57662,Marge,he is quite a charmer. your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
59341,Marge,talk to me.
66744,Marge,one night. the one night of the year i want homer home with his family and he can't even do that.
61300,Marge,dr. hibbert? is someone seriously ill?
56034,Marge,brad goodman is coming to town!
63475,Marge,i want you to stop flirting with women.
59331,Marge,"hi, pumpkins!"
63039,Marge,"oh my god, he'll kill himself! he'll never hear me say ""i told you so!"""
56686,Marge,now i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. like switching to the metric system...
58182,Marge,what the? what are you doing inside?
67606,Marge,"mr. hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
59223,Marge,"well, i'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see bart eating his vegetables."
56798,Marge,he's getting away!! c'mon! c'mon!
66011,Marge,excuse me.
65804,Marge,"maybe instead of watching tv with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
56908,Marge,and don't put signs on your sister.
61370,Marge,what are you going to do?
55137,Marge,"there you go, lisa. no pimentos. bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. homer, i'll sew your pants but i'm out of bologna."
58248,Marge,"oh, all right. you can stay up late tonight. but tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock."
66300,Marge,"homer, tell them your side of the story. i know i hurt you, but please trust me now. it'll work."
57773,Marge,"reverend, i hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. i'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
63302,Marge,"that's better. now, let's role... play!"
64148,Marge,it's all my fault: homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. but no. i had to have spring rolls! they taste like nothing!
54747,Marge,oh my. where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
65352,Marge,why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? what have we done that's so terrible?
63402,Marge,now to make the folded index card that goes in front of the cake.
64477,Marge,this isn't fair! i want romance!
64470,Marge,you like potato...
60411,Marge,"oh, that's very sweet, artie."
67394,Marge,"well, thank you very much, mr....?"
55751,Marge,lisa.
55705,Marge,who are you?
62398,Marge,"oh sure you can, sweetie. just don't make a habit of it."
62755,Marge,"ooh, your toaster takes bagels. how ritzy!"
59243,Marge,are you comparing yourself to our lord?
63677,Marge,it's the first of the month. the day you promised to start your new diet.
60060,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
65798,Marge,mmm! cursive!
55780,Marge,what was that noise?
56679,Marge,"""tested,"" homer, god tested moses. and try to be nice to my sisters. it's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
56362,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
57572,Marge,"i should've said ""limit -- one per customer."""
55945,Marge,that's a photo of homer and me at our wedding.
64659,Marge,"honey, his name is walt warren, and he's a very nice man. he stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car."
62626,Marge,"uh-oh. ""i know i'm just a lifeguard, but i want you to run away with me. if you don't reply to this letter, i'll know that you've chosen to stay with abe. but i know in my heart that the baby you're carrying is mine."
65666,Marge,you're all bald!
66444,Marge,"oh, perfect. now that's art."
65786,Marge,what if they are better for the kids than us?
62595,Marge,"bart, bob is a family man now. you can't be a bad person if you have a family."
63727,Marge,the load is on the road.
60423,Marge,of course.
61522,Marge,artie ziff!
62248,Marge,"oh, fine."
55907,Marge,"bart, run upstairs and get grampa's medicine!"
60969,Marge,"school's starting, bart. aren't you excited? this year you learn about local history!"
66098,Marge,where's it from?
59241,Marge,"you did it, homie!"
66817,Marge,"goodbye, elon. our town will never forgive you!"
63248,Marge,this basement is a wonderful gift to the family. but how could you afford it?
65273,Marge,"people learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. and now, patty and selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
60790,Marge,"wow, lenny. your apartment is stunning."
55399,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey."
58591,Marge,"nine months later, i gave birth to maggie."
60626,Marge,she's got a set of lungs on her.
62079,Marge,i'll take a cart.
55567,Marge,"oh, aren't you nice. gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
57954,Marge,"no, that was gophers."
61134,Marge,to hell with the livery commission!
61712,Marge,we were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
59447,Marge,when i get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
56088,Marge,"homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance."
54849,Marge,"homer, look! they give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow."
55036,Marge,"well, i haven't said no to you lately, have i?"
65434,Marge,i don't think so.
59984,Marge,this song has been going on for hours.
66593,Marge,it's everywhere.
58539,Marge,what are those cats doing behind you?
60575,Marge,"bart, your prank caused ten million dollars in damages."
59508,Marge,"ohhh, it's so cozy."
67757,Marge,"lisa, i brought you some lemonade for your protest."
65324,Marge,my pleasure.
59321,Marge,i'll never get rid of this useless junk.
60482,Marge,"homer, you got a letter. hm. it's from the library."
64758,Marge,"colonel ketchup, i say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener."
56038,Marge,"uh, i don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!"
66138,Marge,perfect! perfect!
63743,Marge,it won't go down!
66177,Marge,"i'm sorry, but does kirk know how silly he looks?"
61104,Marge,that treehouse is never gonna get built at this rate. time to call in the pros.
62029,Marge,billions!
56595,Marge,me too. let's go home.
60434,Marge,i make mine with m&ms.
61659,Marge,this is so luxurious! i feel like i'm princess grace and princess di smashed together!
60340,Marge,how was your day? do you really want to know?
67905,Marge,sure.
56315,Marge,"so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
67009,Marge,"now, doctor, that's not true."
62406,Marge,"lisa, do you really want to watch this?"
58443,Marge,big enough for two...
60730,Marge,my poor babies!
63913,Marge,"now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. it's cinnamon! nightie-night, sweetheart."
62366,Marge,an oogli-boogli!
65230,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
56257,Marge,funny... the way everything reminds me of homer.
56012,Marge,you're right. i am lucky to have him.
54935,Marge,yes.
62654,Marge,"oh. chief wiggum. uh, are you still with the police department?"
67116,Marge,umm-hmm.
60496,Marge,"""just then, sir lancelot rode up on a white horse and saved joan of arc. they got married and lived in a spaceship. the end."""
66447,Marge,olá!
62953,Marge,that's it! we're outta here.
55773,Marge,do you need a beer to fall asleep?
55208,Marge,"oh, homie. you're good at lots of things."
54667,Marge,what's his name again?
63445,Marge,"so, how was your first day at your new job?"
55497,Marge,i think you're making him angry.
67415,Marge,"well, i don't feel like snuggling."
66114,Marge,and love conquered all / with a train from the mall
67005,Marge,"oh, homer."
63452,Marge,"homie, what are you doing? you don't know how to fly!"
66184,Marge,"homie, i thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up."
59802,Marge,"oh, nothing... how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison?"
60598,Marge,"manjula, come quick! the octuplets said their first words."
58128,Marge,bart's absolutely right. this is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
58227,Marge,"homer, you know i always try to put the best face on everything. but there's no face on that damn bean! we hate it here and the family wants to leave."
66579,Marge,"here's what i would do... in the middle of the night, clean bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
55799,Marge,lisa needs braces.
62368,Marge,"well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees? but before you answer, consider this: the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant."
59114,Marge,"according to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""frasier."" and that's where ellen degeneres and anne heche live."
65903,Marge,from the gas station?
58788,Marge,"all right, i'll get you the materials. but you're building it."
58037,Marge,the police auction...
58779,Marge,to what?
58408,Marge,do it!
55139,Marge,"homer, i'm running late as it is. can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
59327,Marge,i'm sorry!
64927,Marge,what are you talking about?
55711,Marge,"homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
55507,Marge,it's our only hope.
60443,Marge,i said you'll be late for school.
58912,Marge,"beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
55663,Marge,"homie, what is it?"
66861,Marge,i didn't mean to use that word! it's okay to have a feminine side. it's good in fact!
58061,Marge,"homer, be careful..."
56138,Marge,"those aren't tickets to the game, homer."
60752,Marge,"oh, sweetie."
62546,Marge,here's a ten. make your own card.
58711,Marge,no!
57701,Marge,"make sure he brushes his teeth, lisa."
59346,Marge,"i'm home, everybody! gee, the house looks great!"
64618,Marge,we can't let lisa get her hopes up.
60746,Marge,what if i just do aerobics and ...
64884,Marge,he's starting to wake up.
64347,Marge,he what?!
60135,Marge,"just, just let me get--"
58105,Marge,"no, no. no tricks. it was salesmanship, that's all."
65847,Marge,help me out of the closet! wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
56055,Marge,this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
59635,Marge,"so, the next time you see a sheriff, shoot him..."
60966,Marge,"well, that's great, honey."
66027,Marge,that's it -- tomorrow we're doing something educational! we're going to the science museum!
67196,Marge,sure.
58382,Marge,and your shirt!
67072,Marge,shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
61623,Marge,"i won't let edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die."
55480,Marge,"oh. well, yes, that's what i meant, too. well, tell you what. this afternoon, i'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
63835,Marge,fine.
56738,Marge,uh-oh...
55344,Marge,"operator, i'd like to place an order for my husband."
65749,Marge,aw.
61284,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
58523,Marge,"that was no accident! shame on you, nelson."
62686,Marge,and how. but this is different.
59420,Marge,"bart? honey, i think you should go play with rod and todd."
66261,Marge,"this is a great thing! we're helping people celebrate christmas, and we'll be able to afford christmas!"
65677,Marge,there's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere. at least maybe a piñata...?
57713,Marge,"oh, bart, we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home."
63973,Marge,"gee, they sure give the christmas spirit the bum's rush around here."
63215,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie?"
56552,Marge,wait! daddy! wait! please don't leave. take me with you!
61199,Marge,"hmp, i finally caught up with grampa. i found him crying in the cemetery. thanks for taking care of maggie."
66676,Marge,he has a point...
64719,Marge,now remember what grampa said: you can spend the money any way you want.
56302,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
65694,Marge,you know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!
63449,Marge,"look at this business center -- fax, wi-fi, teleconferencing capabilities... i'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!"
57466,Marge,"only three cavities, bart. your best check-up ever. i'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
60738,Marge,sometimes i worry you might think about other women.
61873,Marge,"sometimes i think he's more interested in his ""itchy and mitchy"" cartoons than me."
58685,Marge,"yes. you've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
62807,Marge,perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
55450,Marge,it's church. you have to go.
63650,Marge,"i've gotten so much accomplished: i saved ""lost"", watched all of ""rome"" in a day, and got through ""two and a half men"" in two and a half minutes. then i ran out of space and had to choose between ""sophie's choice"" and ""schindler's list."""
57059,Marge,bart!
67207,Marge,of course.
65054,Marge,"i'm sorry, fat tony. my husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:"
60989,Marge,"well, it ain't happening today."
54809,Marge,oh... thank you.
63501,Marge,"ooo, edu-loving!"
62017,Marge,i know how to save this park -- i'm gonna organize a charity carnival!
57607,Marge,"oh, all right, all right, i'll get your milk!"
58718,Marge,why don't you kids play one of your old board games?
55298,Marge,"you've got a wonderful family, homer. please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
63396,Marge,i promised them a cake!
63178,Marge,yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here. they're the most delicious fish in the ocean.
54764,Marge,homer?
61702,Marge,"while you two are up on the roof, why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter!"
67436,Marge,"look, it's tony bennett!"
62947,Marge,"hmmm... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way."""
56565,Marge,yeah... you might even say he was an american hero.
60339,Marge,i am not gonna make you another sparerib smoothie. most people with their jaws wired shut don't gain weight.
61340,Marge,"they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz, which is still pretty good. oh. the second one wants custard, too. that's a little repetitive."
62333,Marge,noooo!!!
59170,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
57653,Marge,"well, i never thought it would come to this, but i guess we'll have to sell grandma's civil war doll."
55445,Marge,"yeah, go on."
57424,Marge,what about the sleaze and the depravity?!
64721,Marge,"ooo, so many celebrities have their own label: princess penelope, booberella, the real housewives of ogdenville, even scratchy."
58721,Marge,"oh, the hippo's missing..."
61713,Marge,i told my friends i had a date...
56275,Marge,i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered?
57777,Marge,"oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the listen lady!"
58077,Marge,there it is!
55514,Marge,"oh, all right."
63485,Marge,she's perfect! for the first time since you became an opera star i can finally relax.
59506,Marge,"this family has hit a new low. we're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... and it's all your fault."
65831,Marge,the kids?
67493,Marge,"bart, you can come down to dinner as soon as you're ready to apologize to your sister. and it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody, and you have to mean it."
60544,Marge,"yeah! i did it! marge is in the house! or, i will be soon. 'cause it needs some cleaning!"
64486,Marge,"hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
62452,Marge,"hi, sweetie."
66870,Marge,i hope no one was hurt.
62603,Marge,vendetta means... vendetta!
55313,Marge,"there, there..."
63700,Marge,a carnival? what's so romantic about this?
64105,Marge,we'll make it up to you. we'll do something you've always wanted to do but never got the chance.
55785,Marge,you don't have to start drinking right away. i was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
62004,Marge,homie...
60774,Marge,"wait, wait! my son, my husband and the van houten boy are in there!"
59471,Marge,gimme that!
56920,Marge,what's going on here?
55403,Marge,"homie, i didn't get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid."
55928,Marge,"bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
62381,Marge,i can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
63077,Marge,"homer, don't drink and drive!"
62605,Marge,"we're in a foreign city, with no car, being stalked by a killer. i feel like i'm the bourne identity!"
57362,Marge,have you lost your mind?!
67016,Marge,arrrgh!
61753,Marge,"okay, kids show off your pipes..."
60978,Marge,it's on my apron.
55527,Marge,"bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
65371,Marge,ooh! an apron with a sonnet!
61158,Marge,"ooo, the pretender!"
61697,Marge,"now, on a different subject, kiss me hard."
58929,Marge,just do it.
62584,Marge,all i wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
62112,Marge,you keep almost dying. just look at our vacation photos.
55787,Marge,you've saved more than a hundred dollars. i found it in your pants.
56486,Marge,"i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. i told her you were a decent man. but she wouldn't listen. besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more i can do."
60341,Marge,"well, let's see... i was in the kitchen, counting the corncobs on the curtains..."
65727,Marge,"homer simpson! when i fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks. but some day those good looks are gonna fade."
61844,Marge,"yes, it's something, dear."
56041,Marge,"homer, i have to go out to pick up something for dinner."
60661,Marge,dessert is three desserts.
61954,Marge,"homer, i want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!"
64823,Marge,"well, if he's got you cornered, and milhouse isn't there to help you, there's only one way out: make him feel good about himself."
62674,Marge,we couldn't find a way out.
66092,Marge,not a good time!
63974,Marge,"okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one christmas present with no hurt feelings. i'm returning this kitten calendar."
55322,Marge,"hmmm, i hope my poor little baby's okay."
61406,Marge,temperance barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham...
60106,Marge,"mmm... good morning, pierce. where's homer?"
59440,Marge,"that's it, bart. you're taking this man-of-the-house thing too far."
64181,Marge,it's like a sauna in here!
64805,Marge,that's odd. lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
55143,Marge,fruit leather... tree fresh imitation orange drink... krusty brand duck sausage pizza...
57026,Marge,"this year, i'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
63521,Marge,"where are you, homie?"
66516,Marge,i don't know... we have church the next morning... starts at eleven...
64498,Marge,i like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar.
55253,Marge,i don't think you've thought this through.
61425,Marge,it's double-spaced.
54684,Marge,"side-by-side on my piano keyboard / oh lord, why don't we..."
65873,Marge,a teacher can't be a bully.
59424,Marge,i think it is!
59518,Marge,restock the possum bar. we're almost out of claws.
60940,Marge,"homer, send these people home. this housewarming party's been going on for two days."
58023,Marge,what?!
60450,Marge,i'm not sure i approve of selling whiskey to children.
58863,Marge,no thanks. but thanks.
61341,Marge,"oh no, it's raining! and maggie's diapers are extra-absorbent!"
60803,Marge,"well, okay. blow out that lamp and i'll take off my victorian undergarments."
58173,Marge,i'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
57268,Marge,"well, things were bad everywhere."
66106,Marge,i'm gonna do what i've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.
67225,Marge,what are we laughing at?
66731,Marge,"oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. what if -- all the dads jammed together... in a dad band?!"
55980,Marge,don't wait up.
65827,Marge,can you find anything you like in this bed?
64757,Marge,these classic board games are fun and safe.
59182,Marge,it's impossible. i killed you.
65901,Marge,why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
62421,Marge,you're watching cartoons!
62364,Marge,"hold on, i'll be off in a minute."
59736,Marge,"oh, please. i didn't say that for clapping."
67470,Marge,"homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters."
67600,Marge,david.
58945,Marge,"oh, your father traded our tools for m&m's again. ah, the heck with it."
57502,Marge,"all right, i was trying to keep it from you, but i had a good reason. every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. remember last year?"
59930,Marge,"goodbye, homie. here's dr. hibbert's number if you feel weak."
59637,Marge,"good night, laughlin!"
58586,Marge,"there i was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, i was abducted by aliens."
54725,Marge,"children, it's time for you to go to bed."
62641,Marge,not to mention this power point demonstration he did just last week.
64678,Marge,humbler!
61832,Marge,"look, i'll be a winner with feet of clay... like mickey mantle. everyone loves the mick."
62207,Marge,knockers on route 98.
60656,Marge,"if you like protecting people, you could make that your job. you know, start a security company."
54838,Marge,"homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
58238,Marge,close enough.
59981,Marge,what? what is it?
62884,Marge,a mixer? i don't know -- i am still technically married...
58716,Marge,sure you do. you have the right to remain silent.
56214,Marge,"homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely."
59678,Marge,"well, you can't argue with results..."
65187,Marge,"""when you stick a pancake into a friend's mouth, it's a 'goorsha.'"" everybody goorsha!"
64358,Marge,homer?! does this mean you still love me?
63147,Marge,"gil, listen. we've been very patient, but i want you to..."
62847,Marge,two.
66185,Marge,ooh!
64397,Marge,strawberries and whipped cream.
57204,Marge,on the street in your mind.
63595,Marge,homer! the wedding's in twenty minutes! just pick a tie!
58570,Marge,"sorry, but if i let you watch one of these gruesome halloween cartoons, i'd be a pretty lousy mother."
67280,Marge,"hello, homie. i was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work."
59460,Marge,oh!
57255,Marge,"hello? oh, hello, principal skinner... no, bart has never been to hong kong... goodnight."
59326,Marge,stop it!
63122,Marge,"when you're done putting lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day."
63693,Marge,"whatever, homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life..."
55727,Marge,selma! your date's over already?
67734,Marge,my prom date.
56255,Marge,"kids, your father and i are going through a really tough time right now. and i don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
60516,Marge,why did you do it?
54699,Marge,maybe not this time...
55974,Marge,"i'm disappointed in you, but it turns out i had a wonderful time with ruth powers. in fact, we're going out again tomorrow night."
65075,Marge,"sorry, the occurrence, but to use your lingo, homer and i have to be ""that guy."""
67870,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
60459,Marge,honey...
55221,Marge,"lisa, i know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. see, this morning i turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for bart and homer."
54601,Marge,"if you think that, you should meet my new professor. professor august has shown me a side of the world i never knew."
55276,Marge,"well, it's nice. but who is this woman?"
56904,Marge,"oh, lisa, honey, i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
55334,Marge,"otto, you can't just sit there watching tv all day."
63096,Marge,my own art show?! i'm so happy... do you mind?
62440,Marge,"all right, we get it!"
58501,Marge,"hm. i brought you a tuna sandwich. they say it's brain food. i guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are."
56193,Marge,the point is the real simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
57051,Marge,go on maggie.
60186,Marge,"""dear burly, comma, i've never written to a registered trademark before. are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? in either case, i would love a signed photo. sincerely, marge simpson."""
57052,Marge,well homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
62911,Marge,what?!
61694,Marge,"oh, me too..."
66467,Marge,"right, right, right, right. according to judy kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
59179,Marge,someone saw us.
57357,Marge,"night vision goggles? a bathroom scale from a soviet sub? a suede briefcase-case? oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems..."
59167,Marge,"homie, my women's intuition's acting up. something bad's going to happen if you go in there."
66056,Marge,"""dear 'horny in haverbrook,' sorry, i am not interested in cheating on my wonderful husband, who is described in the attached pdf. say hello to my trash folder, marge simpson."""
58816,Marge,i can't believe it. he covered your whole bed with wildflowers?
60184,Marge,burly. you're so rugged and manly...
59854,Marge,"yes, it says here he's the movie magician behind ""creepshow,"" ""friday the 13th"" and ""dawn of the dead."""
64308,Marge,"guys, please. when you yell like that, no one can hear me."
64918,Marge,"and anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? they went to the beach every day!"
60046,Marge,mm. that sounds perfect!
55173,Marge,"well, i could use a little more. and sometimes i want a little time to myself, and i expect you to help --"
63186,Marge,my husband meant no harm. there must be some way he can pay for what he did. he's good at opening jars.
65723,Marge,"lisa and maggie are downstairs, and bart's in his room with milhouse."
58543,Marge,mmm. what do you think he's doing up there?
54721,Marge,chip!
67420,Marge,"can i have your plate, mr. burns?"
57275,Marge,"but apu, the vote on proposition 24 is tuesday. you'll have to pass the test before then."
59946,Marge,i won. don't take that away from me.
65042,Marge,"while your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods, i thought we could do a little bonding of our own."
61257,Marge,"that's the last of them. you did the right thing, bart, and now you can keep the money."
56761,Marge,"homer! for the love of god, no."
60910,Marge,"bye, kids! bye, bye!"
56363,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
60308,Marge,"if you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."
65571,Marge,darn car won't start.
56263,Marge,"homer, that's not a good thing."
62773,Marge,"homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through..."
56905,Marge,"oh, it was no trouble. the hobos at the dump were very helpful. except one man who seemed to have mental problems."
64161,Marge,can you at least bring a sweater for maggie?
54692,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
61818,Marge,stop! you're tainting my entry!
65306,Marge,"actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family."
65329,Marge,don't panic. this can be separated out. quick! does anyone have a centrifuge?!
54872,Marge,"i know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but i'm not sure about the people bart's working for. i thinks they're criminals."
57738,Marge,"bart, where did you get all this stuff?"
56850,Marge,"homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
67383,Marge,"that does it. children, get dressed. we're leaving."
64392,Marge,hi ned. where are the boys?
58239,Marge,"sorry kids, there's no such thing as hoverbikes. they're just a couple of huffys on a fishing line!"
66207,Marge,what?!
56596,Marge,"i love you too, homie."
58595,Marge,suckers.
62290,Marge,"homer, i'm glad you're getting exercise, i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
59470,Marge,bart!
57224,Marge,"i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. homer, you go, too."
66111,Marge,drama! drama!
61308,Marge,"come on, homie. we'll go to the ""make your own sundae"" place."
56940,Marge,we missed you so much!
66719,Marge,ooh. are you mr. clean?
61624,Marge,"let's just say in an emergency, i wouldn't count on either one."
62312,Marge,you know what i mean.
64890,Marge,i didn't. i got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. so not a peep out of anyone till the fiesta bowl!
57313,Marge,"okay, bart, your turn, your turn."
60848,Marge,you were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
65237,Marge,i don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so homie can go back to his old job?
55598,Marge,"well, who was it?"
61162,Marge,i want to thank you all so much.
61258,Marge,well... someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation.
63410,Marge,yes there is!
67257,Marge,"goodbye, my special, my special little guy. you will write us, won't you?"
61483,Marge,what's all that racket?!
67163,Marge,"oh, dear, i didn't realize there was so much to this game. what do you charge for lessons?"
54807,Marge,"please, homie? for me?"
63870,Marge,shouldn't you just be happy for their success?
61452,Marge,"come spring, they sought help from the native americans."
61140,Marge,"i am so sorry, homie. how is your crushed pelvis?"
59945,Marge,i did it! i caught the school bus. now hurry up and get on.
58261,Marge,"they need a good, stiff, all-purpose dress shoe. something for church, but also for doctors appointments dental check-ups, piano recitals, building dedications, visiting elderly relatives, haircuts and shoe shopping."
61789,Marge,"oh, homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor."
61933,Marge,"homer, look!"
60260,Marge,and a happy and healthy new year.
65756,Marge,i don't know if we're gonna be able to get out. what are you writing?
54766,Marge,"we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble, but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
56180,Marge,i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now. isn't there something you'd like to say?
66411,Marge,"well, they all have their charms..."
56156,Marge,oh bart. cleaning doesn't have to be a chore. here... work to the music.
62211,Marge,...then take bart to get c-i-r-c-u-m-c-i-s-e-d.
66665,Marge,i'll go make up the couch for you.
67091,Marge,"let's go, homer."
60633,Marge,homer!
59042,Marge,"mmm-mm. oh, i can feel the pounds just melting off."
59091,Marge,"boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
66571,Marge,i don't know. uh... how about... that's a lot worse!
60211,Marge,chief wiggum!
59752,Marge,it's ten in the morning!
55006,Marge,"don't worry. whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
55016,Marge,pink.
59792,Marge,"hey! hey, over here! here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!"
60794,Marge,your school chums are going to be so jealous of your little outfit.
64947,Marge,"homie, you always mean to say the nicest things."
66364,Marge,jasper beardley! you'll never make it!
62724,Marge,i believe he's saying he's okay.
67155,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
60967,Marge,i can't count how many times your father's done something crazy like this.
66600,Marge,"i'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches."
59950,Marge,"no, i got it!"
55196,Marge,"no, homer. the truth would humiliate her."
62531,Marge,"here, try yours on. i got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. somebody here likes princess cakes."
60919,Marge,"oh, my gosh, you're right: steroids have turned me into everything i hate. let's go home, sweetie."
63324,Marge,not at all!
64786,Marge,just sugarplums and buttercups.
57642,Marge,i do.
54904,Marge,who wants to say grace?
63128,Marge,"you can't go home tonight! it's cold, it's late..."
60463,Marge,"oh, my god!"
67940,Marge,"why milhouse, don't you look pretty."
55378,Marge,you're what?
62086,Marge,he brought home your homework when you were sick.
59808,Marge,let's let a little sunshine in.
65551,Marge,"even you, caveman homer."
64439,Marge,then don't have any.
56237,Marge,"homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. you've ruined a perfectly good jacket."
62372,Marge,huh.
57893,Marge,i came up with the idea.
61494,Marge,'got your nose' and other lies...
58025,Marge,hello. so... what brings you to america?
60515,Marge,you made that call? but you're the good one.
64311,Marge,really?
65781,Marge,oh god! they want to steal our kids!
62114,Marge,"i know, i just wan--"
64365,Marge,"mmmm, i love this wine."
59227,Marge,shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
55254,Marge,you wouldn't want what he's eating. it's mostly just snouts and entrails.
66465,Marge,you can do better!
58821,Marge,"it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?"
58686,Marge,look out! behind you!
67715,Marge,bringing up a son -- even a blind one -- isn't a lifetime occupation. now the more you help him--
66970,Marge,sure! you never forget. it's just like riding a bicycle.
55560,Marge,yeah...
61190,Marge,"bart, plants don't-- wheww!"
58124,Marge,homer! i think i heard a noise.
61731,Marge,"oh, elvis."
63265,Marge,nooooo! it's gone! that family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
64535,Marge,"dear lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that i am right as usual."
66667,Marge,those are in the kitchen!
56506,Marge,shh. i don't want people to see us looking at these books.
60170,Marge,"well, don't look too hip. you don't want that girl falling for you."
60401,Marge,what?
66146,Marge,"i too am a freak. one eye is blue, and the other a pale brown."
57359,Marge,a competent doctor!
54998,Marge,it's the miracle we've been waiting for.
55930,Marge,i'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. and then we'll make him double it.
60115,Marge,she'll be killed!
57763,Marge,"homer, the lord only asks for an hour a week."
62758,Marge,where's ben?
56796,Marge,"it's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
54644,Marge,"consent, of course."
62608,Marge,where's reverend lovejoy? he's never been late for christmas service.
60033,Marge,breakfast!
56252,Marge,"you, too."
56010,Marge,"i'm sorry, i should have asked first."
64554,Marge,nope.
63054,Marge,"now listen, bub. you go down to those recruiters and tell them bart is too young for the army. i don't want this to be the only memory i have of him."
66605,Marge,bubble gum cigarettes?
65514,Marge,"bart, just tell us the problem!"
62670,Marge,he'll sleep tonight.
54861,Marge,"bart, how many hours a day do you watch tv?"
58432,Marge,"when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our saturdays? driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"
57869,Marge,"i'm so glad we took the subway. ""laser wart removal"". wow, the future is here!"
65828,Marge,"homer, bart said the kids were going to the van houtens, but luann just told me they're supposed to be here. they've disappeared!"
62523,Marge,and i threw out all your old comics!
63295,Marge,earthland realms?
63972,Marge,it might be a fun way to kill a couple hours.
55240,Marge,oh dear!
67073,Marge,my feet are getting wet!
57395,Marge,no excuses! just do it!
55570,Marge,"oh, and how about piping in some tom jones music? that always cheers me up."
62197,Marge,"kids... i want you to know i've started seeing someone. he's from springfield, i think you know him..."
65680,Marge,"play along! ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. glug, glug, glug. that's a good little mammal."
64431,Marge,"grampa, no stories! you can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench."
59944,Marge,"i'm not racing! it's me, marge simpson!"
63543,Marge,ooh! shlomo's judaica is having a blowout on dreidels.
65544,Marge,"come here, you. /"
58950,Marge,"uh, i guess."
55554,Marge,chauffeur... seamstress...
63170,Marge,"ooh, this is one of our trips to barnacle bay! we used to rent a beach house there every summer."
65716,Marge,what move? we haven't moved! what's going on?!
65638,Marge,"homer, pay attention!"
67578,Marge,hello?
65506,Marge,"here's your lunches. with some cake. you'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
54970,Marge,"well, we're going to the beauty parlor. maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone."
54590,Marge,why don't you just stop playing?
63486,Marge,"chief, i think we should cancel the performance."
55929,Marge,"hmm, better sew that eye back on."
64193,Marge,"well, i know a place in this house where you can really relax."
62216,Marge,homer!
54803,Marge,"homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
58093,Marge,"ooo, i remember. mrs. astor was very lucky."
55761,Marge,"well, honey, i--"
65303,Marge,homie...
62527,Marge,"oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. have fun!"
60353,Marge,"i don't know what you said, but i'm sure it was beautiful. oh homer, this is the kind of night i thought we could never have together: incident free."
64253,Marge,"wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""i dare not"" wait upon ""i would?"""
63154,Marge,marge simpson is gonna say no!
58056,Marge,ooo... oo! there's an azalea festival at the public garden!
56062,Marge,"legalized gambling is a bad idea. you can build a casino over my dead body! blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
64518,Marge,"""pork butt in cream,"" ""snout-fried neck,"" ""frog haunch,"" ""hooves au jus,"" ""possum pouch pie..."""
58602,Marge,secure.
60822,Marge,kent brockman?!
66025,Marge,no karate monsters in the bathtub!
64560,Marge,homer?
62415,Marge,we need professional help.
56675,Marge,"homer, is this projection accurate? did you borrow money from my sisters?"
56423,Marge,"hello, police? this is marge simpson. my husband is on a murderous rampage. over."
67481,Marge,"homer, shouldn't you go pick up grampa?"
62894,Marge,you really mean that?
56919,Marge,it's like i'm on some wonderful drug!
57455,Marge,you know who the real victim is in all this? milhouse.
59210,Marge,"well, it's probably just a bad growing season."
55551,Marge,"where does the bible say ""racket?""...."
59829,Marge,"that's right, a job."
58289,Marge,"homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!"
67042,Marge,"homer, wake up! wake up! oh my, here let me wipe off that drool."
60327,Marge,"please, homie. dump the sugar. for me."
65374,Marge,"now, last but not least, your present, homie."
64312,Marge,what? that's crazy.
63607,Marge,why don't we do something special for you -- get you all snazzed up.
58719,Marge,when was the last time you played citizenship?
58465,Marge,"hang on, homie. i'm gonna try to set her down."
62550,Marge,you what?!
61116,Marge,all we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
60629,Marge,no!
62484,Marge,my spine is not a scratching post!
64899,Marge,"when it's closed it's a chair! when you were little, i used to take you to a mommy-and-me toddler gym."
64870,Marge,at least someone around here's got the christmas spirit.
56478,Marge,no. i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
67564,Marge,her group
55610,Marge,good.
60318,Marge,what are you talking about? is that dinner?
64462,Marge,i thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. at least that's what the letter said.
62318,Marge,think of the leg up you'd have!
57863,Marge,"homer! homer, those legs belong to the man behind you."
62314,Marge,that's coming from next door!
66241,Marge,you don't hear me listening to the thompson twins anymore. although...
61872,Marge,"nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? i have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
64113,Marge,like it was yesterday...
67823,Marge,"well, homer. there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
57470,Marge,we never will.
56804,Marge,"well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
60847,Marge,"okay lisa, now open the present from your father and me."
60317,Marge,"oh, hello homer."
57166,Marge,"homer, please. i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
59729,Marge,"well, maybe a sip. i don't want to offend our mentalist."
60383,Marge,...but then he turned into an octopus!
58482,Marge,"ohh, so you don't have a date. you can still go and have a wonderful time."
57148,Marge,"i used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. i can show you."
55447,Marge,really?
59113,Marge,eewww!!
63605,Marge,stop naming things!
59003,Marge,"well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love. you truly are an artist."
66715,Marge,we brought cheerios for you!
61848,Marge,it's the best i could do on such short notice.
61324,Marge,that last one looked kinda good.
64463,Marge,"i'm not a dude, i'm a hottie!"
64476,Marge,it's so noisy in here! i can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
54707,Marge,how much money did he piss away on this?
65718,Marge,i thought the basement looked cleaner.
63233,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no! let's not get crazy."
57249,Marge,"oh, honey, you've had your glory. now it's bart's turn."
61786,Marge,"this is the kitchen i've always wanted. ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
63738,Marge,"no, i'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs."
60836,Marge,but i'm afraid you'll get hurt.
61484,Marge,that's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. all they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
64668,Marge,is your room clean?
56924,Marge,parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
66659,Marge,dum got a job at the tower of london... as a beefeater!
58630,Marge,"oh my goodness! homer, get her out of there!"
63129,Marge,what is all this?
54985,Marge,homer! i've always said you were a good father. i've always defended you when people put you down.
59531,Marge,"ooh, ""tango de la muerte."" i've been dying to see that movie!"
67400,Marge,"lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?"
55971,Marge,your point being?
62864,Marge,it's so great to have my children back.
58585,Marge,it all happened about two years ago...
67487,Marge,"now, just wait a minute! i'm sure there's room for both."
58109,Marge,hello? anyone home?
56597,Marge,did you have to be so graphic?
63946,Marge,"okay, but first the chest."
66792,Marge,so what do we do?
55273,Marge,"homie, aren't you coming inside?"
62330,Marge,where's homer and bart?
63047,Marge,"homer! you won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?"
65249,Marge,"for god's sakes, homer! i've given you three children!"
60083,Marge,"gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens."
58536,Marge,not you. bart.
60128,Marge,she's such a butthole.
64832,Marge,stop burning!
59913,Marge,"oh, okay."
60162,Marge,ooh... it must be chinese new year.
57549,Marge,...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
57019,Marge,which was?
67352,Marge,"you know, some women find bald men quite virile."
64592,Marge,"not air bites, real bites."
57957,Marge,as for the rest of you...
64119,Marge,it's not a big deal. we'll just go to city hall and get married there.
67799,Marge,"bye, herb."
57174,Marge,no-no-no-no-nooo!
66702,Marge,i didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.
57139,Marge,"honey, i don't think these clothes are us..."
67049,Marge,"do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, bart?"
61909,Marge,did you just swallow another bone?
61678,Marge,and nobody does it better.
56643,Marge,that's better.
63660,Marge,"bart, i know this is nuts, but try to look sad."
54712,Marge,hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
60728,Marge,"hello, principal skinner."
61795,Marge,i'm not wearing any clothes. so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table!
66143,Marge,mr. burnsum! you should treat these poor people with respect!
56181,Marge,are you thinking what i'm thinking?
56654,Marge,"i can't believe our government would set up bart like that. i must say, i'm very angry at the state department right now."
67557,Marge,no.
61361,Marge,forget it.
62988,Marge,"cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
54750,Marge,"well, i was wondering. do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? i wouldn't ask, except i'm desperate."
63185,Marge,"well, at least they left your underwear on. that was nice of them."
61612,Marge,spice up! spice up!
62669,Marge,what are those doing there?
67152,Marge,sure.
59308,Marge,why are we stopping here?
54795,Marge,xl.
63736,Marge,my bosoms came in and ruined my balance.
67087,Marge,"oh, homer... my brilliant beast."
57098,Marge,are you hiding something? what do you have under your jacket?
63667,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way. we were planning a surprise party for you."
61853,Marge,"here's lisa! she'll save the party! honey, sit down... have a big slice of cake!"
56096,Marge,what is it?
62349,Marge,fros-ty! where's your magic top hat?
54713,Marge,"hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. maybe i should sit down with them and-- homer, where are you going?!"
55545,Marge,i think one side of our house is sinking.
54656,Marge,this is serious. pay attention!
67238,Marge,do it!
56391,Marge,this is just what i was hoping for. spending the day together as a family.
63041,Marge,i forgive you my darling. get well.
62732,Marge,"that's very sweet, but i..."
62178,Marge,he's turned it into a prison!
65803,Marge,look at me!
57593,Marge,the answer is no.
62433,Marge,"oh, sugar-booger!"
64953,Marge,a completely new hairstyle!
65936,Marge,...debugged and fresh as a daisy.
67657,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
58010,Marge,you shouldn't pressure bart like that.
58357,Marge,kiss it and make it boogie!
57926,Marge,"well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
58196,Marge,"aw, aren't you sweet? hey, my pearls!"
60781,Marge,"wow, it's so fancy. it's like moby's house on ""cribs""!"
66486,Marge,"homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself."
67391,Marge,sure.
57959,Marge,his name is homer.
65714,Marge,you've been through a traumatic experience. are you sure you wanna go to work today?
60457,Marge,"well, i don't know. i just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
58894,Marge,"oh, that's not the point. we should report this to an omnitouch care-rep. people's privacy is at stake."
58293,Marge,better. come look.
59383,Marge,party? no! no parties.
60840,Marge,orlando? are we going to sea world?
62704,Marge,chocks?! why don't we try it... freestyle.
59596,Marge,"don't mess with me, i've got jimmies!"
56011,Marge,homer?!
64650,Marge,"now that it's empty, who's gonna buy their house? what if someone moves in with two barts? or four teenage barts?"
58880,Marge,but there's only one way to find out!
64881,Marge,martha stewart! how did you get in here?!
66211,Marge,on a friday afternoon?! i bet he's playing poker again!
55963,Marge,you promised. you can't back out like when you volunteered for that army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
61473,Marge,we finally have something to put in the wall safe.
56373,Marge,"well, there was our trip to the amish country..."
55611,Marge,"oh, homie, didn't that hurt?"
60880,Marge,"oh my goodness, it looks just like the kwik-e-mart!"
54693,Marge,duffman!
67028,Marge,"what on earth are you talking about, homer?"
66780,Marge,we're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
55120,Marge,look at these prices. we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
57871,Marge,only in new york!
61385,Marge,"and lord, if you think i'm making lemon bars for your bake sale sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
65082,Marge,"well... newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
66294,Marge,how is that not stealing?
63275,Marge,bart gets another try!
56095,Marge,just a minute! don't hang up!
64425,Marge,remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?
63823,Marge,say something comforting.
60985,Marge,i just gotta stay one lesson ahead of the kid.
67127,Marge,uh... i-i'm saving it... for a special occasion.
59975,Marge,on the ground?
63335,Marge,my baby!
58655,Marge,no! we're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school.
60826,Marge,paris?
62544,Marge,bart... lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
66418,Marge,"oh, it looks great!"
64201,Marge,"schools have bathrooms! and i'm a woman, so my going in unattended won't cause a panic."
66079,Marge,"well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so i guess that's true."
67142,Marge,thirteen. double a.
56901,Marge,"bart, why are you talking like that?"
56334,Marge,he seemed to know a lot about brunch. but it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
55506,Marge,"homer, did you barricade the door?"
56439,Marge,have you noticed any change in bart?
61790,Marge,maybe you should turn off the power.
61128,Marge,i guess i'll have to do all your driving chores. that's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
55180,Marge,"how was detention today, dear?"
63447,Marge,"it's bad news, isn't it? i should never get my hopes up. nothing ever works out for us."
67790,Marge,thank you.
55827,Marge,an invitation to our high school reunion.
62252,Marge,cottage cheese!
55889,Marge,have you seen bart?
61993,Marge,"homie, i'm tired. i have to get up early to catch my flight."
56561,Marge,"daddy?! daddy, where are you, da..."
59270,Marge,"it's not a real car, grampa."
66244,Marge,"have a great day, kids. and bart, i'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons."
61088,Marge,i really don't want to do a lot of flip-de-loops.
64337,Marge,we don't have a panic room!
61196,Marge,"no, you'll be fine. i'll be right back."
60915,Marge,and that's why i didn't win!
58625,Marge,"ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?"
59276,Marge,will you turn that engine off?
61280,Marge,all this attention! i feel like a secretary on administrative professionals day!
62904,Marge,uh-huh. and him.
65780,Marge,"well, at least we have time to get the pets' christmas presents."
67539,Marge,dear purveyors of senseless violence: i know this may sound silly at first...
60130,Marge,no!
59472,Marge,you danced for hours just because they told you to?
65023,Marge,"ooh, the ""fan cam!"""
61633,Marge,a band in a closet! every girl's dream.
57971,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. no weapons."
65034,Marge,the school called and said bart is out of control. i think we may need some therapy for him.
60970,Marge,"ooh, a new hamburger sandwich."
61807,Marge,"it's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
65991,Marge,there might be some nagging involved.
63730,Marge,"zack, you're not trying to help our marriage, you're trying to split us up! i'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy!"
63934,Marge,they have a pe-dal car.
56073,Marge,what happened here?
57924,Marge,"uhh... you keep 'em. now listen. if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa. umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday..."
63023,Marge,it's so unfair -- i'm as handy as any man.
56691,Marge,"""dear mr. sherman. on behalf of the people of springfield, i would like to invite you to judge our film festival."""
64018,Marge,let's go get my little girl.
60523,Marge,but homer...
58569,Marge,"may i remind you that two people are dead? oh, wait. i just got it."
57155,Marge,"i've told you, i don't like you using the word hotbed. please, lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. and everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. bart, no grifting."
62199,Marge,you mean get beaten up by him?
54994,Marge,"i moe, i moe."
63618,Marge,"who thought walking could be so difficult? well, i'm sure everyone else is having trouble too."
63764,Marge,"i've talked to over five hundred men named lumpkin... everyone at lumpkin, lumpkin and rosenthal associates, an asian or pacific islander named cho lum kin..."
62813,Marge,who else has a story?
59015,Marge,but we lost the olympics to shelbyville.
65002,Marge,got a better idea?
60498,Marge,i love these jesters. they're exactly what i need to forget about my first husband.
58900,Marge,bad cat! leave her alone!
54675,Marge,doctor marvin monroe?! are you alive or dead?
63747,Marge,chazz busby says you're really making progress! do you need more leg warmers?
59671,Marge,like the one in berlin?
61772,Marge,marge!
62185,Marge,i want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
59120,Marge,"a drug? i know bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
56339,Marge,"okay, homer."
62935,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
55290,Marge,mrs. homer simpson.
61439,Marge,"please homie, don't hurt him!"
55833,Marge,time to go to the reunion.
58058,Marge,i don't want a drug boat.
56469,Marge,no.
64231,Marge,fine! you can have your key back!
60242,Marge,you think we can bribe her back with christmas?
65585,Marge,what do you mean?
63817,Marge,clothing?
60467,Marge,"grampa, come on."
60492,Marge,god wants you to lead the french army to what?
65660,Marge,"and these fake movie reviews are so mean, it's hilarious."
54705,Marge,"don't ask me, i'm just hair. your head stopped eighteen inches ago."
64889,Marge,everyone shush!
58247,Marge,"ooh, it's so late. you kids have to go to bed."
60732,Marge,"oh my special little guys. you're okay, you're okay!"
58677,Marge,"ohh, anything, sweetheart."
65326,Marge,i just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other.
60025,Marge,i stole it from mcbain after i cut off your father's thumb.
62009,Marge,really? is it one that will change the sleeping arrangements?
55736,Marge,your lips are turning blue. i think you'd better stay home.
60663,Marge,"homie, please. why don't you just leave town?"
63741,Marge,boring!
60079,Marge,no.
66370,Marge,don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
64173,Marge,"what's your angle, mister?"
59366,Marge,"i can't help it if i donated the most blood. oh, i'm feeling kinda woozy."
56700,Marge,yes.
62816,Marge,"ooh, like the paper towels. go on..."
64697,Marge,golf it is.
59679,Marge,"mmmm, these stigmuffins are to die for!"
64373,Marge,"homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages."
63884,Marge,bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. maybe there's too much sugar in his sugar-frosted candy o's.
62294,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie!"
67793,Marge,"hmm, well, i met homer in high school. we got married and had three beautiful children."
64221,Marge,i love tapas! it's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
58976,Marge,how's your father's project coming along?
58393,Marge,"whoops! there goes carlsbad caverns. oh, well."
67531,Marge,i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school?
66846,Marge,"see ya at the bake sale, sucker!"
67002,Marge,"are you coming in, homer?"
59785,Marge,"c'mon. you and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something i like."
67701,Marge,just those who need help with french.
54785,Marge,i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
62455,Marge,i learned about it in here.
67546,Marge,snuh!
61008,Marge,no!
64723,Marge,yes!
58810,Marge,i'd love to look at sculleryweek -- if you're through with it.
62288,Marge,"three million, one hundred and--"
56812,Marge,"hey everybody, mom's home."
63804,Marge,i didn't.
64729,Marge,is that the cat in there?!
65612,Marge,homie! do you know what yesterday was?
55121,Marge,"homer, i can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
56119,Marge,that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie.
55206,Marge,that's all right dear. i can do it.
60918,Marge,maybe death will stop your yammering!
59699,Marge,we don't have a stash.
59728,Marge,"oh. they ought to call that a ""large island iced tea."" no, ""long"" is better."
67473,Marge,the can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
56690,Marge,i'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. did you know there are over six hundred critics on tv and leonard maltin is the best looking of them all?
59746,Marge,what are you doing? why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
57024,Marge,"i'm so sorry i misjudged you, mom. you had to leave to protect your family."
55700,Marge,"homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
63966,Marge,what would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time i had my doubts about you?
60817,Marge,three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best!
57886,Marge,"no i don't! what i mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
65783,Marge,that's why they took our kids so quick.
65183,Marge,"okay marge, you test drove a convertible once, you can do this."
62374,Marge,"okay, water monsters. be friendly. but not too friendly."
63733,Marge,"lisa, have i ever shown you my shattered dreams box?"
63753,Marge,who was that?
57264,Marge,"oh, we've tried everything. olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj..."
61228,Marge,"i'm not fooling around, people! park your keisters in front of that tv! now!"
64069,Marge,our house is up to code.
58932,Marge,anyone? anyone at all?
56629,Marge,one more hour.
63597,Marge,you don't know what color my eyes are?
61760,Marge,"i wish we could go back, but i don't think we're welcome there."
67538,Marge,i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i'm going to write a letter.
67919,Marge,crazy horse!
59007,Marge,"ooh, i don't know. could be. i need some inspiration."
59145,Marge,"i understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on a treadmill?"
63133,Marge,i will.
57071,Marge,"oh, good. so get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the try-n-save."
64551,Marge,it's working!
55456,Marge,homer! are you actually giving up your faith?
67375,Marge,hmmm. this kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch.
60737,Marge,"ah, homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?"
64846,Marge,opossum!
57076,Marge,uh-oh. almost forgot to lock the doors.
60672,Marge,"but this is your chance to contact your late wife, maude."
60820,Marge,anything good?
63955,Marge,what are you doing?
59433,Marge,"homer, are you all right?"
64806,Marge,she doesn't want to end up like me?!
59890,Marge,did you make that awful effigy?
63633,Marge,you remembered i like romance!
64839,Marge,"i hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes."
65501,Marge,"so, how do the boys like springfield elementary?"
56449,Marge,"uh, i think you all owe my son an apology."
66142,Marge,just one m & m.
65215,Marge,a wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
61169,Marge,they had to admit homosexuals.
65100,Marge,i hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
58337,Marge,"no! no, bart! that money's going toward your college education."
56795,Marge,"homer, he cheated you."
62150,Marge,and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries. it was twenty years ago!
67259,Marge,the life jacket is under the seat.
65910,Marge,how many times do i have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the special olympics?
64001,Marge,"now remember, juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior."
59616,Marge,"oh, i've got too much to do to take a nap right now. lisa, get maggie out of that cage. and homer, since you're dressed for it, i got some s & m for ya: scrubbing and mopping."
65244,Marge,"homer, i want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation."
66624,Marge,we don't have drone delivery! you'll have to find a substitute!
64916,Marge,just a little merloooot.
63078,Marge,"lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! we're going vermonting!"
61052,Marge,mock...
59644,Marge,what?!
65509,Marge,where on the internet?
66104,Marge,i said no!
58281,Marge,"kids, from now on, i don't want you touching anything in our house. dart!"
54882,Marge,"dear lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, i'll try to be a better christian. i don't know what i can do... ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive i'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
61536,Marge,daddy's not on fire.
65547,Marge,it was not love at first sight!
65241,Marge,i know! and i don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. and i don't really want him to do that.
64588,Marge,you said it's your lunch. eat it.
59134,Marge,"""thank you in advance for a world-class meal. you're an inspiration to our entire organization. thank you again, bart."" ohh, what a lovely gesture!"
61438,Marge,"""as temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean, she realized it was... the end."""
55068,Marge,aww...
62698,Marge,here's my mask!
62006,Marge,"moe, i need to tell you something."
57917,Marge,"that's wonderful! but still, can't you do anything for bart?"
56118,Marge,that sounds like a good movie.
66787,Marge,i thought you were going to try to relax.
66790,Marge,what did you give him?
63570,Marge,another thing... i don't know where you go at night.
64854,Marge,no he doesn't!
55141,Marge,kids! hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
66620,Marge,i'm too nervous to sleep.
66517,Marge,why don't we have any couples friends?
54883,Marge,"homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? and what's all this?"
62274,Marge,"bart, you wanna go to the video arcade?"
60726,Marge,stop! you'll crush your juice boxes!
61441,Marge,that's the best review i've gotten. seriously. these reviews are terrible.
55076,Marge,"homer, for god's sakes, let him deliver the baby!"
62599,Marge,"bob, your generosity and abondanza have touched our hearts."
57631,Marge,ooooh.
58953,Marge,"oh, thanks."
61544,Marge,"enjoy your tour, and take it easy on mr. curtis. your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery."
60265,Marge,how can an iron be a landlord?
66383,Marge,"i brought homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
63481,Marge,"i couldn't agree more, julia."
55473,Marge,"lisa, i know a song that will cheer you up. there once was an ugly duckling..."
60454,Marge,i think we should try to restore bart's faith in buck. and we could start by getting buck to quit drinking.
59629,Marge,"now homer, this is no time to be thinking about food."
58176,Marge,"oh, ned! i'm so sorry!"
55986,Marge,mayor quimby! what are you doing here?
62275,Marge,"actually, i think your father's still upset about the way things went down."
55373,Marge,"homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
66454,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, wait! i wanna say something!"
58954,Marge,"oh, how cute. let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."""
62353,Marge,is this a snuggle film?!
60625,Marge,"i am so sick of doing her dirty work. she's taking advantage of us, homer."
55157,Marge,homer! if maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.
63341,Marge,okay. if you pretend to be our chauffeur at my high school reunion.
60165,Marge,every house has a bathroom.
54881,Marge,"homie, please be all right."
67043,Marge,"well, i'm still trying to figure out what's bothering lisa. i don't know, bart's such a handful, and maggie needs attention, but all the while our little lisa's becoming a young woman."
61337,Marge,i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity. not like janey's mom.
63759,Marge,are you calling me fat?
60247,Marge,here she comes! and-a one and-a two and-a...
63456,Marge,"homer, you did it! you landed a jet!"
63742,Marge,"look, lis! i'm as supple as ever!"
60003,Marge,"they also make ""juice-lix."""
61021,Marge,"krusty, why did you just drop your pants?"
63072,Marge,i wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
56265,Marge,"i must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
56661,Marge,"i'm sorry. homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
59528,Marge,"but you need to try things on! every brand has a different idea of ""husky."""
58439,Marge,ohhh. my hero.
55147,Marge,okay.
65194,Marge,"homie, i don't want you to feel excluded. would you like to come with us to dinner at el chemistri?"
64164,Marge,"come on, maggie. have some grapefruit."
60713,Marge,"so to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. do you like it?"
61530,Marge,i'm not.
57143,Marge,"it fits like a dream, too. but we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. it wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. if it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
57635,Marge,nope.
64215,Marge,"wow, your first day at the new school! lisa, have fun! bart, don't!"
66568,Marge,but you wear that little spoon around your neck.
55220,Marge,"morning, honey."
56736,Marge,"oh, this place is so big. do you think we should split up and look for them, homie? homie?"
60499,Marge,"no, last week they became vertiqual."
55166,Marge,oh.
64901,Marge,but they were a bad influence on you.
54680,Marge,"homie, someone owes me a back scratch."
60361,Marge,"well, i'll be in the kitchen if you need me."
66781,Marge,how was your day?
64326,Marge,that's. my. son.
58306,Marge,"well, thank you, ralph. you're such a fine young gentleman."
64574,Marge,do you have any safety tips?
66426,Marge,well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
57383,Marge,careful of the apple pie on the seat.
63377,Marge,styrofoam?
56067,Marge,i'll walk.
56942,Marge,where we going? where we going?
61693,Marge,"that was so exciting, yet familiar. like coke with lemon."
55637,Marge,i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
67850,Marge,"now homer, you do have big bones."
62959,Marge,don't give up on buck. there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place.
65171,Marge,nowhere scary!
56109,Marge,"hmm. oh, we're low on milk for maggie. you wanna come with me to the kwik-e-mart?"
64480,Marge,a sport that encourages hand-holding.
59874,Marge,that's all i ask.
66190,Marge,they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks.
56719,Marge,"this? this? no, i - i've just got a touch of the rheumatiz."
66671,Marge,huh. might as well clean this while i'm killing myself.
65113,Marge,he's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
54736,Marge,i have never been so embarrassed in my life.
65732,Marge,"are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
66709,Marge,why do i ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?
61890,Marge,sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
56222,Marge,"hello, mom? fine. you know, abe had a very nice time with you last sunday..."
67948,Marge,bart?! you brought me back to life!
57889,Marge,"good morning, agnes. how's your new son working out?"
64177,Marge,"man, i love saturdays! finally, i can have fun with something i bought for myself -- a new water heater!"
57643,Marge,i need to purchase a brassiere. you kids wait over here in the credit department.
61041,Marge,uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
61075,Marge,"homie, i tried to tell you how i feel, but i can't find the right words. maybe he can."
64669,Marge,good. that'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
63506,Marge,maggie's crying!
56451,Marge,cheer up. so you're not good at sports. it's a very small part of life.
56262,Marge,"oh, here, let me help you."
64867,Marge,i could use some help!
58645,Marge,that's a risk i'm willing to take. so long!
67070,Marge,what are you two doing back there?
55284,Marge,has she kissed you?
56361,Marge,homer.
55384,Marge,whoa!!
66017,Marge,"sweetie, you're just gonna be who you are."
64693,Marge,"well, i am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that."
64827,Marge,why not?
56340,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
67825,Marge,"oh, i don't know, i just dip in and out... i'm only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse..."
66043,Marge,wish i could get a little of that attention.
57775,Marge,me?
63682,Marge,i wonder who that could... beeee!
66331,Marge,"okay, marge simpson, entering the matrix, for a brownie recipe."
54995,Marge,of course. all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe.
58161,Marge,i thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
61931,Marge,"homer, we've gotta get lisa!"
62671,Marge,"""local anahoopi indians believed this stalactite was the finger of tsisnajini, their god of pointing down."""
55641,Marge,oh dear.
58167,Marge,"homie, this whole town runs on a tune! / our churches, our clubs our government too."
58126,Marge,we were robbed?
57085,Marge,"oh, bart."
58271,Marge,four drink minimum?
58276,Marge,i didn't mean any disrespect. i just can't figure it out.
56983,Marge,we better call ned. he has a ladder.
55698,Marge,no.
59395,Marge,"homer, lisa's in that."
58162,Marge,"homer, you sing all the time!"
61870,Marge,you've never had one before?
65250,Marge,"yours, homie. i'm always on yours."
54864,Marge,"that sounds fine, bart."
58773,Marge,i don't know. remember that new year's eve at lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
57090,Marge,goodnight.
61860,Marge,"oh sure, you love me now, but you'll turn."
56464,Marge,i don't care who started it. i don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. we love you both. you're not in competition with each other. repeat. you are not in competition with each other.
60531,Marge,i don't think my daughter should hear this.
65909,Marge,this list is from six years ago.
67829,Marge,"come on, homer. i want you to see what your sick little girl did."
56146,Marge,that was you!
67865,Marge,then i'm in the class?
59452,Marge,"homer, you know i had a gambling problem."
62482,Marge,and i am glad you're okay.
58662,Marge,hip hip--
59017,Marge,nothing.
59940,Marge,"not now, lisa."
64017,Marge,just go!
59664,Marge,that's not true.
67917,Marge,i am glad he's gone.
65041,Marge,and now my son is a bully. can you fix him?
65596,Marge,"well, maybe we should check into a motel."
63673,Marge,"hmm, okay."
67869,Marge,"okay, shoot."
66131,Marge,"couldn't agree more! now, to celebrate... ta-da! pork chops crusted with cheeto dust!"
65461,Marge,"last week that steward brought me extra shampoo... he called me ""lovely lady."""
63349,Marge,"uh... the batter hit it by accident, not by design."
60578,Marge,are you sure you can get your deposit back? it's in pretty bad shape.
66956,Marge,"homer, you're going, too."
63976,Marge,"homie, it's very open-minded of you to have bart's muslim friend's muslim family over."
57833,Marge,bart!
63219,Marge,"i just found this note in bart's room! ""dear mom and dad: me and my girlfriend darcy have gone to utah to get married. f.y.i., she's pregnant""!"
67680,Marge,i'm for equal rights. but do we really need a whole amendment?
63131,Marge,i'll tell you why: christian charity.
67150,Marge,jacques.
62513,Marge,you haven't had any tea.
58819,Marge,"then the bird sang ""i love the night life""... with clever new lyrics."
63949,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil!"
59535,Marge,"hi, little vicki."
60579,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
63201,Marge,"ooh, the count of monte cristo! can we go? we haven't been to any parties since that soirée at the bastille."
59412,Marge,that's a pretty lousy lesson.
58825,Marge,"""i love you... cactus? blobby? upsilon?"" oh, who am i kidding? homer would never surprise me like that."
66112,Marge,"ben, ramona, i wanna tell you something i've learned over ten years of marriage. the secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train."
59964,Marge,where?
64361,Marge,now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
57050,Marge,"did you eat the cookies, maggie."
64062,Marge,"ned please, you're our guest."
60797,Marge,my hair isn't really blue.
59016,Marge,to who?
59108,Marge,"hollywood, here we come!"
66076,Marge,no danishes!
57699,Marge,"i know she's young, but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
64291,Marge,where's your brother?
63897,Marge,"now homer, boys will be boys."
58369,Marge,"i'm really proud of you, homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?"
63883,Marge,he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary.
65649,Marge,"homie, you want to read to maggie before she goes to sleep?"
67700,Marge,yes.
58466,Marge,"wow, a lot of people have pools."
55753,Marge,"aw honey, i know what you're going through. when i was a girl i had a crush on bobby sherman."
58205,Marge,homer!
62553,Marge,did you just vomit in that suit?
57761,Marge,"you did the right thing, sweetheart."
65390,Marge,"professor frink, are you all right?"
64784,Marge,we'll know.
56406,Marge,"are you two bonkers? we almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered."
67230,Marge,"homer, i don't even want to look at you right now."
66923,Marge,you can look now.
57062,Marge,all aboard the sleepy train / to visit mother goose / barty's stop is snoozy lane / to rest his sweet caboose.
60741,Marge,i'm worried homer might do the same thing. what would make a husband lose interest like that?
61986,Marge,"moe? what's up, partner?"
55183,Marge,"well, you know, maybe he's right."
62907,Marge,"wow, she still works here?"
57730,Marge,krabappel?
54925,Marge,"it's your father, he's missing."
64130,Marge,"okay, i want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces."
59057,Marge,who's up for some beers?
56078,Marge,what?
66041,Marge,our first anniversary.
56806,Marge,thanks benevenstanciano.
59807,Marge,that's depressing.
65443,Marge,"care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
56153,Marge,no one's going anywhere. we're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
60990,Marge,"oh, what a magical evening. the moonlight, the music, the water..."
66091,Marge,can you follow everything okay?
57753,Marge,"homer, you didn't tell me mr. burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
57570,Marge,very well. there must be dozens of great locations in this town. don't you worry about me.
56557,Marge,wait. i'm remembering something...
67224,Marge,"okay, but don't dawdle. your food will get cold."
67533,Marge,because i said so.
63390,Marge,it's just flanders. you know him.
56816,Marge,no.
66662,Marge,homer look what someone left in the kitchen. frosty chocolate milkshakes.
56680,Marge,"so homer, how'd you do?"
62961,Marge,leave him alone!
59287,Marge,none of you? really? i could have sworn that ramrod...
62319,Marge,what if there's a fire?
60209,Marge,thanks for understanding.
67504,Marge,lisa's recital is saturday night.
57746,Marge,"besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with bart."
60143,Marge,"no. no, there it is!"
67834,Marge,"oh, all right. if he passes obedience school, we can keep him."
59214,Marge,where'd you get that?
61298,Marge,maggie's locked inside!
60543,Marge,shoo! shoo!
55094,Marge,you're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
66527,Marge,no.
63830,Marge,homie?
58741,Marge,let's call the company.
60860,Marge,that's not a purse. it's a diaper bag.
59800,Marge,what a waste of talent.
55914,Marge,"homer, please. these boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
67634,Marge,some celery with cream cheese on it?
66899,Marge,i want my husband back!
58538,Marge,what are you hiding there?
64782,Marge,why did you do that?
57384,Marge,"grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
63844,Marge,i'll do it!
67871,Marge,kids. remember what i told you about showing a little support.
64342,Marge,"no! when we get you to the safe zone, we can cure your father!"
56613,Marge,"homer, you had a head."
61249,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? even your brother's adding his kudos."
59200,Marge,why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
63413,Marge,elmo!
64272,Marge,"but her teacher, mr. ellsworth toohey, wanted every child to conform."
57417,Marge,"i'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable dos equis bottle. it's about a certain house in our town..."
55107,Marge,"i was thinking that while your father and lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
64435,Marge,time to try out my new deep fryer.
66695,Marge,yes it does!
55199,Marge,"homer, for the last time, i am not putting that in."
62703,Marge,what's wrong with your teeter-totter?
61363,Marge,mr. burns? you care about children?
61371,Marge,i always keep one near the bed for you.
65129,Marge,apology accepted. now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
67214,Marge,eugene fisk? isn't he your assistant?
64887,Marge,i guess i'll never have a perfect christmas.
63809,Marge,thank god they're not jeering at us anymore.
60073,Marge,this reminds me of our shotgun wedding.
57341,Marge,it does seem nicer than springfield.
58866,Marge,"oh, oh, okay, calm down. just think: what would curtis e. bear do?"
65264,Marge,you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.
63553,Marge,"oh, poor johnny stabbo..."
67765,Marge,well... i'll try.
64852,Marge,we know. and we're going to do something about it.
59450,Marge,who cares? he's dishin' out the dirt.
57674,Marge,"i hope you all saved room, because i made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! both kinds!"
64696,Marge,what is it?
60024,Marge,lisa!
58387,Marge,has anyone mentioned that homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
55625,Marge,"you know, i don't think i remember... but the story of lisa's first word is very cute."
60231,Marge,oh no...
66587,Marge,"ooo, i'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. i must still be logged in as him."
56111,Marge,ooh. that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
55621,Marge,"kit-ty? ""kit-ty""?"
54668,Marge,"oh, homie."
54968,Marge,"homer, are you ordering junk off the tv again?"
64459,Marge,"the laundry. the machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it."
54823,Marge,i washed it.
61265,Marge,you punched out three people on the street.
67143,Marge,thank you.
60295,Marge,i don't know how this town got so fat.
67569,Marge,please stop. please. be quiet.
59009,Marge,"no one's gonna jinx you, homer. in fact, we're rooting for you."
59072,Marge,i never knew jim belushi made so many movies.
63379,Marge,"ooh, look! pine-cone first ladies!"
67530,Marge,"well, you won't be watching these cartoons anymore. ever."
62814,Marge,"homer, you can tell the third story. bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest."
56033,Marge,good. i'm glad we had this talk.
66349,Marge,it got sold.
59385,Marge,"oh no, you don't! i'm not going to let you trash mr. burns' yacht."
55924,Marge,what are you doin'?
62969,Marge,"carpool, nelson!"
64596,Marge,of course you do. dylan's a... hm... let me check the invitation...
60285,Marge,why don't you just take britney beers and get outta here!
66256,Marge,"first in freeways... ""the 'yuh-huh' state""... ""jewel of the fracking belt""... ""still a british colony at heart""... ""land of many water snakes""..."
66439,Marge,we don't even get this many christmas cards.
61153,Marge,lousy homer... i'll show him... tonight his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples.
66322,Marge,are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
67250,Marge,homer! you didn't even ask where bart would be going.
55019,Marge,"well, i'll let you know."
58030,Marge,"well, i'm glad you were having fun, because i've had my hands full with apu's mother."
63227,Marge,"oh yes. i'm so proud, i feel my chest might burst. can you edit that? i don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
55216,Marge,"that's nice, bart. you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. but they said he was too heavy."
67544,Marge,"well, that's what we want them to do, homer."
62289,Marge,may eighteenth? that's one week from today!
67483,Marge,mom! you made it! how are you!
67226,Marge,what is the meaning of this?
65641,Marge,"while you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house."
59254,Marge,maggie loves baby talk.
57040,Marge,...go again.
61487,Marge,"oh no no, she says lots of words. like when she wants something, she says"
55917,Marge,what's wrong with this phone? it's making crazy noises.
54734,Marge,i must apologize for my husband.
54742,Marge,i'm going to church alone today. you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life.
56876,Marge,"this is my fault. i tried to teach bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
59853,Marge,i don't know. it came with the house.
57118,Marge,i can't believe otto picked up a 7-10 split. he's phenomenal!
58241,Marge,"willie, i'm not sure we're making any headway here."
61003,Marge,"maggie, give me that!"
64904,Marge,maybe we could get back together...
56455,Marge,i can't even watch. i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
61866,Marge,"hey, kids, i just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. you know what that means -- open lanes!"
57109,Marge,those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
65060,Marge,"he's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
58676,Marge,"well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel."
64023,Marge,hey!
60818,Marge,maggie?
61416,Marge,"boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""temperance was doing the laundry..."""
54991,Marge,"well homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
65071,Marge,"oh, my poor homie."
66096,Marge,show's over! whoo! that turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
59468,Marge,"homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. do you know how dangerous that is?"
64139,Marge,a pimple! not on my day you don't!
54845,Marge,"well, when i used to get stuck like this, i'd go for a bike ride. do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
55549,Marge,we're here for the retirement party.
66831,Marge,"thank you. although, i think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group."
58717,Marge,yeah.
61519,Marge,"homie, that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together. i think he looks a little like you."
62945,Marge,"homer, please!"
65037,Marge,those are pieces of broken glass.
58994,Marge,"now this is a joseph turner. in an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the venetian canals."
63183,Marge,can i go again?
66313,Marge,"homer simpson, this was your doing. and i want you to fix it!"
67123,Marge,and the kids.
67271,Marge,"dear bart, how is france? i don't know why you haven't written. i guess you're just having too much fun."
64842,Marge,it's not up to you. we're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. they'll know the right thing to do.
56475,Marge,"well, that's the babysitter. no one in town will sit for you two anymore. i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."
57285,Marge,now this i like.
62545,Marge,"if i give you money, how is the gift really from you?"
64426,Marge,"and even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. it might be another sister."
58430,Marge,"i love him, too. g'night."
55286,Marge,her manager? that's ridiculous. i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
63174,Marge,my childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
61470,Marge,cubic diamondium?
61388,Marge,"business, what business?"
57259,Marge,why not.
62132,Marge,"you shouted it while we were making love! now look here, mister. i pay the bills, i do the budget, and i'm in charge of the money."
55239,Marge,"hmm, how much will it cost?"
64645,Marge,you said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
62994,Marge,just make it happen!
66651,Marge,oh. now i completely understand you.
64163,Marge,"oh! okay, i'm coming."
61505,Marge,"fine. ""extremely satisfied."""
56648,Marge,coff - ee!
62077,Marge,"well, i've learned a lesson. just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
55504,Marge,fruit is nature's candy!
60675,Marge,my favorite is number three!
66554,Marge,a mother's greatest fear.
63086,Marge,"the story of my life. they get the popsicles, i get the sticks."
56228,Marge,"he's an awful, awful, awful man, but i guess if he makes mom happy, that's all that really matters."
62797,Marge,"noble sir, you may accompany us to america in my late husband's clothing."
57739,Marge,a frying pan radio. wow!
64960,Marge,neither did i. i didn't want to know what color the statue of liberty was. but you know what? i was wrong. and these ladies are too.
58082,Marge,"why, yes it is..."
64869,Marge,next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house.
62998,Marge,what are those noises? they sounded zoological!
60396,Marge,"look, it's great to see you, but you should know i'm happily married."
61777,Marge,"oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
67798,Marge,now this is spoiling them.
55437,Marge,my name is blanche dubois.
60168,Marge,it wasn't meant to be.
55811,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
65439,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, i'm trying to put maggie to sleep!"
62328,Marge,"all right! i admit it -- they're both at the catholic church! reverend, what should i do?"
58545,Marge,"i don't know, and i don't want to know. and i'm going to find out!"
59742,Marge,no! no! get off me!
62110,Marge,"oh, thank god! he's alive!"
56320,Marge,jacques.
65553,Marge,lemme get this straight. none of you had time to take out the garbage?
59294,Marge,"no, no, i mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs."
64716,Marge,first we're visiting grampa.
57270,Marge,"so apu, why didn't you go back to india when your student visa expired?"
55765,Marge,"homer, are you going to the duff brewery?"
55219,Marge,do you think she could be a professional some day?
54613,Marge,have you really read all these books?
57822,Marge,"well, maybe... but i'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
64969,Marge,give me a double espresso to go.
56322,Marge,sure.
57324,Marge,"three! we have three kids, homer!"
65038,Marge,"look, now my son needs your help."
65533,Marge,"our search for culture is thus concluded / for the bard of avon is well-suited / to a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / jeez, i can't stop talking like this."
61222,Marge,"thanks for not killing me, homie. here's an extra pork chop."
61338,Marge,whatever.
61442,Marge,"jack ruby was a man, not a jewel."
62445,Marge,how could you ask me that?
67051,Marge,"well you do, don't you?"
57678,Marge,"i don't, but i loved hearing it!"
61646,Marge,"homie, if i died, would you be sad?"
66768,Marge,"c'mon, maggie. the first ride we go on will be for you."
56665,Marge,"money problems? homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
61346,Marge,"then how would we ever get to see ""camelot""?"
55113,Marge,"well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... and these... oh look! little bow ties."
60255,Marge,you came back!
54643,Marge,steffan!
57333,Marge,that's slick willie for you. always with the smooth talk.
61584,Marge,"well, i love my husband and i'm glad i do. my name is marge s. and i'm a homer-holic!"
61230,Marge,no thanks. i'm wearing my cure for depression.
60004,Marge,they're for after dinner.
63286,Marge,i never have to look out the window again!
65154,Marge,this is the most adorable thing i've ever seen in my entire life!
63641,Marge,i appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. but the truth is... i'm way too successful for you now. i'm gettin' me a trophy husband!
55694,Marge,"homer, no..."
67348,Marge,"wake up bart, rise and shine, little guy. time to wake up."
64841,Marge,"just because mr. burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless."
63161,Marge,sure!
59983,Marge,"bart, i told you not to get your lip disked."
61445,Marge,"henry the eighth had everything he could want, except a son to follow in his footsteps..."
66947,Marge,i think it's under the short leg of the couch.
55794,Marge,lisa needs braces.
62548,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is."
62494,Marge,"our tandem bicycle! when i bought it, you said you'd ride with me."
61780,Marge,don't worry. we'll be fine!
58837,Marge,good lord. how am i supposed to get in this beast?
59415,Marge,i don't see why not.
59121,Marge,i don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
67756,Marge,"thank you, barney. how many people are coming, homer?"
67236,Marge,"yes he does, homer. and when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. you owe your son better than that, homer."
66107,Marge,what the?
59650,Marge,do you have to talk like that?
66401,Marge,they're not coming for another twenty-nine years! did your earlobes get longer?
57267,Marge,bart's room.
62345,Marge,my hive! my trademark hive!
58860,Marge,"oh, great. what'd i do?"
54932,Marge,bingo.
57066,Marge,--- you're gonna get...
67895,Marge,"hmmm, i feel that way about your father."
67045,Marge,"lisa, get away from that jazzman!"
62628,Marge,"homer, that means your dad might not be your dad!"
65478,Marge,"here, right?"
67302,Marge,yeah.
55238,Marge,"well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
58065,Marge,helping people find homes... that must be really rewarding.
64012,Marge,are you saying lisa's not there?
67826,Marge,"ohh, that dog!"
62350,Marge,my christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early.
64443,Marge,tomato!
66219,Marge,you have a baby together?
58351,Marge,"you said this monkey would be sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters. and now he just lies there, struggling to breathe."
60023,Marge,"we've got to get to the hospital, homer!"
55778,Marge,did you say beer or deer?
56762,Marge,bart! lisa! what are you two doing home so early?
55597,Marge,i really think that was the character's name... don quixote!
55964,Marge,hello?
63327,Marge,was there even a baseball game yesterday? i don't remember!
56394,Marge,kids?
64529,Marge,one month? that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
57735,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. here, you can have the junk mail."
56845,Marge,"homer, i'm on duty."
55969,Marge,it's almost nine-thirty!
62344,Marge,"oh bart, i knew one of these dumb things would work!"
60941,Marge,"homer aren't you afraid you might be, i don't know, incurring god's wrath?"
59018,Marge,are you okay?
60929,Marge,"you know, most people pray silently."
65574,Marge,what are you talking about?
67485,Marge,"okay, lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
58370,Marge,who can take this diaper?
56824,Marge,that's better.
64720,Marge,"hm, i think i'll look for a new handbag..."
67074,Marge,"we all are, dear. your father says there's nothing to worry about."
64056,Marge,why are you here? you already own a home.
60974,Marge,"lisa, i'm so impressed you're state champ."
67754,Marge,"no, homer, not over this. no, no."
66221,Marge,it's not good! none of it's good!
65496,Marge,it's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.
63849,Marge,"marge, calm down. for as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. it fills a need, and harms no one."
63937,Marge,really? me? you did?
62991,Marge,he's just drumming louder!
63577,Marge,"homie, i made you my ""killer"" lasagna."
63616,Marge,i'd better join a gym before i go from hippy to hippo.
61625,Marge,"edna's with comic book guy? oh god, she's on the rebound! and you meet the worst guys on the rebound. it's how jackie got her ""o""!"
56932,Marge,it's so quiet here without the kids.
57376,Marge,"that's what i said, foilage . it doesn't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage."
57680,Marge,"oh, homer, please. you're embarrassing yourself."
59396,Marge,let's forget about the band contest and just have fun at the state fair.
63729,Marge,homer jay simpson!
64922,Marge,"yes, you may."
59469,Marge,"i wrote a poem for barney on this special occasion. ""now that you're one year older, the time flew by so fast..."""
55797,Marge,lisa needs braces.
57621,Marge,i guess we're not going to find anyone.
58228,Marge,"no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! all righty, time for bed."
67430,Marge,"did the team ask you to dress like that, homer?"
62245,Marge,"bart, i spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak. have some."
60325,Marge,"no, homer!"
58633,Marge,ohh.
63060,Marge,it's not giant and it's not in the distance! it's small and it's in our room!
67931,Marge,this is really annoying.
59676,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
57921,Marge,"well, grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when bart was five and lisa was three."
57855,Marge,"""you are my sunshine, my only sunshine / you make me happy, when skies are gray / you'll never know, dear / how much i love you / so don't take my sunshine away..."""
64788,Marge,get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! it's picture day tomorrow!
57960,Marge,we're here to eat your kids.
58522,Marge,"easy, easy. stick with the plan."
63225,Marge,"bart, you're too young to get married! you still make me check the closet for the boogeyman!"
61293,Marge,"mr. connor, thank you for helping find my husband. i don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like fritos."""
60863,Marge,why is it ned flanders?
66674,Marge,...so they need a place to stay. here.
58990,Marge,"homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same."
62315,Marge,"bart, get your things. you're leaving with me!"
60878,Marge,"ten, ten, ten, ten..."
62040,Marge,that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
61181,Marge,"oh for god's sake, i can see why he left. now all of you, get cleaning."
67640,Marge,"we've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean, i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but i--"
62134,Marge,did you spend our savings on a motor home?
60838,Marge,that museum has been nothing but trouble since it opened.
67182,Marge,i don't think so.
59814,Marge,"oh. well, you know, lots of people shoot apu. it's just a hundred-dollar fine now."
67679,Marge,"we were seniors in high school, but we had never even met."
59992,Marge,"well, now i've heard everything."
65807,Marge,while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
57230,Marge,"what are you going to do with all your money, mr. lampwick?"
58766,Marge,"wow, look at this place. the house number is spelled out with letters!"
57404,Marge,"and if anything happens, just use your best judgm... just do what i would do."
56436,Marge,"you just answered your own question with that commode mouth. besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
63357,Marge,"okay, okay, you can have it back!"
67708,Marge,yeah!
63967,Marge,homie?
55356,Marge,you mean a spoon?
56242,Marge,today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair.
64440,Marge,you like potato...
56923,Marge,what?! no! you can't! i won't let you!
67787,Marge,"bart! lisa! if you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home."
58975,Marge,yup.
67082,Marge,why... that's my husband!
59127,Marge,"yes, i just thought you might love me enough to let me help you."
67269,Marge,what?
59004,Marge,ohh...
62259,Marge,jimminy kimmel! look how much they're charging for bart's treatment!
61229,Marge,ta-da!
58123,Marge,for once we're gonna celebrate christmas as a family.
66357,Marge,lisa!
58427,Marge,ooh! who's a good boy?
67159,Marge,but...
59217,Marge,"yeah, but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?"
63890,Marge,oh my god. you've taught me a valuable lesson!
66285,Marge,this is fun! and it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
59862,Marge,"homer, ball!"
64353,Marge,that does sound like homer.
66712,Marge,those were your father's sweatpants.
57250,Marge,"hello?... oh, homie, hello! i can't remember the last time you called me from -- oh, you want to speak to lisa?"
62629,Marge,"homie, what's wrong? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?"
58632,Marge,"ohh, you don't sound so good. we'd better get you some cold medicine."
66810,Marge,we love you!
60029,Marge,"hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
65206,Marge,"yeah, you always do. well, here's where to meet us..."
58580,Marge,"homer, do something! the ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!"
57994,Marge,"c'mon, kids. we're goin' home."
64755,Marge,this is that videogame reverend lovejoy said you shouldn't play!
58366,Marge,"homer, this has gone far enough. will you please just apologize to the garbage men?"
64038,Marge,...of school!
56585,Marge,"all right, all right. it's lisa's turn."
60017,Marge,let's just say that bart did it.
64087,Marge,"oooo, jazz!"
66358,Marge,where could bart be?
56842,Marge,"i'm still all those things. only now i'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
64242,Marge,every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage.
66805,Marge,"homie, i've missed you!"
63954,Marge,you make me feel that way too.
58405,Marge,but--
56136,Marge,"homie, you should be proud. only a handful of people have done what you've done."
54629,Marge,there will too be women astronauts!
61905,Marge,"you know, chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place."
58009,Marge,are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
59717,Marge,do you want turkey sausage or ham?
54708,Marge,this sure beats slaving over a hot stove!
58699,Marge,dust!!!
60091,Marge,that voice could use a little personality.
57091,Marge,"i always thought i understood my special little guy. but somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine."
61564,Marge,isn't that a little big?
67201,Marge,destiny?
67279,Marge,all this senseless violence. i don't understand its appeal.
67797,Marge,i really hope we're not spoiling them.
56323,Marge,never.
65742,Marge,"would you... like to have coffee, or dinner, or just talk?"
65782,Marge,it all makes sense now.
62555,Marge,i'd better wash that thing. it's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
58335,Marge,"you really had a lot of talent, kid."
61142,Marge,"that's okay. i can handle it. homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?"
66562,Marge,maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
67802,Marge,"hmmm, lisa, you don't look well."
59948,Marge,yeah. the uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
63321,Marge,i'm also pleased!
58814,Marge,my darling bride manjula / i hereby mend my ways / i'll shower you with valentines / for seven love-filled days!
62186,Marge,"oh, homie..."
54749,Marge,"grampa, could you do something?"
64469,Marge,oh my god!
60799,Marge,it takes six hours to make breakfast now.
67929,Marge,apu?
67325,Marge,this is fun!
64783,Marge,you're alive?
64876,Marge,"this tree reminds me of your father. it's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it."
67001,Marge,"homer, this is our house."
64251,Marge,i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth.
64157,Marge,you want to know the score? i'll tell you the score.
61312,Marge,"that's a very violent image, lisa."
61614,Marge,this is so sad.
62842,Marge,now this is a house that's ready to be cleaned!
66504,Marge,"after thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right."
62968,Marge,carpool!
63599,Marge,"you really don't know, do you?"
56882,Marge,"i must say mr. burns is being awfully inconsiderate. selfish, even."
59612,Marge,"oh. well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. except you cutting my brakes!"
59073,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open."
61696,Marge,"well, whoever he is, the pie man would never cave in to blackmail."
54816,Marge,"homer, it's the thought that counts. the moral of this story is, ""a good deed is its own reward."""
67674,Marge,"and a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
67053,Marge,"go on, bart. no time like the present."
62763,Marge,"charles, please -- your son might see this."
60866,Marge,sorry!
63239,Marge,james patterson!
65228,Marge,if you kissed her that would be lovely.
62210,Marge,"come on, kids! we're gonna visit grampa. then we're gonna take the dog to the v-e-t..."
67879,Marge,"mr. burns, she's just a baby."
66689,Marge,homer! homer. i think there's someone downstairs.
60657,Marge,that commercial is very effective.
54738,Marge,shhh.
62167,Marge,"let's see. there's ""equus"" starring sideshow mel... ""the three dollar bills in 'gay, gay, gay!'""... ooh, ""song of shelbyville""!"
56353,Marge,"there's that side of it. but there's also... help me out here, lisa."
62532,Marge,"bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
57618,Marge,"homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one."
64979,Marge,but you said going from blue to gray was empowering.
62528,Marge,me neither. oh my god! i took the salesman's pen. i'll be right back.
65444,Marge,"i'm sorry, sweetie. maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""mr. steak."""
65232,Marge,that's because it would kill you.
59510,Marge,those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
56338,Marge,"i made the right decision to stay with my homie, and there was no harm done. so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
63694,Marge,"unfortunately, as i later learned, that wasn't heroin. it was insulin."
59301,Marge,"homer, stop! no, you don't understand!"
67410,Marge,what!
57875,Marge,"stay where i can see you, honey..."
66953,Marge,"bart, this is a big day for you. why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?"
62913,Marge,"ooh, it's a mugger! i'll hand over all my hugs and kisses!"
57794,Marge,"now, ned, troubled boys need rules and discipline. they crave it! you just lay down the law."
65260,Marge,i hereby declare thanksgiving dinner officially over!
61778,Marge,and white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
58222,Marge,"i can't go along with this, homer."
63746,Marge,we accept!
55095,Marge,homer!
65891,Marge,"uh, i'm thinking of getting maggie swimming lessons."
64811,Marge,"uh-huh, yeah. here's your breakfast."
54986,Marge,but i guess i was wrong. you are a bad father.
58623,Marge,"oh, lord."
63911,Marge,"homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!"
64843,Marge,"mr. burns, you can't hurt us after all we've done for you."
63272,Marge,this is a celebrity scandal! we could sell that photo to a tabloid.
65745,Marge,"no, homie! it's too dangerous!"
64896,Marge,sounds pretty good.
62383,Marge,ooo.
61849,Marge,he's got the measles. but we've got him on speakerphone!
55803,Marge,"doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. so we'll need something a little more... affordable."
60658,Marge,"well, they're both lovely."
57583,Marge,"hey, what's going on?"
66963,Marge,"well, come on, you two. don't forget about the film festival."
55466,Marge,"homer, please. don't make me choose between my man and my god, because you just can't win."
66871,Marge,but you don't go to our church.
59524,Marge,"homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for you."
55529,Marge,we're home.
67542,Marge,"""... in your otherwise fine programming. yours truly, marge simpson."""
58390,Marge,"oh, homie! you're alive!"
55245,Marge,you are not going to perform that operation yourself.
67033,Marge,"so tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. you'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
55400,Marge,"hi, ned. i didn't know you were an actor."
66036,Marge,how am i going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
56418,Marge,homer! homie? hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.
67022,Marge,bart!
66679,Marge,"if someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it?"
62117,Marge,"oh, this is only based on a story. a true story!"
59492,Marge,take 'em off the glass! take 'em off the glass!
61233,Marge,win your own t-shirt!
58978,Marge,is everything okay? i got worried when i didn't hear any shots.
66297,Marge,i was just trying to do the right thing! who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
54874,Marge,how long does it take to deliver a pizza?
65447,Marge,"just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie."
62136,Marge,"kids, come back in the house!"
56601,Marge,why do you say that?
62645,Marge,i guess -- they're homer's expired pain medications.
65253,Marge,"no more tv! we're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the museum... of television."
63137,Marge,no!
60236,Marge,"you know, lisa, around here, buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
65617,Marge,grampa's army footlocker! i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
64269,Marge,"ooo, ""the fountainhead."""
63459,Marge,"well, where should we go for brunch?"
56996,Marge,"homer, we need to have a serious talk."
62032,Marge,"homie, i think you did great. and to celebrate, i made omelets from the eggs people threw at our house."
54655,Marge,my hair!
63018,Marge,"aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
57067,Marge,ninety-nine cents!
55252,Marge,"we all have to make sacrifices, dear. maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
64292,Marge,bart simpson! i'm glad your father isn't here to see this!
66539,Marge,those are past-due bills.
55871,Marge,i'll miss you too homie.
55169,Marge,"well, good. i'm coming home, honey. you can pick me up at the train station in an hour. and bring the kids. bye!"
59139,Marge,i think you misheard me.
56514,Marge,this isn't very erotic. i think it's an actual utility room.
55835,Marge,"hello, principal dondelinger."
63991,Marge,now you know how i'll feel when you go to college.
65346,Marge,"all right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?"
62765,Marge,well...
57787,Marge,"come right this way, mel. i... tim, hold my calls."
58768,Marge,"and there's ed begley, jr."
60101,Marge,oh my!
67662,Marge,homer!
62224,Marge,"hey boy, want a treat?"
56463,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
60169,Marge,"new underpants? homer, what are you up to?"
56523,Marge,i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth yet.
61465,Marge,you'll be like an owl saying milhouse who? milhouse who? milhouse whooo?
61462,Marge,"well, i'm sure he'll be happy you came."
56501,Marge,"oh, bart. it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
60564,Marge,"homer, these people are professional roasters. don't give them fodder!"
62463,Marge,homer!
65953,Marge,fine. i'll just get rid of these itchy and mitchys.
64989,Marge,go! save yourselves!
66209,Marge,first few weeks of what?
67171,Marge,hmmm.
64473,Marge,"okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. and... now!"
67412,Marge,huh uh. i'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night.
62598,Marge,no wine for her -- she's only eight!
59989,Marge,"oh, no! it's eating us!"
56396,Marge,it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over.
64429,Marge,"a bird eating potato chips... my feet walking... that boy who got sick on the tram... grampa talking to a mermaid hedge... the park rules in spanish... a fat baby... grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch... oops, i erased them all!"
60107,Marge,that sounds like a lie.
65695,Marge,fine. just stay here and hold down the fort.
64067,Marge,genie.
66687,Marge,you always do the right thing... sort of.
67235,Marge,"i've been thinking, homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? you taught bart a very bad lesson. your boy idolizes you."
67550,Marge,i can protect my own children.
63242,Marge,the family can't start the day without me!
66015,Marge,thank you!
63479,Marge,we're trapped. your fans will rip us to pieces.
56216,Marge,"homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?!"
54720,Marge,"c'mon, marge, it's either you, or..."
64195,Marge,"well, i'll make you forget all about it."
64893,Marge,what's going on? i called the prison and they won't tell me where homer is!
64584,Marge,you people are so pushy.
63953,Marge,she's not here!?
65061,Marge,i was never sure about this marriage.
58336,Marge,they want you to spy on your friends?
65460,Marge,"bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths."
62685,Marge,i can see there's only one way to turn you into human beings again.
67888,Marge,i thought there was some good in everybody until i met him.
60727,Marge,"well, make sure you don't. and try not to let your brother get under your skin."
58365,Marge,"homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
59737,Marge,yeah?
62656,Marge,"sweetie, if someone's bullying you, you should tell your teacher."
65177,Marge,they're selling cds in the restaurant.
63771,Marge,no suicide axe!
67240,Marge,homer!
58997,Marge,homer... homer...
64220,Marge,"you know what a girl likes, mister. so, can i see you again?"
67689,Marge,"i'm sorry, i don't even know your name."
56638,Marge,oh my.
67114,Marge,"well, isn't this nice?"
64936,Marge,now it's ready for garbage!
64864,Marge,well we've gotta buy something!
64840,Marge,thank god mr. burns isn't alive to see this.
67056,Marge,"well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. it's what shows up on the surface that counts. that's what my mother taught me. take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. and then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow."
54959,Marge,"well, it's a lot. in fact, your father had to take a second job."
60274,Marge,here's the keys.
59368,Marge,"that's not an award, that's part of the set."
61251,Marge,"principal skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?"
64073,Marge,"you know, it says here that grampa has to remain in the house, but we don't. how about a family outing?"
57189,Marge,"no, no, no! not tonight! no vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. just be good."
63578,Marge,you're a killer for hire!
59283,Marge,"thank you, ramrod."
61991,Marge,"homer, can you hold my wedding ring for a second? my finger's itchy."
62690,Marge,"there, there... the fact that you tried means everything."
57381,Marge,there's not enough room!
66773,Marge,homer! you have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!
65375,Marge,"well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good."
57541,Marge,"please, let's just go to sleep."
64472,Marge,"so if you go for oysters and i go for ersters, i'll order oysters and cancel the ersters / for we know we need each other so we / better call the calling off off, / let's call the whole thing ooooofff!"
66077,Marge,i want to be very clear. i'm a happily married woman. going on ten years. the aluminum anniversary! nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
58319,Marge,"nnno, that stinks. let me try one."
55339,Marge,"i know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
66670,Marge,"so. he likes ghosts better, eh? fine."
63798,Marge,i love documentaries! especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
55040,Marge,"oh, homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
61213,Marge,all the time. sometimes i bring them lemonade.
62846,Marge,my head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
58784,Marge,"he's also thankful for your bounty, lord."
54774,Marge,"so, did you kids have fun?"
61287,Marge,"homer, there's no rear on that thing."
58132,Marge,how do you think i felt?
63502,Marge,"okay, i'll sign up."
60407,Marge,"remember, homie. i'm doing this for us. see you on monday."
62776,Marge,maybe homer brush teeth first...
63339,Marge,i always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. but now i know it's the truth.
57459,Marge,remember? luann and chase are taking us out to hear spalding gray.
61576,Marge,get away from me!
56036,Marge,"oh, thank you."
61451,Marge,"when winter came, lewis and clark tried to set up camp, but encountered much hardship."
56261,Marge,"homer, what happened to you?"
55995,Marge,me too.
67308,Marge,not to worry.
59161,Marge,"you know, homie, the ""e"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
57650,Marge,"it's not your fault, homer. it's those lousy writers. they make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
58344,Marge,hmf. the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
64016,Marge,you probably would.
64767,Marge,that's crazy talk!
63014,Marge,"homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?"
61597,Marge,six feet by eight?
66598,Marge,"so, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?"
58063,Marge,i'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
63663,Marge,...anus! ...anus! ...anus!
58590,Marge,"nothing, nothing."
58117,Marge,why do you always wait until christmas eve to do your shopping? the crowds are just beastly.
61231,Marge,my heart is fine.
64324,Marge,nobody needs to know that! skip ahead!
56231,Marge,"we're all aware of grampa's problems, but compared to mr. burns, he's judge freaking reinhold!"
58609,Marge,but that's not what p.e.t.a. stands--
56110,Marge,"well, i guess we could go to that new monstromart..."
55333,Marge,"i know we didn't ask for this, homer, but doesn't the bible say, ""whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
63591,Marge,"but some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay."
67767,Marge,then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...
62702,Marge,"hmm, well, then maybe i will come by more often. and homer can spend more time with our kids... he's watching them now!"
61054,Marge,bird...
58252,Marge,what business enterprise?
57645,Marge,"'morning, roy!"
58179,Marge,you're just going into our backyard. no one will see you.
54758,Marge,"he blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
58927,Marge,i'm trying to find a particular tune. it's the one that goes like dah-da-dahhh dah-da-dahhh.
57606,Marge,can't you get it yourself?
62803,Marge,we're not engaged.
66930,Marge,"homer, you tell me that all the time."
65844,Marge,abe... we found your storage locker.
66774,Marge,there's only one fair solution: we have to put it to a vote.
60421,Marge,unless...
61120,Marge,"oh, a mom's work is never done."
58769,Marge,"oh, my lord! i feel like cinderella."
63273,Marge,and they pay big money for photos.
60134,Marge,"i don't mean to be disrespectful, judge harm, but we are not bad parents. and there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
62196,Marge,"oh, i am so glad you think so."
61808,Marge,i hope the ovenfresh bake-off likes them as much as you do.
55419,Marge,"homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
62064,Marge,because she's bringing over someone very special. her fiancée.
59926,Marge,"well, homie, i believe you're telling the truth about the isotopes."
63351,Marge,are bees building hives in your diaper genie?...
57521,Marge,...we had a fight?
64224,Marge,"and i've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment."
59097,Marge,were you or lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
65527,Marge,"homer, that sounds like ""the sweet smell of success""."
67769,Marge,not to me.
61936,Marge,"i'm coming, sweetheart!"
64849,Marge,who's a possum? you're a possum.
56885,Marge,i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.
61436,Marge,well... there is a place called nantucket.
64071,Marge,he won't come over!
59770,Marge,lenny says we've got the day off! yippee!
58431,Marge,"homer, don't look."
63210,Marge,you should feel lucky. not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
62787,Marge,"it's a book about management, and lee iacocca says it's ""definitely, dot dot dot useful."""
59585,Marge,that was a movie.
61575,Marge,"look, i'm not sure this place is working. the drinkers are smoking, the smokers are drinking, and the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves."
59627,Marge,"hey, you've been riding me all day. why don't you poop in your hat?"
55288,Marge,fine. see if i care.
54937,Marge,"homer, if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her."
67559,Marge,no one.
57163,Marge,"yes. they're better. socially better. and if we fit in, we can be better too. so today, while the rest of you were out being different, i did a very good job of fitting in. so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass. they might even ask us to join!"
57579,Marge,"hello? uh, no, pretzel wagon's no longer -- three hundred pretzels?! wait, wait, let me get this down. mmm... mmm... meatpackers union hall... batavia, new york... i'll send them right out! homer, homie, wake up! wake up, i'm back in business!"
65841,Marge,"your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year."
67518,Marge,"gee, i never realized tv was such a dangerous influence."
61558,Marge,"oh, my head!"
67672,Marge,"homer. it's not the end of the world. you know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
67621,Marge,"i'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
60823,Marge,"ooh, these turtles know just where the knots are. it just shows you god has a plan for every creature."
58611,Marge,"ankle? ""foccacia""? what are you talking about?"
58453,Marge,"oh, this is so naughty. coming back to our old love nest..."
66199,Marge,what's going on?
67851,Marge,"oh, homer, don't be jealous. i was a schoolgirl, the beatles were very popular and i had a crush on them."
59258,Marge,you have octuplets. it rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
65946,Marge,"homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married."
60326,Marge,you'll be condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes!
59834,Marge,i know... but the lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance.
66542,Marge,"oh! oh no, you're right, homer! abort! abort!"
55411,Marge,ba-ba?
61666,Marge,"yeah, i've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone."
60593,Marge,"tonight, we invite both manjula and apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming."
58497,Marge,oh?
66681,Marge,but our water was on fire.
63675,Marge,aren't you going to drink?
64235,Marge,"although, i am gonna miss our little love nest."
64028,Marge,oh my god. he's talking to me.
57857,Marge,"homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
66567,Marge,"krusty, i brought some homemade chicken soup. we used the play-doh maker for the matzo."
56364,Marge,my prom date.
65231,Marge,you make electricity. it runs the hospital!
63192,Marge,how did you make it?
60191,Marge,oh my god! dinner with burly!
56868,Marge,"this is a springfield isotopes cap. when you wear it, you're wearing springfield. when you eat a fish from our river, you're eating springfield. when you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking springfield."
62244,Marge,that's right -- you're all crooks!
66367,Marge,"look, i'm really not comfortable talking about s-e-x with k-i-d-s."
63331,Marge,you traded our mattress? i had my secret cash in it!
61082,Marge,"nobody owns christmas carols. they belong to everyone, like grapes at the grocery store!"
55189,Marge,uh... that's okay.
64773,Marge,the pie was poisoned. you were right! i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
65591,Marge,now i'm thinking alex if it's a girl and xander if it's a boy.
59061,Marge,"well, maybe for your wedding!"
67320,Marge,except for one thing... no chaperone.
55115,Marge,see how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
67327,Marge,you'll see.
57141,Marge,it is.
56020,Marge,i told you this was a bad idea!
56728,Marge,here.
63888,Marge,no. all i care about is finding my boy. and then i'm never letting him out of my sight again...
56077,Marge,think before you say each word.
60200,Marge,"hmmm. and, bart is set for the week."
57475,Marge,or swindling our neighbors.
62149,Marge,i'll have you know i could have married sideshow mel!
56944,Marge,"so, what was it like at the flanders' house?"
67512,Marge,"hmmm, well, thank you. gee, everyone's so nice here at the monster truck rally. look, homer, champagne!"
58798,Marge,"mmm, oh, this is delicious. what's in it?"
56945,Marge,"aw, honey, you're not a monster."
60304,Marge,don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
57157,Marge,"well, we're not."
61397,Marge,i know -- i got your message.
57318,Marge,"no! now park your keister, meester!"
59037,Marge,homer! don't you think you're spoiling...
60960,Marge,"oh honey, i can't believe this is happening. i'll miss you so much."
55263,Marge,you can pet the cat.
60206,Marge,you found a corpse when you were twelve? no wonder you've been so traumatized.
61500,Marge,lisa!
60683,Marge,"they look like you, they were rude to patty and selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
65675,Marge,made? why didn't you just buy him a toy?
65202,Marge,but there weren't four musketeers...
61236,Marge,"you always go with your gut. this time, why don't you listen to your brain?"
56129,Marge,"you know, homer, when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions. first i was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
66021,Marge,"i always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!"
60718,Marge,"why is he performing the duties of a roadie? am i saying that right, ""roadie?"""
63623,Marge,switch stations!
63048,Marge,is that the cat?
60174,Marge,putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. fruit roll-ups for bart... beer roll-ups for homer...
56157,Marge,you're not done. i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides.
55987,Marge,"oh, that's nice."
67866,Marge,"well, thank you, professor lombardo."
65210,Marge,"eh, save it for the sitter!"
55815,Marge,bart!
63197,Marge,"no, france."
54639,Marge,"oh, thanks. it's just a note from my boyfriend."
59987,Marge,look!
61262,Marge,that sounds great -- but only if your father promises to behave.
56187,Marge,you know we should really stop hiring him.
56178,Marge,"i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors. ah, one more."
67924,Marge,"uh, gee homer, don't quit..."
64501,Marge,"c'mon, baby!"
54715,Marge,that'll stop her from seeing him.
66765,Marge,i thought i had one of those chirping keys.
56717,Marge,"all right!!! lisa, that's wonderful. if only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
58904,Marge,that was a horrible trick to play on your mother!
58087,Marge,"well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
55009,Marge,that's very clever.
59098,Marge,"besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. people magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... homer, let's make love!"
61855,Marge,it's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
55581,Marge,it's 9:30 in the morning.
61234,Marge,"oh, relax. i'm sure it's just your brain going crazy."
62634,Marge,"see, abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
64010,Marge,i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet.
64383,Marge,nuzzle... neck. with pleasure!
65256,Marge,"oh ralph, fred, archie, king of queens, i mean homer."
57022,Marge,"mother simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
57434,Marge,school. school.
66354,Marge,i don't have any diamonds.
59218,Marge,oh.
60550,Marge,and now i'm guilty of possession! i could go to prison! unless i testify against you...
54711,Marge,darn these long bank lines. although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. darn these long bank lines.
55901,Marge,"oh, what a cute convertible. you guys at the bureau thought of everything."
64077,Marge,i can't miss out! just one little peek.
58651,Marge,"well, lobster or no lobster, this is still a very special dinner. ba-da da-da da-daaa!"
57766,Marge,the dump?
60048,Marge,it's a miracle!
67482,Marge,you knew that i was cooking a turkey.
56529,Marge,let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off!
63157,Marge,gil?!!
67828,Marge,hm.
59455,Marge,we're not giving you money.
65560,Marge,no one stays in the sinkhole!
66985,Marge,do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
63725,Marge,that quick talking is never a good sign.
58868,Marge,how could they take away my license? it feels like i lost a limb.
59551,Marge,"see, honey? all you needed was to believe in..."
58460,Marge,but think of the scandal.
55198,Marge,"that's disgusting. and besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
56028,Marge,"that video really opened my eyes. i can see that i'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. by nagging you when you do foolish things, i just enable your life-script."
56082,Marge,"homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
64939,Marge,just hope the kids didn't hear us.
55802,Marge,"president of the union! i'm so proud of you, homie."
57420,Marge,"oh, geez -- it's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! it's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
58808,Marge,either put that book down or let me drive.
61787,Marge,"homie, when i married you, i knew we wouldn't live in luxury."
67696,Marge,i'm sorry.
63464,Marge,i'm not cooking!
56006,Marge,yeah. everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
60122,Marge,no! i don't want you going in a bottle. that's what hobos do.
67556,Marge,how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week?
67007,Marge,"homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?"
59242,Marge,homer!
59727,Marge,"once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
57389,Marge,and what's that hitchhiker doing here? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
64943,Marge,i've got summer squash!
61245,Marge,"honey, you could be popular, you've just got to be yourself... in a whole new way."
67454,Marge,"now, just a minute."
66750,Marge,you can't smoke!
57443,Marge,"lisa, quick. screw these back on."
59267,Marge,ohhhhh.
59758,Marge,they always say they're innocent. it's such a turn-off.
61108,Marge,"homie, get out of that treehouse!"
67527,Marge,humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?
58746,Marge,locked.
55857,Marge,"now, hurry up or you'll miss your bus."
64276,Marge,and on the very top floor was a daycare center...
67336,Marge,"soup's on! hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top."
64499,Marge,boo yeah!
55859,Marge,"grampa, you know you can't have liquids after three p.m."
55485,Marge,"homer, those are ice cream men."
64821,Marge,is it a girl?
57622,Marge,that's carl.
64054,Marge,and what will i cook that soup on?
65170,Marge,"why do old squirrels always crawl into my engine to die? guess we'll be making an unscheduled pit stop, gang."
59904,Marge,"where have you been, young man? it's nearly bedtime."
57054,Marge,go crazy?
63776,Marge,"uh, yeah..."
64454,Marge,lettuce who?
55518,Marge,"homer, we have a problem here."
61218,Marge,"homie, i disagree with your approach to the children."
66327,Marge,yoink!
60193,Marge,i will!
62829,Marge,since then i haven't been able to do any of the calculus i've encountered in my daily life. but that's not going to happen to you.
56369,Marge,it's shaped like a diner. and it's on this really tall pole.
63152,Marge,don't you defend him! i want that mooch out of my house right now!
64647,Marge,what do you think?
57430,Marge,"so, twiggy, i hear you and your husband woody just had a baby. what did you name him?"
64747,Marge,what about bart's feelings?
58256,Marge,how about compuglobal hypermeganet?
67882,Marge,doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
57542,Marge,"no, i'm not."
55867,Marge,will you excuse me while i go and freshen up?
55423,Marge,"heah you ah, homah."
66574,Marge,the doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. go to bed. i'll take care of him.
61917,Marge,that's better.
62664,Marge,on the back of your head.
62682,Marge,"if you all don't drop your guns and behave, no one gets the gold."
65164,Marge,what if... we roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
54671,Marge,oh homie! / oh homie!
66155,Marge,i said go!
56776,Marge,"ah, here you go, precious. now go off with your friends."
59860,Marge,and it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
64580,Marge,what's he gonna do now?
55138,Marge,"videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, homer's dry-cleaning -- i think that's everything."
65168,Marge,"you're right, you're right, you're right -- let's go."
59405,Marge,it's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both lynda carter and george foreman.
60505,Marge,homer! they must have made a mistake. we'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
62593,Marge,"hello. i'm marge. this is my husband homer, my daughters lisa and maggie and my son -- bart simpson."
61315,Marge,perfect! i'll take it.
62949,Marge,this house is spectacular. you must have had a great view of the riots!
62515,Marge,"well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake."
64627,Marge,"i don't know... i'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives, and this room isn't really the best place for maggie to hang out."
55724,Marge,that's nice.
62042,Marge,thanksgiving's not for months.
65495,Marge,this is my third favorite wedding supply store!
66309,Marge,"kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
56333,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
66148,Marge,"i'm engaged to you, my love."
62914,Marge,"okay, be cool. i've got some candy in my purse..."
66413,Marge,"that's okay sweetheart. your pig thingy didn't mean it. it's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched tv, there was art going on behind us."
66609,Marge,uh-huh!
57382,Marge,i just don't think it's a good idea.
58648,Marge,come on! chuck him in!
65825,Marge,i lost my other earring.
55749,Marge,"homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?"
64492,Marge,homie! we're going to vancouver!
56068,Marge,yeah.
54897,Marge,"oh hello, mrs. pennycandy."
65380,Marge,"homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?"
57818,Marge,"homer, why aren't you at work?"
58515,Marge,"hey, listen to this!"
63997,Marge,"say ""yes"" say ""yes""!"""
56126,Marge,"well, we respect you."
65299,Marge,"now, lisa tell your side of the story. and use your big voice."
55586,Marge,"but i think i'm allergic to seafood. the last time i ate shrimp, my throat closed up and i went into convulsions."
60484,Marge,"oh, where could your father be?"
62874,Marge,"i don't know. i should give homer a chance... but on the other hand, i feel nothing for him."
58896,Marge,"what is it, honey?"
62228,Marge,what are you doing? why aren't you fixing the roof?
65869,Marge,i never made that noise in my life!
63977,Marge,"so, how did you two meet?"
65031,Marge,there's one right here!
59493,Marge,this looks like a terrible place to relax. we're gonna get you to a--
62566,Marge,the nationwide social organization for women of a certain age?
59198,Marge,"oh, no!"
61085,Marge,why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
65950,Marge,"thank you for finding it, sweetie. and seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself."
57595,Marge,"oh, i don't hate you for failing. i love you for trying."
61428,Marge,did you like it?
61714,Marge,uggams!
60489,Marge,"ooh, did you say joan van ark?"
55106,Marge,bart?
59631,Marge,swings!
56317,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
60859,Marge,oh god! oh god! oh god!
67839,Marge,"say goodbye to grampa, everyone."
62694,Marge,"ooh, carl."
57288,Marge,oh. here we go.
57967,Marge,wouldn't we all suffocate?
58573,Marge,"well, we're leaving. and remember, no itchy and scratchy. i better take these batteries just to be sure."
64420,Marge,mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
57862,Marge,"wake up, everyone. we're almost there."
61174,Marge,"nelson, leggings?"
63562,Marge,"well this mom is not going to say bug-eye. i mean, goodbye."
64169,Marge,"she's beautiful, moe."
61061,Marge,"a little bit, yeah."
55029,Marge,"actually, she was singing about god."
62227,Marge,"how you feeling, sweetie?"
60926,Marge,that's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
55568,Marge,"well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
66788,Marge,"homer, i have to use the porta potty."
67877,Marge,"now, homer, don't worry. all i need to do is find mr. burns' inner beauty."
59487,Marge,"oh, honey, don't panic. if you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
60560,Marge,why are you keeping that thing?
62630,Marge,"homie, you just met this british man. it's too soon to get so emotionally invested."
63778,Marge,"no, no, that's just our old christmas decorations."
66812,Marge,homer!
63838,Marge,they took my cupcakes!
66566,Marge,"homer, get up!"
55540,Marge,"well, it's been two months. you laid down the law and i'm proud of you. but i think we've gotten through to him."
64046,Marge,"we can discuss it later. right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
63304,Marge,hm... needs more goat soul.
58943,Marge,"who cares?! no one could ever get sick of this song. ""suddenly appear..."""
67039,Marge,but they sent a note from school.
62347,Marge,"homer, before i take the kids, i want you to swear you're not up to something."
64999,Marge,"and remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. save lust and rage for me and the kids."
60108,Marge,hello police? i think my house killed my husband.
55429,Marge,"keep yelling, you big ape."
64086,Marge,"good night, lisa. good ni-ight!"
58268,Marge,"ooo, diego's not gonna like that."
64456,Marge,"homie? homie, can you hear me?"
59794,Marge,"try to focus on something else. umm... you like jimi hendrix, right?"
66051,Marge,i just put all my personal information on their website!
55594,Marge,"oh, please don't. for me?"
65633,Marge,sh! here comes lisa's solo!
58457,Marge,we're trapped!
60323,Marge,i was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
57811,Marge,"""marge"" is already taken? oh, how about ""marjorie""?"
61448,Marge,"in 1804, president jefferson..."
60334,Marge,"it may contain brief rudeness, adult explosions, and scenes with garry shandling."
59343,Marge,"oh, i don't know, honey. i've got a lot of therapy left."
63082,Marge,i've been doing the same thing for the last ten years. and all i have to show for it is a clean floor.
56030,Marge,"homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
60932,Marge,"homer, for the last time..."
57597,Marge,"don't worry, kids. this is a national park. we can have lots of fun."
67916,Marge,it's me!
59718,Marge,i'm proud that you won the pulitzer...
65108,Marge,"actually, sometimes you do push ned around."
65530,Marge,just once i'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good.
58022,Marge,what?!
59268,Marge,"oh, look at all that sweet n' low."
60958,Marge,"homer, don't make things worse."
66431,Marge,"if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? we were just trying to be... kind."
56063,Marge,"i wonder if they have a lost and found. oh, what the hey."
59262,Marge,"knock, knock!"
57205,Marge,"sweetheart, maybe you just want krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. i went through the same thing when lyndon johnson died."
54918,Marge,"good morning, dear."
56490,Marge,oh really?
67449,Marge,was he angry?
60182,Marge,spill it...
63653,Marge,of course.
59959,Marge,how are you supposed to dial?
56980,Marge,just a second!
60145,Marge,let's do this thing.
63010,Marge,"bart, here's a letter from your school!"
62602,Marge,uh-oh. he's getting that stabby look.
60679,Marge,"homie, you've been such a sweetheart today. let's go upstairs and..."
58930,Marge,the light's on. all systems are ding-dong!
58477,Marge,"i'm sure they didn't ""ditch"" you, honey. maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you."
67422,Marge,"homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them."
58843,Marge,"well, that's a first. i've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before."
55788,Marge,but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red...
61156,Marge,"oh homie, you got everyone in springfield here for me!"
63510,Marge,"maggie, what can i get you for breakfas-- oh. you did everything yourself."
59012,Marge,i'm not thinking that!
65021,Marge,this place even has its own arts district! with football-hating intellectuals!
62683,Marge,"and why do you really want it, anyway? moe, will the gold bring back edna's love?"
67008,Marge,"all our money, the college funds, the tv. homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you."
57329,Marge,it saved our marriage!
54989,Marge,"homie, why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him? i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
61806,Marge,"in the ovenfresh bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. so i'm entering my dessert dogs!"
67334,Marge,"oh, homer, don't say that. the way i see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
60288,Marge,why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
64661,Marge,what are you doing?! you're indoors at an outdoor party!
59796,Marge,wow. the artist really captured jimi's passion and intensity.
66842,Marge,"i've printed out our driving plan! if we work together, we can get bart to his sports...lisa to her music...and maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today."
55670,Marge,can't you do something for him?
61004,Marge,how much longer is this going to go on?
66575,Marge,"/ no good, no good. what do i do? what do i do?"
64065,Marge,"well, let's see what else is in the job jar."
57412,Marge,i'm third generation.
60354,Marge,"well, he would eat all the time. we'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of hershey's miniatures."
56711,Marge,"well, homer."
61797,Marge,i think you used too much plaster.
61783,Marge,simpson.
56500,Marge,don't turn on the light! don't turn on the light!
54947,Marge,i am very upset with you.
63788,Marge,stop the wedding!
56191,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
56223,Marge,"grampa, sssh! i know my mother. if you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away."
67103,Marge,"no! look, i don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. lisa, bart, what did you two learn in sunday school today?"
61592,Marge,"homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. homer!"
65587,Marge,i can't believe we're never going to have another child...
63241,Marge,i overslept!
60173,Marge,uh-oh.
64935,Marge,"moe, do these guys think you're one of them?"
63463,Marge,forget it! one day a week i should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
62253,Marge,"aw honey, please take this seriously. when people used to ask me how you were doing, i said ""at least he's got his health."" now you've got nothing! nothing! for me, please try a healthy vegetable."
63565,Marge,dwight? are you okay?! dwight!
60321,Marge,who is this?
62870,Marge,"mr. simpson, i don't even know you -- i'm not making love with you!"
55331,Marge,that's not my voice!
56395,Marge,"hey, the bartender even looks like john travolta."
67448,Marge,"well, how did he say it?"
64263,Marge,"oh homie, you were brilliant. i knew you could do it. i knew it..."
66876,Marge,"well, to raise money, we're... putting on a revue."
66230,Marge,quit talking about that baby!
64917,Marge,you wanna stay up and talk a while? i'm not sleepy.
55713,Marge,it's not batman!
58778,Marge,g'night.
64059,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe what you doodily-did for us."
61874,Marge,that's how we got our kaypro!
67322,Marge,"okay, but watch out. don't slam my head like last time."
66353,Marge,"homer, quit badgering the boy."
58150,Marge,there's no shame in being a pariah.
58942,Marge,"ohhh, it's heavenly! ""why do birds suddenly appear... over there, over here..."""
66386,Marge,"well, that's one of them!"
62714,Marge,sorry i asked.
65876,Marge,"homer, that's you."
61736,Marge,"now, that wasn't so bad, was it bart? you know, sometimes the fear of some..."
64144,Marge,"homer, that's you!"
60462,Marge,hello?
62706,Marge,maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
59281,Marge,"i think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
56586,Marge,"okay, tv off. it's family time."
60292,Marge,i never agreed to that rule!
56308,Marge,that's not true. romance is all around us. in our neighborhoods...
61504,Marge,but she's only eight!
67041,Marge,"lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and i'll draw you a nice hot bath? that helps me when i feel sad."
59350,Marge,molokai?!
66363,Marge,"i have to get to the church. helen lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer signup sheet. in five minutes, every good task will be taken! dang it!"
65592,Marge,okay.
64116,Marge,"but then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever."
61163,Marge,what?!
64329,Marge,okey-doke.
55543,Marge,oooh! they're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
66638,Marge,good baby.
58530,Marge,he's up in his room. bart?
65785,Marge,"homie, i just had a horrible thought."
59914,Marge,"don't be selfish, lisa."
62931,Marge,homer? homer? now we have to kiss. the big tv is telling us to!
55505,Marge,whoa!
57555,Marge,"hello, helen."
65983,Marge,what did he do in the future?
59461,Marge,wait! how do you know this is where lincoln buried the gold? you just started counting from an arbitrary place.
64974,Marge,i'm looking for homer simpson.
60801,Marge,"yes they did, look closer."
60415,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad to see... a tape on the bed?!"
63040,Marge,"homer, i was pretty upset with you, but in the end, i... i... i-beam!"
58886,Marge,homer...
60238,Marge,"honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
63001,Marge,"if we can't find a home for those animals, they'll be put to sleep. your sister's very upset."
61651,Marge,it's their hub.
56200,Marge,what's going on in there?
57295,Marge,"girls, lisa. boys kiss girls."
58052,Marge,"you know, homer, i'm starting to realize life is short."
64639,Marge,homer? i'm-- you!
62096,Marge,"thank you, mr. simpson."
54735,Marge,"hmmm. thank you. i will, dr. hibbert. thanks for coming."
61155,Marge,oh my god. it's so beautiful.
65767,Marge,"homer! dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!"
54614,Marge,why don't we put on some music?
59029,Marge,now there's the place you want to buy your buttons.
54663,Marge,i know who i'm in love with.
54617,Marge,could he be singing about me?
55274,Marge,where were you all night?
63527,Marge,"homer, you cannot miss lisa's big day. and you have to come sober!"
67912,Marge,"yo! i'm the coolest puppet in sockville, and i love strained spinach!"
63017,Marge,"i did it! what's that strange feeling? it's ""of accomplishment""!"
66857,Marge,fine. there's meatloaf...
66268,Marge,why did i do this for money? why did i do this for money?
67491,Marge,"lisa, i'm very sorry about what happened."
59839,Marge,what's wrong with my sundaes?
61328,Marge,"homie, i'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined! you're even covering your mouth when you burp."
65263,Marge,we tried that last year!
56270,Marge,who could that be...?
64744,Marge,no it's not!
67568,Marge,no! you're ruining the show. oh... oh... oh. stop.
58191,Marge,it was wearing a hat!
66835,Marge,"homer, i want to say something extremely important the way a woman does: subtly through someone else. kids?"
60640,Marge,it's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
59670,Marge,we can't go on fighting with olde springfield. these people are our neighbors. we see them every day.
56016,Marge,please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
56766,Marge,"and bart isn't doing very well either. he needs boundaries, and structure. there's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome."
61823,Marge,i stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust.
55764,Marge,"bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!"
65978,Marge,"well, dumbo had a magic feather. he thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time."
59858,Marge,stop that! and get ready! we're going to the old folks' talent show. now get washed up.
62313,Marge,"well, homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?"
59282,Marge,stop that! if you want some food i'll be happy to make you some breakfast.
55300,Marge,homer?
58507,Marge,they're terrible.
67688,Marge,i'm a political prisoner. last time i ever take a stand.
64494,Marge,my favorite subject. i'll go first. isn't he cute?
60748,Marge,what on earth have you done? my mcguppies became bazongas!
62400,Marge,"lisa, honey. i know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore!"
56880,Marge,"when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. after that, she never forgot him."
67863,Marge,"oh, lisa, this was a bad idea."
56510,Marge,"homeie, i can't quite..."
66115,Marge,find love on the net
62094,Marge,"okay, don't do it for her--"
60408,Marge,"hello, artie."
60825,Marge,you have to do something to protect my husband.
65462,Marge,"bart, glad you're here. we're all gonna watch a movie together."
67676,Marge,pick one.
66193,Marge,that's not helping.
55593,Marge,"well, i have some tic tacs in my purse..."
62483,Marge,i was asking for something.
56022,Marge,i can name ten things! i... i made sloppy joes...
58782,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
63841,Marge,me? a professional baker's employee? imagine how different my life would be!
65535,Marge,"no! for details, log onto thesimpsons.com."
65729,Marge,good boy.
56152,Marge,bowling ball... more underpants...
57008,Marge,what?!
56562,Marge,daddy?
61529,Marge,"oh my. well, homer, maybe you should take him to moe's."
60987,Marge,hold your horses. i was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
65703,Marge,oh homie. i'm so sorry.
63068,Marge,"hustle your bustles, gang! we're going to the senior olympics to root for grampa!"
61784,Marge,"relax, we're just looky-loos. we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
55904,Marge,"homer, this is serious."
59233,Marge,i can't get maggie to eat. maybe if you try...
61349,Marge,i'll cut to the chase. i brought with me the very best reason i can think of for what i believe in.
57937,Marge,"homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. what if they start a war?"
58096,Marge,"well, i can too compete. and i'm going to sell a house. end of story."
67312,Marge,like an angel.
63670,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
63051,Marge,cylinders?!
61946,Marge,no harm done.
58726,Marge,i can't believe it passed.
60481,Marge,bill.
63309,Marge,i better check on my elf-self!
66121,Marge,hello! where's homer?
62719,Marge,"she's kissing his boo-boo! that's it, i'm going in."
57922,Marge,"yeeesss. well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
61316,Marge,what a mall!
63454,Marge,it's marge simpson. i need you to coach like you've never coached before.
59079,Marge,be careful. we need that money to get home.
56563,Marge,my father was a stewardess.
62863,Marge,i remember bart!
59410,Marge,"okay, lisa. i've got furious d across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down."
57228,Marge,no. the b-u-m.
66746,Marge,"i never thought i'd say this to someone i cared for, much less my husband, but i'm saying it now: i don't want you here on christmas."
67460,Marge,"well, i'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament."
58017,Marge,"wow, homer coaching in the championship game. you must be pretty proud of your son."
63085,Marge,"i just wish i could do something to be remembered by... something that says ""marge was here!"" after i'm gone."
60608,Marge,"well, your father ate it all."
57237,Marge,sounds like you're really falling for him.
62151,Marge,"captain, wait! i have something here that might change your mind!"
65975,Marge,moe? what are you doing?
63964,Marge,homie... i'm not sure about this new business of yours. you're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
59863,Marge,even bonnets?
57998,Marge,i'm talking about treating serious injuries.
66615,Marge,i'm not sure this is going to work out.
65491,Marge,homer!
65813,Marge,"homer, a little help?"
57289,Marge,"am i cool, kids?"
66272,Marge,i've opened up my house to you. and all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
67101,Marge,"homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to."
57781,Marge,"well, i think volunteering is great. deep down it makes you feel --"
54666,Marge,"whatever you say, little boy."
59902,Marge,"well, i think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
64037,Marge,oh really?
56509,Marge,sane planning: sensible tomorrow.
61868,Marge,fine! i'll take my mothering elsewhere.
55680,Marge,"oh homie, i could never remarry..."
63429,Marge,"oh hi, kids. you're just in time to go to the dentist!"
56671,Marge,"i'm sorry. all we have is nescafe. i'm very, very sorry."
66149,Marge,really? how?
64684,Marge,i didn't see you come in.
64562,Marge,you mean... he kissed her?
55362,Marge,can't complain.
62727,Marge,that's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
55320,Marge,my little guy's first rock concert. i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud.
61940,Marge,don't worry. we've got two hours before it burns down to my head.
58941,Marge,"lisa, no, no, don't! it won't be the--"
55756,Marge,i think we should go.
66821,Marge,our kids just did something amazing!
63005,Marge,ooh! a j.c. penney's...used to be here.
62471,Marge,"oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
56775,Marge,i hate it when he gets in there.
57729,Marge,"wait! wait! you can't do this! all my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. now, i'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. our freedom to drink."
59738,Marge,ohhhh.
55740,Marge,it deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter rabbinical school.
56158,Marge,stop remembering tv and get back to work.
61475,Marge,kids?
56807,Marge,death sports.
67923,Marge,"homer, i don't know you. my wife and your wife are friends. we met just three hours ago."
64708,Marge,no time! i don't wanna get stuck behind the joggers from the fat camp.
63343,Marge,i'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
62577,Marge,you're not joking. any other surprises?
67885,Marge,"mr. burns, i've had enough of your... posing. i can finish the portrait myself."
66711,Marge,i want so much to believe you.
65317,Marge,"it seemed a little... ""ripe"", so i brought it home to clean it for you."
66897,Marge,"maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. and i'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, i'll get my husband back."
66793,Marge,"well, i guess it'll have to be in bart's room. and i thought when homer cut off his thumb was bad."
65693,Marge,hurry up! i want to get grampa back here by three so we can get him and maggie on the same nap schedule.
57263,Marge,"hmmm... maybe it needs a little mayonnaise to get going. okay, you go sit in the sun and let it melt in."
64643,Marge,this is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. you'll have a good time. i invited a friend for you.
55878,Marge,what kind of slime would i marry? i don't understand.
59406,Marge,i wonder what would happen if they had a baby?
64874,Marge,i'm trying! it just keeps popping off.
62230,Marge,"homer, how did you think i'd feel when i saw that?"
64171,Marge,"homer simpson, you are a strong finisher."
66066,Marge,"homie, i bet you're wondering why i stayed on the computer until four a.m."
61684,Marge,"get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
67429,Marge,"now, homer."
56937,Marge,"well, look at the other side."
64357,Marge,i could do worse...
61089,Marge,"that was a delicious meal, cookie. what do we do with our garbage?"
61477,Marge,"listen, mr. hobo. you may not have laundry to wash, but i do. now what do you want to show me?"
55722,Marge,"wait a minute. that was ""prince of tides."""
65145,Marge,shhh. don't say a word.
58922,Marge,wish you were her. how many of these is he going to send me?
59710,Marge,"homie, where did you get that ball of money?"
55988,Marge,what was it you wanted to show me?
67936,Marge,how did you get in my game? are you a virus?
58750,Marge,no he's not.
67492,Marge,"i've noticed that, too. well, when you feel like coming down, we'll be there."
57792,Marge,"well, ned, you don't have to stand for that. you just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
66975,Marge,"don't be nervous. we believe in you, homer."
59604,Marge,i'm not insane!
67764,Marge,patty! selma! we're home.
65811,Marge,"fine, no tv for twenty-four hours."
55303,Marge,"now kids, i know you're all excited about meeting aunt selma's new boyfriend tonight."
56657,Marge,he wants to talk to you.
60964,Marge,i don't think this is a good place for a ten-year-old boy.
55271,Marge,"oh, shut up, homer! no one wants to hear what you think!"
60262,Marge,we don't need tv to have family fun. why don't we play monopoly?
65512,Marge,it's angry.
61164,Marge,"kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. we're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
57588,Marge,"homer, did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
55738,Marge,do you feel any better?
59199,Marge,i'm afraid so. and his wife's with him.
66165,Marge,just put on the kiss record.
60639,Marge,how can you have such an appetite at a time like this?
56279,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time."
66238,Marge,"they are, huh?"
59906,Marge,"okay, everybody. say ""funny."""
63647,Marge,"here's a message for you: ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop!"
58869,Marge,"no, your father drives like an old lady."
60623,Marge,"darn her socks?... i say, darn her! i'll do them and then i'm outta here."
58155,Marge,stop this madness. it's just a washcloth.
64761,Marge,"homie, help him up!"
64570,Marge,but we insist on paying our own way.
54701,Marge,i should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
63859,Marge,"homie, what do you say we go to bed? you, me and the cake?"
60518,Marge,how come you talked for four hundred dollars?
57418,Marge,no. it's a house of ill fame... a house of loose ethics...
66102,Marge,i have three kids.
66281,Marge,"oh, the happy sound of a blender."
65382,Marge,i can see how this show might not be to his liking.
66179,Marge,"you've had the same job, same car, same house for twenty years. and that's all you'll ever have. a cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change. and you're okay with it!"
62377,Marge,"aw, you're a good thing. i know it. let me clean out your ears."
55947,Marge,"read the back, the back."
56049,Marge,"hi, hober. dote kiss be, i'b all stuffed up."
60943,Marge,it's reverend lovejoy!
55184,Marge,"actually, homer, you brought up ned flanders. i never said a word --"
62981,Marge,"homer, helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. could you pick it up?"
65073,Marge,"goomar?! that's mob talk for ""mistress."" fat tony has a mistress!"
58605,Marge,it won't go any --
57029,Marge,five tires?! am i seeing things?
58858,Marge,"geez! try the gas pedal, gramma. it's right there, next to the brake. oh, forgodssa-- go back to new jersey..."
63409,Marge,here's five more dollars.
65568,Marge,and what's that smell?
66477,Marge,"homie, i don't have a problem with you. except your buttons are off one.... actually, this is a collar button... see? it goes like this..."
63585,Marge,"great. now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then?"
63707,Marge,stop it! stop it!
55582,Marge,"well, i guess that's it. people like us can't afford justice. come on homie, let's go before he fires you too."
65092,Marge,"okay. okay, the spare key is somewhere in here."
61601,Marge,but he won't know where to go or what to eat.
62292,Marge,just as you predicted.
55807,Marge,"oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
56091,Marge,"i don't think the guns are a good idea, homer."
67581,Marge,well... what's the problem you're having?
63581,Marge,i get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
59295,Marge,"no, you don't have to kill anyone. not if you have jobs."
57173,Marge,"lisa, please!!"
57099,Marge,"oh, bart, not again... give it to me."
61217,Marge,will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
63583,Marge,stop it! that's my favorite couch!
65266,Marge,"why do you say ""future?"" this is now."
62651,Marge,what are you talking about?
62247,Marge,"well until that day, i'm still bart's mother, and i don't like him stuffing himself with junk."
61332,Marge,it's on batteries.
55414,Marge,"stanley, stop or i'll tell stella."
57648,Marge,yes we can!
60810,Marge,this rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
65826,Marge,wondered where that was.
67817,Marge,this one's mine.
66998,Marge,maybe we should move to a larger community.
57438,Marge,"well, i pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. i pictured napkins... homer, i want to throw a dinner party."
60807,Marge,all of you stink so much.
58493,Marge,"well, you're not thomas edison."
56409,Marge,"oh my. lisa, go to your room."
64926,Marge,so bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. can you believe it?
64002,Marge,homer!
57326,Marge,"yes, doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. hugo is loose. see you soon."
54907,Marge,"homer, maybe you better take milhouse home."
66984,Marge,ummm... maybe i will take you up on that punch.
60368,Marge,go around! go around!
60278,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
57758,Marge,"lisa, nobody likes a gloater. right, homie?"
62108,Marge,he's cleaning out the garage. i can picture it now...
62950,Marge,"o-kay... tonight we're gonna discuss little ways to keep your romance alive. make time for each other -- an hour, an evening, a mini-vacation..."
57095,Marge,i didn't think you'd mind. i figured you were getting a little too old for this. but you can still make one. there's some snow left under the car.
57195,Marge,"oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?"
60050,Marge,one more and i get a free hysterectomy.
62005,Marge,"homer, i made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. and besides... i love you. you're my homie-womie-romie-domie..."
66858,Marge,why are you telling me all these things?
61820,Marge,why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?
58649,Marge,let's go! in the pot. in the pot.
62159,Marge,now pull over!
60931,Marge,"homer, we can't sue the church. they'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin."
65471,Marge,just take me home.
55354,Marge,what in god's name are you talking about?
61019,Marge,those jets keep going lower and lower.
60349,Marge,a formal. the one place you can wear a tiara and not look crazy.
54779,Marge,"but the big day finally came. and because i'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
60547,Marge,what's that billowing down the stairs? it's smoke!
56389,Marge,"it's cute, but i'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
60293,Marge,"ow, my hairstyle!"
58815,Marge,the only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
54974,Marge,this is from the national fatherhood institute. it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
58915,Marge,but what if he chokes?
59991,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? he named it after his wife."
60946,Marge,you've gotta get rid of those furbies. they've turned feral!
58480,Marge,lisa...
64777,Marge,dear god. we just killed a man.
63512,Marge,i don't want to live like that.
61653,Marge,"honeymooners -- no kids, no worries."
67184,Marge,"what, homer?"
56183,Marge,"c'mon, honey."
66202,Marge,fine. you can have your old one!
60152,Marge,"homer, no!"
59769,Marge,"oh, stop. your father and i don't get the day off."
59643,Marge,"why don't you read ""cathy""? she's hilarious."
61600,Marge,"now sweetie, you shouldn't hang around with people who beat you. they're not true friends."
60034,Marge,bart!!!
63674,Marge,"because i didn't want him finding out about the party. i mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring sarah, and i just don't care for that woman."
66769,Marge,i don't like the end sounds on that.
58564,Marge,sorry. i didn't realize i was in the way.
67751,Marge,"but homer, i'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home."
65914,Marge,mmm... new cushion smell!
63246,Marge,you redid the basement!
60078,Marge,uh... hello.
66252,Marge,"bart, don't use language like that!"
56094,Marge,"bart, i've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune."
62203,Marge,"that teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!"
56321,Marge,hmmm.
65515,Marge,"...and that's how berber carpet got its name, according to some. lisa, how was your day?"
57578,Marge,"dinner's in the oven. if you want some butter, it's under my face."
66023,Marge,"thank you, god."
63652,Marge,"oh, lighten up. you tv fat cats have plenty of money. my cousin maureen saw you flying in business class!"
64080,Marge,"goodnight, bart."
59977,Marge,"homie, did you remember to tip kitenge?"
62384,Marge,"homie, i accept your apology."
63860,Marge,"don't feel too bad, homie. you'll be free tomorrow. and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me."
64411,Marge,bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
62827,Marge,"um... i-i think a woman came up with nylon stockings. i mean, probably. we certainly use them."
57950,Marge,"let's come to our senses, everyone. this witch hunt is turning into a circus."
55925,Marge,i don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
62617,Marge,"they can't charge me for something i use every day. what's next, a spatula tax?"
55958,Marge,"i'd like to pledge thirty dollars. oh, thank you!"
62171,Marge,"there must be something else. think marge, think. culture... vulture... birds of prey... pray in a church... the father, son and holy ghost... ghosts are scary, scary rhymes with gehry! that's it -- architect frank gehry! he could build us a concert hall like he did in los angeles."
62920,Marge,"homer, please."
63458,Marge,we left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
61020,Marge,"krusty, we're desperate here. we need you to turn your campaign around."
58383,Marge,oh my goodness gracious!
55509,Marge,"homer, get back here."
63866,Marge,bart simpson's stolen cell phone -- can i help you?
65636,Marge,"lisa, dinnertime!"
56895,Marge,"were you talking to me, grampa?"
65791,Marge,"on main street, turn right now... / our sunday drive is ruined! hands at ten and two!"
62822,Marge,they're coming down the aisles! what if they want to interact with me!?
64702,Marge,"well, you could get some ice cream, or...spend a week at performing arts camp!"
58646,Marge,"ooh, so plump and juicy. he's gonna boil up nicely."
62746,Marge,that's funny.
67272,Marge,"everyone here in the united states is fine. we think maggie may say her first word any day now. lisa got an a in math, which i'm only mentioning as news -- i'm not putting you down. and your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you."
64378,Marge,homie?
65012,Marge,"all of j.d. salinger's books, except ""catcher in the rye!"" used pizza protectors!"
63514,Marge,maggie's completely independent.
56393,Marge,yuh-huh. i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. are you kids gonna be alright?
57291,Marge,"well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried everything here."
62784,Marge,and i don't know who's more handsome: the bull taunter or the bull stabber.
59885,Marge,"oh, homey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings."
66040,Marge,just read the saga and see what it says.
63915,Marge,i don't like the look of those air quotes.
56757,Marge,"she's right, homer. there's something about his face i don't trust."
56694,Marge,"it's supposed to say jay's name, not yours."
67303,Marge,yeah.
58216,Marge,i've never heard of these movementarians. are they some kind of church?
56235,Marge,"... there's that. or, you could take an adult education course."
56985,Marge,"bart, no!"
64956,Marge,"what do you think, homie?"
59074,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
55101,Marge,"homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
62443,Marge,stop eating the oatmeal! that's the third tub you've eaten!
64565,Marge,and it means the world to me.
62554,Marge,have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
67346,Marge,"well, maybe it would help him to be left back. it won't be so bad, bart."
63288,Marge,"six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. wow! and all this time i thought ""googling yourself"" meant the other thing."
57805,Marge,donny!
65965,Marge,"bart, you're in charge of grampa."
63661,Marge,"well, i guess the rest of us should pay our respects."
55268,Marge,maybe we could see something a little more adult.
62097,Marge,"homer, no stop! you're thinking of buckingham palace!"
55190,Marge,"there was more than enough in the swear jar. and if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
59810,Marge,"why, thank you, jack."
62375,Marge,what do i do?
67864,Marge,do you really think so? my high school art teacher hated them.
66796,Marge,homer... you're not going to school.
56205,Marge,"good for you, homie. you know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
55021,Marge,it's homer!
66350,Marge,dr. hibbert.
56289,Marge,"believe me, honey. she's more scared of you than you are of her."
61509,Marge,lisa... lisa...
60208,Marge,maybe.
57522,Marge,...and you're from mars.
65313,Marge,homer! watch the road!
59768,Marge,"it's hauntingly beautiful, isn't it?"
63415,Marge,watering can!
62450,Marge,get out of this house!
64796,Marge,everything's just the way i remember it...
59825,Marge,"oh, my goodness!"
66800,Marge,they've run away!
65731,Marge,everything's normal. the world didn't end.
54856,Marge,i think it means he's having a barbecue.
57332,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. the waffle iron's in the shop."
65679,Marge,"i'd love to, but maggie's a little shy..."
57309,Marge,so where do you want to show off your new hip togs? the sherbet shoppe? the candle district? big sue's tap water taffy?
55591,Marge,and this is for the man of the house... which i guess... is you.
65802,Marge,i threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
64766,Marge,"oh, roger! you really know what you're doing!"
62329,Marge,i guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
59372,Marge,seems a little wasteful.
65321,Marge,no tv on a smart phone!
59630,Marge,"something that swings, with the beat of new orleans."
63257,Marge,"be nice, homer. don't you see how great it is that they found each other? like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog."
62944,Marge,"uh, i-i think what homer means is, why don't you tell us what each of you feels is the problem."
60384,Marge,"artie. artie, no. stop."
59224,Marge,can i interest you in a mincemeat pie? there very...
64871,Marge,what?
62453,Marge,uh-hmm.
65710,Marge,bart and lisa.
66722,Marge,"homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and i got one."
61243,Marge,deal! hit me! hit me! hit me! busted!
66101,Marge,"that is so sweet! there i go again, settling!"
59513,Marge,we'd be much better rock breakers if we weren't all chained together.
56197,Marge,i just think they're neat.
58214,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homer. you got us our house back."
62481,Marge,staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
58304,Marge,mmmaybe he needs some real friends.
57181,Marge,"no, i can't. c'mon, let's go."
60538,Marge,there's nothing to be afraid of. they're all grown by the vegetable division of union carbide.
56163,Marge,"well, they will."
67805,Marge,"hello, doctor hibbert? this is marge simpson."
65887,Marge,this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! it got three-and-a-half stars in the springfield tire guide!
55176,Marge,i think he needs a dog house.
54646,Marge,i thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
67645,Marge,"your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, homer."
62130,Marge,"last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
57320,Marge,kids! stop that! don't make me get the carney!
67502,Marge,"no, no, no! that won't do at all!"
67050,Marge,"you do love her, don't you?"
59430,Marge,missionary work?
64396,Marge,"oh, nothing fancy..."
61996,Marge,"moe, your upper lip is trembling."
57220,Marge,except...
67691,Marge,"well thank you, artie."
59784,Marge,"sorry, homie, but you promised to take me to the apron expo today."
61574,Marge,"my drinking problem is out of control. at oktoberfest, all i could think about was beer! i couldn't even celebrate... the harvest."
59257,Marge,"apu, come quick! you're missing the miracle!"
57478,Marge,"when i first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. but i worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
56832,Marge,"so, how are you, mrs. krabappel?"
61124,Marge,"well, it's eleven a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar."
66093,Marge,the dowager grandmum!
60064,Marge,"ohhh, thank you."
56166,Marge,i really think this is a bad idea.
64982,Marge,"bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! let's get this yo on the road, people!"
67341,Marge,"yes, dear?"
64485,Marge,the realest thing i've ever done.
55491,Marge,my name is marge bouvier. i'm here about your ad.
57310,Marge,oh... okay.
59232,Marge,"num num, maggie. num num."
63606,Marge,then go to moe's!
58310,Marge,"bart, you don't have to go anywhere today. i've got a surprise for you."
56962,Marge,"bart, sensible bites! all right lisa. if you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things i can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs..."
57013,Marge,"uh, excuse me, sir, i think there's been a mistake."
58264,Marge,"ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt."
55812,Marge,arrrgh!
65640,Marge,"water's coming in the house, and we've got carpet mushrooms!"
57831,Marge,i know. and i made your favorite --
58802,Marge,eighteen hours? nobody works that hard.
62834,Marge,i don't know. i'm still frowny with you. do you really think women are mentally inferior?
61733,Marge,who's ready for a kitten?
59714,Marge,"are you kidding? there's funky winkerbean! over here, funky! look, it's the noid! avoid the noid! he ruins pizzas!"
57598,Marge,"okay, but when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in."
58848,Marge,of course not!
66860,Marge,homer simpson. working with those plants is great! it's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
64912,Marge,"go out on a tuesday? who am i, charlie sheen?"
55461,Marge,"no, it's nothing bad. i'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
62933,Marge,"give me a kiss, homie."
63468,Marge,"oh my god! oh my god! quick, everyone put on their long faces!"
61903,Marge,"the excitement never stops. chloe, would you like to see slides of our trip to athens... boulevard recreational center?"
58824,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet."
64694,Marge,in the mood for another round?
66513,Marge,marge simpson. congratulations on little king george.
62832,Marge,he's one of bart's friends.
64525,Marge,"ooo, a hundred and three! no school today."
60330,Marge,mm. i guess you just can't use the law to nag. maybe i should just stop trying to change the world.
67266,Marge,homer!
57993,Marge,"oh, homie."
57899,Marge,coming out of my eight-track...
59545,Marge,"yes, our tiny tapper. what was it you were going to say after ""i wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
62393,Marge,"well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. what ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
55754,Marge,"the point is, i want you to stop making these calls."
67084,Marge,"i don't understand. what's this all about? well, i suppose pork chops are his favorite."
60948,Marge,don't go telling your buddies at work about this.
56715,Marge,oh really? did you see the loom? i took loom in high school.
58474,Marge,all you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? don't you need a notebook or something?
54999,Marge,"we'll have a savings account. we've never had one. kids, i think everything is going to be okay from now on."
57331,Marge,lisa! breakfast! we're having waffles!
58011,Marge,how can you treat him that way? don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
54944,Marge,you sound like you're going to buy a pony. promise me you won't.
62036,Marge,"well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk."
62072,Marge,the toilet seat's up!
56462,Marge,"hm, i better go check that out. now homer, don't you eat this pie."
67822,Marge,i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
56871,Marge,"where you going, bart?"
65823,Marge,read the rest of the title!
54728,Marge,"homer, please. we've never thrown a party. now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
58562,Marge,run for it.
57145,Marge,"alright, i will buy it. it'll be good for the economy."
61137,Marge,when will they stop?
62229,Marge,"i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable ray! who, by the way, i've never even met!"
57894,Marge,because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies.
65138,Marge,come in and get some more!
55600,Marge,"homer, bart's at a very curious age. as his father, i think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
65225,Marge,i hope bart's having fun.
54875,Marge,"homer, i want you to go down to that club and talk to them. just see what kind of people they are. please, homie?"
62975,Marge,flowers every week! i wish i was dead.
61851,Marge,"for our first game, i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower."
65101,Marge,homer? could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are?
64175,Marge,"jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
57785,Marge,"oh. well, it's time to start telling the truth. now, when i have to tell my husband the truth, i cook him a big delicious dinner. by the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what i have to say."
58143,Marge,"also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
62716,Marge,"ned, are you checking up on me?"
64602,Marge,i hope dylan likes trucks.
56470,Marge,"homer, we can't root for one child over the other. you wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us."
59154,Marge,my sweet baby. he must feel so helpless and scared.
64202,Marge,janey.
64053,Marge,that number's so big it has a comma!
60702,Marge,that explains that.
64101,Marge,"wait a minute, who am i pleading with?"
56492,Marge,homer.
63594,Marge,there's a bee on maggie!
57378,Marge,"i can't excape lisa, our little walking libary!"
55398,Marge,well... i thought i told you..
59840,Marge,"oh, don't fight. all great art is controversial at first. but years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""that's a jack crowley."""
60351,Marge,"mm, thank you."
55152,Marge,no. i mean a vacation by myself.
58883,Marge,"come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair."
61033,Marge,i didn't know mr. burns had an electric eel pond.
62123,Marge,"well, i just think we should be building a nest egg."
58582,Marge,"oh, that's your cure for everything."
56301,Marge,it's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool.
55681,Marge,"ohhh... kids, you can come in now."
66824,Marge,that's not a healthy way to lose weight.
57177,Marge,"mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
55446,Marge,"no, homer, you got it just right."
59502,Marge,did you really have to handcuff the children?
55055,Marge,i don't know. i heard radiation can make you sterile.
66997,Marge,"but homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the man upstairs?"
62287,Marge,"homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. and you're reading books! word books! what's going on?"
61139,Marge,"hey, i'd like that. i can't. i have to go pick up grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station."
66263,Marge,what would baby jesus do?
66245,Marge,"either way for forty-five minutes you're not my problem, sweetie."
60113,Marge,that's not good for the clock.
63689,Marge,there is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about. a turbulent part.
61418,Marge,"i'm finished! and it's so suggestive. but like they say, ""snuggling sells."" now, do i dare push ""print?"""
62089,Marge,"selma, i never realized you wanted a child so badly."
62638,Marge,upward bound: the toughest behavioral modification camp in northwest oregon.
59147,Marge,and their beams.
65448,Marge,homer!
59129,Marge,"good morning, honey. how's my special little guy?"
54642,Marge,when is it due?
63252,Marge,grampa's driving me crazy!
57580,Marge,are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
62212,Marge,i'll tell you what it means when it's over.
55590,Marge,you could see our house in that photo.
56066,Marge,i'll catch up to you.
55369,Marge,that's a very clever idea!
58437,Marge,safe at last.
57017,Marge,she's nice.
55258,Marge,"homie, did you close the gate?"
58793,Marge,annnd... now.
56291,Marge,homer?
66069,Marge,he's writing me again! better put a stop to this.
67273,Marge,remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can to your adopted parents.
58334,Marge,"homer, i painted that for you."
57445,Marge,homer?!
56173,Marge,this is just what happened at the caramel factory.
58885,Marge,you agreed to spend one saturday a month doing something with the kids.
67926,Marge,because i'm a ghost!
61743,Marge,"if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, i do hate americans!"
55734,Marge,are you going to eat it?
54800,Marge,bart does.
57282,Marge,of course you have a choice.
63708,Marge,"honey, this is how i save money on ketchup and mustard."
63399,Marge,i saw it first! / you are such a liar!
56412,Marge,"homer, we've got to stop them."
59976,Marge,ohhhhhhhhh.
54640,Marge,but homer's so supportive. he's paying for me to go to college.
61990,Marge,"howdy, partner! why don't you sit next to us?"
64490,Marge,you love your son. how can you be so hard on him?
61995,Marge,"me too, moe. what a nice surprise that we've become friends."
62621,Marge,they blocked my shortcut!
56593,Marge,i don't know if it's such a good idea. can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
62057,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so proud of you. you stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
55308,Marge,bart!
60427,Marge,we can't take his money.
60136,Marge,haven't we been humiliated enough?
56769,Marge,"well, i'm sure some of you already know me. i'm bart simpson's mother."
62993,Marge,is it in a safe neighborhood?
57471,Marge,"i will. oh homie, of course i will."
67763,Marge,well if you have other plans...
58882,Marge,"c'mon, move your butt! you're blocking traffic!"
66825,Marge,you don't have to do this alone.
55755,Marge,"lisa, the only way you'll lick this is one day at a time. if you can make it till midnight without calling the corey line, you'll know you've beaten it forever."
64967,Marge,why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and homer? our marriage is rock solid!
64620,Marge,"lisa, sweetheart -- it's almost dinnertime. why don't you come home?"
60309,Marge,"there was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
65926,Marge,d.
67560,Marge,"hmmm, sure. oh, dear. i can't. i've got three protest rallies tomorrow."
54709,Marge,where is he?! where is he?!
60828,Marge,i don't think this was a great place to bring the children.
57968,Marge,"homer, we need something to protect this family."
67389,Marge,don't talk to her like that.
65923,Marge,"not because of what you bought, but because i realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. and there's nothing a woman loves more than that."
61904,Marge,i guess.
60150,Marge,"shh. no, we can't play now."
62526,Marge,uh-huh. and how will this affect your job at the power plant?
60161,Marge,"aw, i'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
66705,Marge,"well, anyway bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend."
60839,Marge,"hey, they have latin grammys."
63508,Marge,i guess it's time to let my little girl grow up.
57140,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. can it be real chanel?"
56410,Marge,"this sounds awfully controversial. lisa, you know i don't like controversy in this house."
62606,Marge,that's sideshow bob!
58756,Marge,you changed your name without consulting me?
60630,Marge,"oh dear, now everyone will think homer and i did it. the real killer is the man with the braces."
61742,Marge,"well, america's not perfect--"
59584,Marge,dead in a week? what are you talking about?
67315,Marge,"thank you for coming on such short notice, ms. botz."
64751,Marge,"actually, i'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
56553,Marge,"no, i didn't."
57171,Marge,"i really need to concentrate on this, lisa, would you mind--"
63537,Marge,"okay. i'll visit you, dwight."
67128,Marge,"but this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special."
64781,Marge,we killed an innocent man. we're murderers! murderers!
59273,Marge,"okay, daddy-o."
57527,Marge,we did it!
64674,Marge,"walt, it's a nice face, but i don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie."
64196,Marge,"feeling better, super dad?"
55272,Marge,"homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. homer?..."
63533,Marge,homer! i'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
62823,Marge,"looking through my purse, looking through my purse... keep walking, monkey!"
62425,Marge,that's not what you do with a hymnal. homer!
66178,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is."
62520,Marge,you... invited me... to your treehouse? wow -- that's like bruce wayne letting his mother into the bat-club.
61320,Marge,you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
61107,Marge,"pointy, pointy, spiky, stylish... where's baldy?!"
61129,Marge,why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
55063,Marge,my husband by my side.
59917,Marge,nobody's going home. we're going to see bart's concert.
59215,Marge,is that plutonium on your gums?
62940,Marge,"homie, i don't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others."
63882,Marge,"oh my god, he's out of frame! zoom out! zoom out!"
66075,Marge,there you go. good as new.
55080,Marge,yes!
62015,Marge,i agree. hey! aren't you that crazy cat lady?
67175,Marge,umm-hmm. but i think i'll do much better tomorrow night.
65388,Marge,he's a baby with wings!
54782,Marge,i don't think so.
66455,Marge,um... deixar meu marido sozinho!
59622,Marge,"okay, the material was a little corny, but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen."
63762,Marge,so that's it. she's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
59680,Marge,mmmm.
59998,Marge,very nice.
61432,Marge,hello?
55319,Marge,"well, he fooled almost everyone. but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
59131,Marge,bart! get those oranges out of there.
58518,Marge,"oh, i've never been so proud. you both deserve a big, big reward!"
64837,Marge,what's all that noise?
62284,Marge,"here's a pretty little wig for lisa, and a handsome toupee for bart!"
64907,Marge,"seven years. a lot of memories. talking, chatting..."
60701,Marge,but you did have violent diarrhea. nobody open the hallway closet until i say it's okay.
59132,Marge,back in the lunches you go.
59100,Marge,is mel gibson here?
64283,Marge,what was that?!
64252,Marge,i think mel would be happier as an understudy. a six-feet-understudy.
66451,Marge,"""selecionar conta..."" ooh, ""select account""!"
58634,Marge,"oh, homie, you made breakfast."
65369,Marge,what are you doing here?
65538,Marge,quit bageling my english muffins!
66918,Marge,homer?
61858,Marge,"well, i guess it's just you and me, bart!"
57884,Marge,"not to us you're not. i mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor?"
63397,Marge,i've only got twenty-seven minutes! the pre-heat is on!
60180,Marge,absolutely. you're about to get a lesson... in value!
60094,Marge,"all right, but i'm doing this because he was remington steele. he was remington steele, wasn't he?"
66849,Marge,so you're a taxi?
67574,Marge,excuse me. excuse me. he was addressing me.
61562,Marge,i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
63564,Marge,"dwight, do something!"
63681,Marge,"that's what you said about yellow fever, and that was no fun."
66710,Marge,my biggest sin is that i dare to hope.
67516,Marge,"oh, my little boy, ."
57872,Marge,"no. no lisa, they're just... sleeping. upside down. and inside out."
54654,Marge,there's no time! i need you for the wedding toast!
63732,Marge,"a ballet academy here in springfield?! move over, europe!"
64141,Marge,dim the lights.
62579,Marge,"when i joined, i never thought we'd be robbing people."
58219,Marge,you what?!
63617,Marge,"ooh, l.a.! this could be the gym for me."
63907,Marge,no more non-dice board games.
67620,Marge,"yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother. he's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
62106,Marge,"hey, hey, it's krusty the clown! what do you say, krusty?"
62872,Marge,why can i remember everyone in town except my husband?
67339,Marge,oh! the little tiger tries so hard. why does he keep failing?
65026,Marge,and i wouldn't blame him. you destroyed our son's self-esteem.
55817,Marge,why'd you bring that up?
62420,Marge,the cemetery? and you're just sitting here?
67305,Marge,"i love you, too."
67566,Marge,violence-in children's-program-ming.
58907,Marge,you still haven't told us why lenny bit you.
60507,Marge,"ooh, that's the movie phone guy."
62099,Marge,"selma, she's beautiful!"
58346,Marge,no!
66109,Marge,what a wonderful anniversary.
56221,Marge,"bart! homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love?"
66438,Marge,give back the painting! the whole town's turned against us!
60221,Marge,"look, i don't want to start a whole thing with this."
66943,Marge,"oh, homer."
61350,Marge,her name is lisa. and i wouldn't trade her for all the sleep-in sundays and speed dating in the world.
56268,Marge,won't this overload the motor?
66732,Marge,you don't know what a per diem is.
63505,Marge,i'm what?!
55050,Marge,"well, you may not look like ted bessell, but you're just as nice."
64354,Marge,"eh, well..."
65863,Marge,"oh, that was so sweet."
64487,Marge,"what's up, seymour?"
60402,Marge,"no way, no how! i'll get used to the snoring, just like i got used to saying ""courtney cox-arquette""."
64389,Marge,ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-...
57087,Marge,i don't know. why don't you go to bed?
66351,Marge,don't take too long!
55324,Marge,we'll discuss it later. is milhouse okay?
62074,Marge,she's a man! looks like patty's gonna get something she didn't register for.
55182,Marge,"although actually there's only one. and it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
56753,Marge,"now i know we love the puppies very much, but i think they're getting to be a problem."
55838,Marge,homer!
63254,Marge,i invited selma here to watch grampa watch the kids.
61802,Marge,and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen?
61035,Marge,so my husband goes to a bar every night. whoop de doo. who gives a bibble? gabba gabba hey!
55919,Marge,"an ""a plus""! how did you do it?"
63230,Marge,"mr. burns, we're so sorry. the plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, mr. smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock."
57878,Marge,i hope your father had as much fun as we did.
55070,Marge,"homer, do you know why i married you?"
56347,Marge,it all started on an outing for dinner...
55931,Marge,well why can't i be greedy once in awhile?
66441,Marge,see what your greed has done?
59196,Marge,homer...
59536,Marge,"all right. i'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, vicki."
61296,Marge,"well, i'm proud of you, homie."
57919,Marge,"come on, honey. i guess this is a world you'll never know."
62321,Marge,"bart, i'm glad you had fun, but i wouldn't get too into that catholic church. with all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like simon says without a winner!"
60390,Marge,"you can't use the word ""sex"" on the internet."
66010,Marge,i'd like to go home now. and to think you'd do this on mother's day.
66452,Marge,i did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so i could use the english option.
56314,Marge,i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
64230,Marge,without me?
55498,Marge,"oh hi, homie."
61402,Marge,that's it. a novel about whaling -- that's something you haven't seen before. thank you...
66823,Marge,"i'm sorry but i can't. i'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two presidents were fatter than you, and..."
60377,Marge,i haven't lost so much sleep since little barty had the scoots.
67441,Marge,you'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
61400,Marge,hmm... what should i write about?
64011,Marge,"oh hiya, martin! how's the model u.n.?"
64488,Marge,"homer, while you were imagining what the winter olympics were, seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials!"
66969,Marge,"well, i've been thinking, too. you know, homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, mr. berger promised i could come back to my old job anytime i wanted."
55012,Marge,"i want you to take baths, bart."
57000,Marge,con: you're running the air conditioner non-stop. it's freezing in here.
67884,Marge,"that's wonderful homer, i'm so proud of..."
56670,Marge,"this has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, montreal morn."
62386,Marge,i've found a place where i'm needed.
58074,Marge,a headset telephone?! i thought those only existed in the movies!
63405,Marge,"excuse me, excuse me, i'm in the sale! i'm in the sale!"
57049,Marge,they're all gone. the whole batch.
58385,Marge,now that's just non--
58873,Marge,"outta the way! move it or lose it! get going, you!"
58669,Marge,look who's a little cowgirl!
54923,Marge,please?
65959,Marge,what kind of accident?
61343,Marge,and i'm an american!
58137,Marge,tap the brakes! tap the brakes!
60681,Marge,"homie, i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately."
63728,Marge,what's up?
67020,Marge,"oh, homer... we love you."
60127,Marge,i'm sleeping in the bathtub.
59288,Marge,"hm. well, did you see that picture of me in..."
61144,Marge,"oh, you're really coming along, homie."
57664,Marge,"homer, didn't john seem a little... festive to you?"
61591,Marge,you really mean it?
54812,Marge,"honey, what's done is done. no matter what happens, we'll pull through. we always do."
58973,Marge,i'm serious. you never finished painting the garage.
67589,Marge,so what did you kids do today?
61152,Marge,"that's us in a nutshell. i care so much about you, homer, but i'm not even on your list. excuse me."
67097,Marge,homer! were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?
55474,Marge,no! no! i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
61719,Marge,it was years before i could trust a boy again.
55522,Marge,"oh, my poor baby."
57023,Marge,"so, mother simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
61050,Marge,i can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
66848,Marge,"ooh, i didn't know we could decorate our cars."
65475,Marge,just zip it!
57456,Marge,"i must say, luann, you're really handling this splendidly."
65902,Marge,what are you doing home from work?
58616,Marge,"homer, excuse yourself."
61695,Marge,homie... are you the pie man?
59646,Marge,no dessert until you eat your broccoli.
65879,Marge,they sure are getting along.
60192,Marge,you're not going to believe it. that paper towel lumberjack is coming here! for dinner! tonight!
54762,Marge,get back in bed.
55306,Marge,"that's them. now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
60172,Marge,devil beard?
65370,Marge,stop! stop! this is everything we put behind us!
64673,Marge,"excuse me, have you seen this man?"
65415,Marge,there's champagne in those!
55278,Marge,i don't want to. i'm mad at you.
64369,Marge,what's all the hubbub-aloo?
57858,Marge,"sorry, sorry."
55027,Marge,you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song.... it can't be wrong / when it feels so goo/right / cause you -- you
65814,Marge,"instead of watching tv, we can read children's books written by tv stars!"
56384,Marge,homer! we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
60081,Marge,no! goodnight. seesh.
64407,Marge,oh look how the snow glistens on the tiniest branches!
55983,Marge,oh... i've heard a lot about shot kickers.
59142,Marge,is that lisa?
65566,Marge,it says on your facebook page you have no kids.
64792,Marge,"ooo, everything's changed! that tree used to be a smaller tree. and that food bank used to be a regular bank."
59402,Marge,"at least you don't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair. well, except the mop."
60671,Marge,"yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot mr. burns."
67653,Marge,"well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?"
61732,Marge,"how's the ice cream, kids?"
60587,Marge,"homie, it's eleven at night. have you told him yet?"
64520,Marge,"the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil...,the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil,9

64188,Marge,"well, i..."
63625,Marge,"oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day."
59458,Marge,here she is. and look how big she's gotten.
60452,Marge,"well, i think westerns are due for a comeback."
57727,Marge,"you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
63781,Marge,"if you ever come near homer again, i'll strangle you with your own hair extensions. that's right, i know."
58291,Marge,"lisa. lisa honey, wake up!"
66407,Marge,our boat painting!
55678,Marge,homer!
60314,Marge,we want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product.
59229,Marge,"give them the plant, homer!"
66204,Marge,again? i was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
63979,Marge,"well, i want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
62777,Marge,i remember him.
61751,Marge,"lisa, that's not funny. you believe in the bill of rights."
58818,Marge,"oh... just once, i'd like a parrot to say that to me."
57016,Marge,i don't know what to say. i finally have a mother-in-law. no more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
65937,Marge,"homer's pie man costume, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, sunday-best bart..."
66770,Marge,homer... homer...
64748,Marge,why do you say such ridiculous things?
64123,Marge,"homer, what's going on? the violin, pants with a crease, why?"
58331,Marge,a dishonorable discharge! it's the best we could've hoped for.
64265,Marge,othello... richard the third...
65028,Marge,what?
64155,Marge,blue roses!
65469,Marge,"homer! people are here to see the movie, not listen to you!"
60268,Marge,i've been prying them apart since before you were born!
61353,Marge,i've already drawn up the petition.
63644,Marge,"well, maybe i could. but every time i look at you, i see the same adorable boy i fell in love with."
60720,Marge,a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
56485,Marge,homer--
60935,Marge,"i'm so sorry, reverend."
66924,Marge,"oh, bart, that's so sweet. it's the best present a mother could get and it makes you look so dangerous."
59594,Marge,do i have to be dead before you'll help me?
62761,Marge,"what? no! listen, charles, i don't want to hurt your feelings..."
59473,Marge,get it away from the house!
57348,Marge,guess i can't complain. everything's perfect here.
59451,Marge,i'm not sure mosquito season is the best time to visit larva lake...
61655,Marge,what about uncle tyrone?
62019,Marge,"everyone seemed so happy, but i'm surprised at ned. he left out all the good times cain and abel had when they were growing up."
66393,Marge,what pills?
65301,Marge,you'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
67205,Marge,sure.
55487,Marge,"grampa, you said that about all the presents."
64007,Marge,there are limits to how much two people should be together.
60018,Marge,doodlebugs!
56825,Marge,i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
57374,Marge,i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the world series!
57411,Marge,oh? i've lived in this town for 37 years.
54896,Marge,hello?
57392,Marge,kidnapped?!
67223,Marge,bart! quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
63719,Marge,"go, go, go, go, go!"
61902,Marge,well... oh. we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day. turns out he had an impacted anal gland.
54833,Marge,"doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, bart, you'd see how sane he is."
55217,Marge,"honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help."
56725,Marge,"you know, fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, i didn't even notice."
60559,Marge,"homer, it's over. i want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again."
66505,Marge,maggie! why'd you do that?
54615,Marge,"yeah, sure."
61455,Marge,"bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
60248,Marge,"oh. hello, lisa."
55686,Marge,no.
61502,Marge,"lisa, i'm surprised. your sister just wants to learn and be like you. well, maybe she needs a better role model."
64932,Marge,"well... homer got along so well with the other dads, i couldn't break it to him."
62693,Marge,no rudner.
60779,Marge,"oh, homie."
62351,Marge,"look, i know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't ."
58809,Marge,ooo.
66108,Marge,oh my god. our train! homie you do care. you care a lot!
61928,Marge,"lisa, let me explain what happened tonight. sometimes when your mom has half a glass of wine, she goes cuckoo bananas."
57540,Marge,"homer, please! i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. please just let it be."
60177,Marge,look at those massive plaid shoulders.
58042,Marge,"there has to be more to life than just what we see, lisa. everyone needs something to believe in."
56861,Marge,"years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
56045,Marge,"homer, you should be more supportive."
55000,Marge,"oh, homer!"
54940,Marge,that's ridiculous.
58233,Marge,"look, let's the three of us try it together."
66675,Marge,you ate the food and looked in the mirrors! they're staying.
65425,Marge,"bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes."
57027,Marge,they're ready.
65480,Marge,"busy day at work? did you get a lot of work done, workerman?"
62999,Marge,"see, lisa. we're making progress."
57260,Marge,are you sure? maybe it's just shampoo. that washes right out.
56397,Marge,"i want all five t-shirts to say, ""best vacation ever."""
61660,Marge,no!
55438,Marge,i thought my life would be a mardi gras/ a never-ending party -- ha!/ i'm a faded southern dame without a dime...
55874,Marge,it's so nice not to have to cook.
65470,Marge,"there was enough talking during the movie! this date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""date night."""
64209,Marge,"what if we got a small apartment there? we wouldn't have to live in it, but we would have a waverly hills address."
56316,Marge,oh!
67872,Marge,mr. burns. would you like to come in?
67291,Marge,now just a darn...
56802,Marge,oh for crying out loud...
61699,Marge,"i know one person who believes you were the pie man, homie... me. i've known it all along."
63337,Marge,besides that!
65860,Marge,"i know your grampa seems exciting now... but all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy."
66172,Marge,"you know what i think about regrets? as long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one."
57441,Marge,well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
55966,Marge,would you two like to go to the ballet?
66852,Marge,yes.
65275,Marge,i just got a b-mail from maggie -- she's gone into labor!
65445,Marge,well of course they don't.
64504,Marge,no surrender!
63658,Marge,yowza!
54772,Marge,"kids, could you lighten up a little?"
63319,Marge,"no, no. i'm fine."
66420,Marge,we should have it appraised!
56251,Marge,get out! get out! get out!
64398,Marge,"ned, you got whipped cream in your mustache!"
58767,Marge,"oh look, it's woody harrelson."
65093,Marge,we got out of it just in time.
58861,Marge,this better be important.
65027,Marge,i told you you should've stopped the tickling.
57448,Marge,"and now it's too late -- they're here. bart, greet our guests and take their coats."
62585,Marge,don't be so sure.
66968,Marge,"are you all right, homer?"
66865,Marge,yup. and i know a place that could use this smile.
58039,Marge,"oh, hello, agnes."
67779,Marge,"well, don't worry. there are still plenty of fish in the sea. right, homer?"
62208,Marge,"i'm psychic. look, i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars."
60824,Marge,what position is this?
64603,Marge,dealing drugs? that's impossible. he... he doesn't have the math skills!
67746,Marge,"oh, of course. it's thou shalt not... uh... covet... graven images... something about covet..."
56567,Marge,you think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
65064,Marge,i don't think this is a good idea at all. the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu. he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
60557,Marge,"good night, homer."
60993,Marge,"ms. sloane, i loved you in ""sleeping with pinocchio"" and ""honey, i scotchguarded the kids""."
64649,Marge,"homie, slow down!"
66721,Marge,"you always save me, trombone elephant."
60276,Marge,you and ned married a couple floozies?
59985,Marge,wonder where this river goes.
65276,Marge,lisa...
60444,Marge,"hi, honey. where's that vicious dog? i made him a biscuit."
66834,Marge,he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me.
57916,Marge,bart's gay?
55118,Marge,did you two have fun?
64688,Marge,"um, i'm gonna go read a book."
65507,Marge,"bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
62437,Marge,"oh kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. we're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here."
56001,Marge,mmm hmm.
65429,Marge,"you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? and when i wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!"
60528,Marge,works for me.
63713,Marge,it's your new diet!
64617,Marge,"homie, i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic. it usually does not end well."
58546,Marge,"oh, my good, gray extension cord."
62879,Marge,that sounds horrible!
56556,Marge,you see.
58652,Marge,lisa broke her own record -- by two whole plusses!
65699,Marge,we don't want a raccoon.
61154,Marge,wha...?!
63112,Marge,i wish i'd married lenny and his friend!
66456,Marge,"yeah, i was a little surprised i wasn't considered before. todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. por favor, perdoa-lhe."
61812,Marge,well...
58079,Marge,"excuse me, mr. szyslak, have you ever considered selling your home?"
65338,Marge,"usually when i say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. i'm gonna say goodnight before it does."
59393,Marge,"that is the best version of ""living in america"" i've ever heard."
66214,Marge,"homer! i know you're here, your car's outside!"
64929,Marge,"i remember why i left this group seven years ago, and it's why i'm leaving now! good day, ladies."
66080,Marge,"ooh, i love that show!"
64370,Marge,i've been pin-upped!
59541,Marge,there's our broadway baby!
63058,Marge,so they're not shipping you overseas?
55674,Marge,"honey, did you have any luck?"
59601,Marge,it was healthy. he reciprocated. he reciprocated!
59786,Marge,"they're unveiling a combination apron/smock. it's called a ""smapron."""
55045,Marge,luke?
61856,Marge,"no! no, i've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
60854,Marge,but there's no room for you.
66727,Marge,what?
56472,Marge,i've never been so proud of them.
59186,Marge,who's going to clean up all those jets?
57525,Marge,space coyote?
57790,Marge,you've just got to accept it. your gameboy is gone. it's at the bottom of the ocean.
55277,Marge,i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
61632,Marge,where's that coming from?
63940,Marge,we should be getting back to the party.
54942,Marge,stick to the subject.
65552,Marge,"well, cardinal or cannibal, i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love."
62937,Marge,"ooh, the baseball-playing man! i barely recognized you without your costume on."
62881,Marge,i'm sorry you have to leave. but i just can't think of another way.
67579,Marge,yes.
58144,Marge,so you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago.
60609,Marge,you'll get the hang of it. today's just a little gusty.
67719,Marge,homer!
57543,Marge,"these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! and look at the fine stitching on ""dope!"""
66200,Marge,are you mocking me?!
59781,Marge,"okay, it's in his brain."
60213,Marge,burly to the rescue!
67231,Marge,my suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
62267,Marge,"vegetables, you've been promoted from side dish to entrée."
66446,Marge,"to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil, like we had the last time, i'm learning the language."
67328,Marge,"oh, homer."
67635,Marge,"bart, please."
56704,Marge,i don't think you're stupid.
60806,Marge,almost done.
62962,Marge,all he did was try to help a young couple find their way. does he really deserve to get strung up for that?
59961,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous."
62191,Marge,"homer, we're separated now. you can't just walk in without knocking."
60975,Marge,"well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?"
56554,Marge,"sure, okay. i'll talk about father. father christmas. that's what they call santa claus in england. they drive on the wrong side of the road there. now that's crazy. people are always saying how small england is. but you couldn't fit it all in here. not by a long shot. you know what? i'm cured."
66743,Marge,i don't know.
60124,Marge,"oh, homie, no. we can't."
64539,Marge,"let's have lunch at ""crouching tiger hidden eggroll."""
60406,Marge,you need that surgery. we'll have to call artie.
59552,Marge,sure. it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
58867,Marge,get out of the way!
61999,Marge,that sounds like homer.
64465,Marge,"well, i kind of got a clue when i heard that ""ballooning safety"" video."
59237,Marge,"okay, sure."
66866,Marge,"lenny said you were babysitting. and if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? i could use a night out."
63665,Marge,"well, this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good."
58663,Marge,this should be very educational. i want you kids to pay attention.
63520,Marge,"well, i guess he told me not to worry."
57433,Marge,"at least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we? lisa, how was school?"
59445,Marge,rockin' fun zone? that sounds funnn...
62243,Marge,"wait, there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense. why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear?"
63425,Marge,"how you holdin' up, maggie?"
63432,Marge,what'd i miss?
61618,Marge,well...
63474,Marge,"see? isn't it nicer, with just you and..."
62012,Marge,love love will keep us together
61405,Marge,"""...mayor quimby, disco stu, and our fighting men and women overseas."" well, i finished the ""thank yous,"" time to go back to the novel."
57025,Marge,yeah.
64856,Marge,i bought it because catherine zeta jones told me to. what a fool i was.
63360,Marge,you make her stop! i've had her all day!
61210,Marge,"okay, you can help us."
66590,Marge,yikes!
67472,Marge,"well, okay. let's see... can you do the cranberry sauce?"
56587,Marge,"homer, you promised. one night of family time a week. besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
55897,Marge,that man is so rude.
56438,Marge,"oh that's sweet, homer. our son is growing up, isn't he?"
63749,Marge,of course -- you're lisa. lisa the dancing marge girl.
57520,Marge,yeah.
62735,Marge,"i'll do it! wait, i wasn't happy with that."
57114,Marge,uh-huh.
57398,Marge,"honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals. you can stay right here and give the dog a bath. or trim the cat's nails."
67168,Marge,yes.
66698,Marge,homer works at a nuclear plant! he can help us get home!
66588,Marge,lenny used the uck-word!
63737,Marge,they came in one at a time.
57207,Marge,what kind of apprentice?
61357,Marge,i wish to announce the formation of ppassccatag: proud parents against singles seniors childless couples and teens and gays.
62726,Marge,i'm not wearing a hat!
61883,Marge,uh-huh.
55052,Marge,i do.
64971,Marge,"i'm okay, i'm okay."
65387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. a diaper just isn't sexy."
58508,Marge,"i'm not saying you're a bad inventor. i'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. or accept them as gifts."
58794,Marge,i didn't turn it on yet.
56064,Marge,"oh my god, barney, thank you. i would never have forgiven myself."
60591,Marge,"kids, we want to talk to you about something."
59048,Marge,"oh, homie."
63312,Marge,i'd like that very much.
61540,Marge,"artie, thank you for doing the right thing. eventually."
65310,Marge,"uh oh, a draggy backpack."
64789,Marge,"yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
61969,Marge,"well, maybe i'll go to moe's too, seeing as i'm now part owner."
55304,Marge,"now, now, he's an ex-convict. he's paid his debt to society."
59144,Marge,o-kayyy.
64417,Marge,"the yawning monkey? ""the pair of tongs?"""
64816,Marge,you what?!
56742,Marge,"okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
64861,Marge,it wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
60695,Marge,i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing.
61499,Marge,"well, then... find a new identity."
62362,Marge,"i'm at a rest stop south of springfield. i know, you're sorry now. then you'll buy me some kwik-e-mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
60784,Marge,your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
57558,Marge,"i'm sorry, agnes."
55636,Marge,bad baby!
66934,Marge,homer! why are you seven hours late?
64800,Marge,my memorables!
56240,Marge,that's nice.
55848,Marge,"oh, that's right. i invited a guest speaker to talk to the class."
57640,Marge,you're missing the itchy and scratchy show! don't you like it anymore?
65955,Marge,"fine. i'm getting rid of this american masters ""kitty carlisle."""
61605,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
54873,Marge,"well, bart's been acting very strangely. and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
57373,Marge,"thank you, moe. i know you gave up your dreams for homer."
60595,Marge,"manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
65109,Marge,"don't do that, homie. it rubs off your side hair."
66537,Marge,nothing. i give up. no more dinner parties. our whole social life will be us watching tv and you going to moe's.
67772,Marge,it's patty who chose the life of celibacy. selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
60754,Marge,"don't worry, maggie, i'll have these silly things out in just two days. till then i'll just try to hide them from the family."
58447,Marge,"heyyy, look at that."
55321,Marge,"hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
56097,Marge,"oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
63971,Marge,"jackie ""o."" like spaghetti-o's. i thought that was where her money came from. look, why don't you cheer up by doing a new york times crossword puzzle, huh?"
60770,Marge,"kiki, i'm tired of trade show modeling. my back really hurts."
59818,Marge,"oh, and guess who's up for parole? my diamond-in-the-rough."
56559,Marge,why does daddy have to leave?
57801,Marge,"no, he's disappeared. oh, i'm in way over my head. i mean, where do the helpers turn when they need help?"
57007,Marge,what are you talking about?
61029,Marge,"you're so cute when you're begging for sex, but i'm just too tired."
56175,Marge,then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
56280,Marge,what! what?
54710,Marge,he cares so much about those doggone dugongs. i wish i felt that kind of passion. maybe i should join him on his mission...
65106,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie."
63103,Marge,"homer, i wanna show the world how i feel about you."
63313,Marge,i was killed... by my own son.
65181,Marge,what's the craziest thing on the menu?
58695,Marge,homer!
65008,Marge,"haul away, driver man!"
66247,Marge,"well, that's sort of what i was trying to say. but..."
58787,Marge,"tomorrow?! well, that's too bad, mister. i'm not gonna bail you out this time."
60785,Marge,bart! watch your potty mouth!
64093,Marge,"well, it would be nice if the first thing i saw was a world at peace..."
59848,Marge,"oh, geez..."
57571,Marge,you see? a little persistence and patience paid off. that'll be 300 dollars.
56127,Marge,"bart, i told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
58114,Marge,but i...
62547,Marge,"oh captain, you're so handy!"
59889,Marge,lisa!
60565,Marge,what are you doing here?
67500,Marge,"oh, my special little guy! we were so worried!"
59446,Marge,i don't see the need for razor wire.
60264,Marge,let's stick to original monopoly -- the game is crazy enough as it is.
57227,Marge,that does it. one of them has to go.
61627,Marge,"they're all too old to be dressed up like super-people. homer, let's just hurry up and go home so i can yell at you."
65951,Marge,we can have the reception at wong lee's!
62917,Marge,"lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. my son's a brat but he's a special little guy. your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
57990,Marge,"down here, homer."
55843,Marge,you're going to get an education. i'm going to teach you myself.
67397,Marge,sorry. your game is very nice.
56296,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
62024,Marge,i can't take any more!
65186,Marge,"so, did all of your cars break down?"
67785,Marge,"any luck, homie?"
59726,Marge,"the dog thinks so, too."
67630,Marge,"i suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars."
54791,Marge,a-positive.
57743,Marge,"oh, it's against the house rule... oh, i guess just this once."
64928,Marge,you know nothing about my son and even less about apples.
61263,Marge,tony... i mean mr. prime minister... what should we see first?
61422,Marge,i suppose i better. your father's a very private person.
67096,Marge,"can you believe this, homer? ... homer? ... homer?"
54676,Marge,"well, i think you're helping us make progress."
59325,Marge,finally...
60571,Marge,"if you ask me, you should give up fatty foods."
55997,Marge,maybe we should call it a night.
66302,Marge,homie...
58031,Marge,"oh apu, give it up."
59755,Marge,"homie! homie, wake up! they've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!"
56089,Marge,"oh, stop blaming the beans."
64717,Marge,"it's not your fault, grampa. these cards are too slippery. see?"
66068,Marge,what? now? why?
64495,Marge,but homer tries his best.
66749,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm tired of being a pushover."
62048,Marge,"excuse me, reverend."
65474,Marge,"homer, i'm a single mother trying to raise a family here."
61871,Marge,"and uh, where's your dad in all this?"
60715,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, but it's time to come home."
56204,Marge,"honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey december morn."
67642,Marge,"oh my lord. well, i don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
56906,Marge,"bart, it's class photo day. no dracula fangs."
61658,Marge,so much for getting my groove back.
61770,Marge,"yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. the garage made it to heaven too!"
66335,Marge,"maggie, he's here!"
65398,Marge,"relax, everyone knows that if you die in a dream, you just wake up!"
65619,Marge,the place that changed my life?
66326,Marge,"well, i'm not happy with you."
63190,Marge,bart was on the boat?!
62218,Marge,and why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
66577,Marge,mammogram appointment.
57749,Marge,"well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get santa's little helper back."
66952,Marge,"you look very intelligent, dear."
64622,Marge,does he have a cute accent?
67910,Marge,no.
56581,Marge,"aw, homie. you know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
56357,Marge,"no, oh, artie!"
56723,Marge,homer! bart! maggie! company eating rules.
56731,Marge,i think there's really something wrong with santa's little helper. he was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
61837,Marge,...because you let me down.
58878,Marge,"thanks for asking. well, i was watching dateline and stone philips said s.u.v.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat."
56144,Marge,"honey, i'm so glad you're home--"
59993,Marge,"it's kind of you to take us in, dr. bushwell."
58317,Marge,"okay, great. you kids have fun."
55407,Marge,"no, homer."
60809,Marge,he's betrothed to martha take-a-punch.
62164,Marge,"which came first, turkey the bird or turkey the you guys?"
58007,Marge,"you know, homer, it's very easy to criticize."
67419,Marge,"lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."
60493,Marge,don't burn her! she's just an innocent child!
56366,Marge,"mmmm, homie..."
59309,Marge,why are you doing that?
56577,Marge,kids can be so cruel.
64531,Marge,"y'know -- i think bart might have too much homework. if they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
63568,Marge,thank you.
62971,Marge,"no problem, i'll just drive up to your house and get it."
57132,Marge,you didn't vote for anybody.
57123,Marge,why don't you read something?
60947,Marge,i can't believe you talked me into this.
66757,Marge,"abe simpson, please."
57043,Marge,"rockabye baby in the tree top / when the wind blows / the cradle will rock / when the bough breaks / the cradle will fall / and down will come baby, cradle and all."
63255,Marge,look at grampa and selma frolicking in the water.
58995,Marge,"and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. by the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. they call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
58594,Marge,"oh, you couldn't destroy every politician."
55428,Marge,"for god's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!"
55520,Marge,"well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
63831,Marge,"it doesn't work that way, homie."
66341,Marge,"hello, homie! dinner's almost ready! pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
65401,Marge,we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
62369,Marge,i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me.
66818,Marge,oh lord.
61985,Marge,"homer, moe and i are just work friends. you and i are... marriage friends."
65759,Marge,"except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job."
60805,Marge,no!
61687,Marge,"where were you, homie? you missed all the excitement."
57770,Marge,well... okay. i will volunteer!
63761,Marge,she turned down lenny... and carl? that's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hotdogs. what could make her hate men like that?
57793,Marge,hello. listen lady.
66122,Marge,you're talking about my husband!
59456,Marge,"be nice to your brother, lisa."
65270,Marge,"not since they passed ""homer's law."" oh honey, why don't you just relax and bake something?"
63716,Marge,searching for evidence. i know your father's cheating on his diet.
62965,Marge,marriage is hard work. but it's worth it -- when you've got someone wonderful like i do.
67003,Marge,"gee, homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?"
61102,Marge,"you, homie."
60981,Marge,"congratulations, sweetie. you're in the finals!"
60021,Marge,hibbert's really losing it. we're going to dr. nick's.
56431,Marge,homer! the sky is blue. donuts are plentiful. friday is tgif night on abc. what's gotten into you?
66201,Marge,come on! just pick one!
66666,Marge,"homer, do something!"
60157,Marge,there's no drugs out there.
61392,Marge,"anyone? if i write a book, will they tell me when it comes out?"
56103,Marge,"i saved these for you, bart. you'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
65051,Marge,oh screw it.
55562,Marge,but... what do i do?
60767,Marge,"don't make a fuss over me, boys. just pour me a beer in a clean glass."
63959,Marge,/
63455,Marge,"now you listen here, bub. we paid you all the savings we had in the world. you could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
62382,Marge,homer?
55455,Marge,"that's a terrible thing to say. kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
63904,Marge,"wow, lenny went all out!"
61899,Marge,"terrace. evergreen terrace. the street that smells like pee. this is my daughter, lisa."
65852,Marge,"don't you want to be happy, abe? admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!"
65085,Marge,this ends now!
57562,Marge,i'll take it!
55612,Marge,our driveway's snowed in!
60763,Marge,"keep in mind, they're only temporaries."
63799,Marge,although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
58673,Marge,"well, doctor hibbert said you have to build up your strength."
61012,Marge,"occasionally, you might hear a faint roar..."
55542,Marge,"homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
59386,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't care if you're a billionaire. i love you just because you're..."
64335,Marge,i guess i could!
60712,Marge,you work a job you don't like so i'm able to be home with the kids.
64170,Marge,"okay, no more delays. i've got to watch this."
65420,Marge,it's no fun to live in a town with a ninety-nine percent unemployment rate.
62903,Marge,"oh, and her."
63162,Marge,i'll ask these active seniors if they know gil.
65173,Marge,that newborn has earrings!
57612,Marge,all right... but don't be shocked.
56151,Marge,underpants.
60846,Marge,i agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. i had to share mine with my uncle.
63438,Marge,we have to take in mr. brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
64436,Marge,i don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
56524,Marge,"i don't know, homer. we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season."
57585,Marge,"yeah, that's it."
60882,Marge,amen. over.
58491,Marge,"that doesn't sound like me. well, i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant."
67216,Marge,"sorry, homer."
61683,Marge,more alive than any of you squares!
55154,Marge,i swear.
54674,Marge,"this is all your fault, homer, for wanting somebody new!"
55022,Marge,you don't know homer like i do. he's sensitive and sweet.
62359,Marge,"bye bart! i love you, lisa! sleep tight, maggie! today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
61960,Marge,i just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars!
57479,Marge,"he's a whole new person, lisa!"
59377,Marge,"homer, did you jimmy open mr. burns' liquor cabinet?"
58054,Marge,"otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives."
64400,Marge,"ned, there's only one man i should be eating whipped cream with."
62560,Marge,this is my husband homer.
58911,Marge,ooh-woo. a complimentary basket of hooves.
60410,Marge,forwards?
66814,Marge,what's wrong homer? is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
55840,Marge,in a minute!
59358,Marge,so he's stuck like this forever?
59725,Marge,"oh, homie!"
65084,Marge,because i have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. turns out it was a substitute.
54621,Marge,"oh my god, you're a junkie!"
65456,Marge,homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
57923,Marge,"homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
57844,Marge,i certainly hope so! that's better.
59973,Marge,and these musical garment bags aren't bad either.
59969,Marge,what? what?
67666,Marge,homer? homer?
56897,Marge,"no. no, no. when i took your father's name, i took everything that came with it, including d.n.a."
65715,Marge,"i can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush..."
62476,Marge,i'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
60694,Marge,"homie, something very creepy is going on here."
62399,Marge,so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
61216,Marge,"i don't think maggie wants you out of her life, moe."
56685,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, and i have an idea."
59744,Marge,"could you cut it out, you two? mommy needs some quiet right now."
60254,Marge,lisa?
65211,Marge,um... i don't know. probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts.
60566,Marge,"so, i guess you can't destroy earth, since so many of your favorite celebrities live and work there."
62115,Marge,you don't smoke!
62835,Marge,"goodbye, mr. simpson."
55079,Marge,"homer, i'm not pregnant."
59529,Marge,"fine, you win. i'll do your shopping for you."
63600,Marge,no.
64511,Marge,"very good, bart."
57379,Marge,no! what if he's crazy?
62262,Marge,"bart, what are you doing here?"
63688,Marge,"hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets."
59556,Marge,"ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this saturday... to join otto and becky at... 742 evergreen terrace? that's our address!"
57297,Marge,"honey, you'll make plenty of friends. all you have to do is be yourself."
59636,Marge,... a smile.
67353,Marge,"he's much happier at work and, well, just between us girls... well, he hasn't been this frisky in years."
59434,Marge,you've only been gone two days.
58920,Marge,"oh, all right. good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip."
59157,Marge,how about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? huh? we could go to krusty burger...
64585,Marge,no one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!
55523,Marge,"well, we brought some pizza."
58537,Marge,killer? why did he call you killer?
55606,Marge,"we drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""all you can eat"" fish restaurant."
66270,Marge,"for your information, gloria, my ""wassail"" is just gatorade i put in the microwave!"
55351,Marge,how cute.
66045,Marge,"oh homie, what a wonderful anniversary!"
67107,Marge,well then come down for breakfast.
67414,Marge,"no, i'm just fine right here."
65556,Marge,"homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?"
60662,Marge,huh?
64100,Marge,if i'm more relaxed i'll be a better mom! can we? can we?
59619,Marge,"""the malarkeys,"" ""dumbin' it down""..."
64184,Marge,maybe i'll keep this to myself for a while.
64571,Marge,"and homer, put on some pants."
56912,Marge,shoo! get outta here!
58455,Marge,"heh, heh. yeah."
58303,Marge,ralph certainly has a lot of imagination.
55044,Marge,bob?
62886,Marge,hello there.
66643,Marge,"i understand, honey. did you get someone to cover?"
55829,Marge,oh my god.
58799,Marge,and what's in this?
56573,Marge,"oh, homer. don't start stalking people again. it's so illegal. remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
66862,Marge,whatever you want.
59739,Marge,you talk too much. abra-ca-blab-ra! am i right?
64318,Marge,is he okay?
66022,Marge,confidence is so attractive in a man.
60283,Marge,bigamy.
58571,Marge,why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with maggie and me?
60375,Marge,that sounds great.
65966,Marge,"moe, i know things haven't been easy for you. but you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities."
54789,Marge,"what are you doing, honey?"
59304,Marge,"ohh, i just swept the circle of death!"
56791,Marge,aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
67173,Marge,homer... homer.
55370,Marge,whoooa!!
64074,Marge,oh my god. we're out on the street!
64281,Marge,"oh, homie... take your shirt off again."
67372,Marge,"well, he certainly must have been motivated. prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this."
60036,Marge,"it's all right, boys."
67558,Marge,no. i'm sorry about the dinners. i'll make up for it tomorrow night.
66410,Marge,"ooo, that could be the one."
56734,Marge,"no, no, our dog is out of control. he's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority."
58396,Marge,"""in case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician."" oh my goodness!"
56074,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i have been spending too much time at the casino. i'll be around more from now on."
62404,Marge,"homer, can you help me out here?"
64512,Marge,i made it into a sampler!
54733,Marge,"now, homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. remember last year at the winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
62631,Marge,"you know, if i was born three months later, emerald would be my birthstone."
61150,Marge,i've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him.
66192,Marge,i feel kind of... melancholy...
59763,Marge,"come on, homer. they're only in town for eight months, then they're gone!"
59319,Marge,"well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the..."
57372,Marge,"oh, that's all right. we'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
63333,Marge,"oh, yeah, that's really something."
64262,Marge,"no, i just encouraged him."
57236,Marge,"homer! that's just an urban legend. people don't do that type of thing with fish. troy mcclure is a perfect gentlemen, like bing crosby or jfk. i wonder where troy is now?"
58565,Marge,"ooooh-woo! wow. if your fly weren't open, you'd look just like roger moore."
57127,Marge,"i don't care who's consolidating their power. well, we don't need this."
64945,Marge,homer! we only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
66851,Marge,sure!
63164,Marge,"gil, remember me?"
67908,Marge,no.
59871,Marge,you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today. i found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
58302,Marge,is that normal?
63822,Marge,"come on, homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever."
56232,Marge,hm? hm?
57306,Marge,"lisa, that's not at all like you."
62271,Marge,but your song said you liked springfield.
61114,Marge,this is where duffman lives now. but i'm not sure we should go in there.
57980,Marge,you lied to me! you promised to get rid of this gun!
66095,Marge,chat room?
58221,Marge,we what?
59080,Marge,"but mr. ambassador, how are we going to get home?"
60583,Marge,"oh, this is so awkward. today's the day we play badminton with them. oh, i hope no one makes any double entendres."
62309,Marge,bart! turn away from that screen and look out the window!
54928,Marge,"don't worry, honey, i'm sure your father is..."
55899,Marge,no!
56946,Marge,"hmm. bart, what's wrong? there's something a little off about your hug."
55830,Marge,"well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. wait, maybe it does."
61449,Marge,...sent lewis and clark and some embedded journalists to find the northwest passage.
66914,Marge,"oh, dear. maybe bart is a little more realistic."
59806,Marge,"okay. now, i wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut."
61094,Marge,"thir-what year old?!! lisa, you're only eight."
55163,Marge,hi homie. i feel much better.
63290,Marge,everyone can see you! get inside!
67950,Marge,you know who else fell? dr. hibbert!
65481,Marge,don't give me that load of--
66762,Marge,where is this party?!
65184,Marge,holy casserole-y! that's good gloop!
60068,Marge,"oh, look! a shooting star!"
61017,Marge,how can you say that?
60535,Marge,"all right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?"
57524,Marge,...a profound mystical understanding?
67854,Marge,you can put a little something on top for flavor.
62505,Marge,a tea house?!
54743,Marge,we'll be there!
66048,Marge,"well, thanks for watching maggie. i just ordered homer's anniversary gift."
54921,Marge,bart!
64576,Marge,"shalom to you! shalom is the ""aloha"" of this place."
57452,Marge,lisa! why don't you come sing for us!
67361,Marge,"homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?"
58013,Marge,"well, at least i'm making conversation."
57584,Marge,"oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn."
59119,Marge,you mean like john leguizamo?
62139,Marge,you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
56662,Marge,"i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that. he may not be a big success like you, but i can always count on him to provide for the family."
58192,Marge,i don't know.
59881,Marge,"well, actually, the name of bart's partner is..."
54716,Marge,"i know what homer's thinking. he's thinking that he really wants a baby now. so this should be the time, ironically, that i'll change my mind and not want one. well, no way! i want one more than ever!"
66540,Marge,and lisa will get a friend.
62854,Marge,"ooh, i can't wait to see what kind of home we live in."
57830,Marge,yes! and it might look something like this...
54771,Marge,"oh my, the house looks wonderful. grampa, what's your secret?"
56692,Marge,"""you can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
61771,Marge,that sounds like maggie. but she's right here...
65305,Marge,"lenny, do you live here?"
63408,Marge,well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
58640,Marge,you shouldn't be watching the learning channel. you need to take it easy.
66375,Marge,i am so tired of those kids sniggering.
63544,Marge,"all right, this time i'm going. i'm really going to visit a bank robber. a man who held a gun on me. going to see him in prison, where guards will frisk me, paw through my purse, and... oooh, there's apple picking just up the road!"
55145,Marge,noooooooo!!
66836,Marge,"oh, kids, stop arguing. or keep arguing. i don't care. homer, i'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight. i'm not sure of anything anymore. sorry i ever open my mouth."
57846,Marge,"i tell you, chief, i just don't know what we're going to do with him."
64931,Marge,awww...
57726,Marge,"homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. your homemade liquor is exploding again."
58286,Marge,lisa! come on! your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
63289,Marge,it's our house! but what's that thing?
67590,Marge,that's nice dear.
61749,Marge,"you were right, homie. we shouldn't have rocked the boat. then none of this would have ever happened."
58384,Marge,my casserole is not filth. eat it.
65579,Marge,"maggie's not a baby! her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months! being a mom is who i am, and i'm not done being who i am."
58231,Marge,"now, how are we going to get my homie back?"
63271,Marge,it sure was nice of nasa to send you up again.
56329,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
66037,Marge,"oh, that's perfect."
59700,Marge,"oh, no. my baby's up there!"
62952,Marge,i always say that.
59517,Marge,"okay, bart. i'll sweet-talk the sheriff, while you grab his keys."
67514,Marge,"yes, well, we saw a daredevil last night and, well, you know, monkey see, monkey do."
58617,Marge,"you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc."
64228,Marge,where have you been? we have mirrors to hang!
62163,Marge,"hey, it's only money. and it did make a cool splash."
54607,Marge,homer! you're embarrassing me!
61596,Marge,that doesn't look so big.
54956,Marge,"homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
60682,Marge,aww.
59516,Marge,i'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip.
67677,Marge,uh... well....
60393,Marge,mm-hmmm!
66213,Marge,"wow, i've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick!"
60968,Marge,i could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
55809,Marge,homie!
57742,Marge,"""some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
60077,Marge,"oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade..."
58846,Marge,"kids, cut it out!"
64496,Marge,well who made you the coach?
59111,Marge,ooh!
62609,Marge,get him outta here!
55766,Marge,"well, i got an idea! why don't you run a hamster through a maze?"
62862,Marge,milhouse! you're bart's best friend!
59439,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i just thought you..."
56847,Marge,"i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
63364,Marge,"sweetheart, come to dinner."
67292,Marge,"well, maggie, it's just you and me again."
54647,Marge,"look, a wedding!"
58413,Marge,what happened to grampa? he was supposed to baby-sit.
63180,Marge,"i guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember."
64146,Marge,homie?
66776,Marge,doesn't your culture say anything about mercy?
59568,Marge,"bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
66388,Marge,"grampa, what happened?"
64863,Marge,"so, lisa. do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece?"
63032,Marge,why does lenny need a windmill anyway?
56065,Marge,"now you stay put, young lady."
57892,Marge,did you ever tell him that?
63763,Marge,"lurleen lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and i'm gonna fill it."
59817,Marge,"terrific. bart, sideshow bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
63961,Marge,"i know. we had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. the important thing is, we love each other."
57666,Marge,"homer, listen carefully: john is a ho-mo--"
65692,Marge,milhouse?!
57314,Marge,"you got ""the dud!"""
65174,Marge,i guess we could make a sprint for one of these local establishments.
62616,Marge,"i've never noticed that sign before, and i'm a very good noticer."
61270,Marge,"homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever."
58348,Marge,"i'm proud of you, honey. you're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much."
64019,Marge,sounds promising so far!
56349,Marge,that's not my mother.
55394,Marge,la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
60030,Marge,shoo!
61307,Marge,"oh, homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. i'm proud of you."
56537,Marge,in a little while.
66541,Marge,i don't know! i invited everyone that lisa's ever met.
63066,Marge,don't you dare go limp!
57776,Marge,"no, i... i... wait, i can't... i-- hello...?"
65517,Marge,"now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. i stopped reading after ""top student""."
55449,Marge,"get up, homer. it's time for church."
62081,Marge,i always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families.
65424,Marge,do a lot of people pay?
56591,Marge,"here's bart sleeping... here he is dozing... here he is after a visit from the sandman... ooh, here's nappy-time bart... here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
63053,Marge,what?! homer! our son joined the army!
54588,Marge,you leave me sitting here all alone...
67078,Marge,the boys certainly are taking a long time. i hope maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
60747,Marge,"that's funny. hm, i don't feel sucked out."
61184,Marge,those cavalry kids are bigger credit hogs than the red cross.
60389,Marge,congratulations on your recent tv appearance.
63710,Marge,did you just unlock the car from here?
57669,Marge,"i'm very sorry you feel that way. because john invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
67318,Marge,"homer, you look just like a little boy."
67830,Marge,"my quilt! six generations, gone."
59189,Marge,"oh, all right."
67667,Marge,"oh, homer, homer."
63950,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil! but i think we should unpack first..."
57397,Marge,and where is all that liquor coming from?
67681,Marge,not if i have to do heavy lifting or math.
56244,Marge,"homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
63807,Marge,"lisa, how could you?"
67019,Marge,"excuse me, dear. shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our tv back?"
59313,Marge,what about mr. burns? maybe he'll help us out.
64875,Marge,"you can make it through this, marge. just think of homer."
65441,Marge,"lisa, are you out there in your slippers? come inside!"
65455,Marge,you'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us... enough!
58653,Marge,"oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. by the way, i oiled the hinge on your diary."
61314,Marge,"excuse me, can i ask you a favor?"
60331,Marge,that's the best one!
66090,Marge,hmm... maybe i can help.
57406,Marge,"oh, lisa, i know it's frustrating. but we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
56344,Marge,"well, as jerry lee lewis would say: ""there's a whole lotta frowning going on."""
64099,Marge,what is that soothing sound?
63020,Marge,perfect!
60363,Marge,it's seven-thirty!
66231,Marge,this is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!
56132,Marge,"but on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
57717,Marge,i don't think it had broken axles before.
65764,Marge,maybe we'd better go.
57534,Marge,good doggy. good doggy!
67821,Marge,homer!
66128,Marge,dear christian god...
66421,Marge,oh my god!
62190,Marge,"oh it's so great. we can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. i'm so proud of you. lisa, graduating two years early, and bart... graduating."
63033,Marge,"switch, switch, switch."
58893,Marge,"homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!"
57494,Marge,"i started making some calls last night, and before i knew it, practically all of springfield was offering to help."
64731,Marge,well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
58441,Marge,"oh, knock it off, you perverts."
65343,Marge,i feel kinda silly i walked all the way out here. you're just fine. you always are.
67541,Marge,... please try to tone down the psychotic violence...
67466,Marge,"here you go, bart. a lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer."
67827,Marge,i don't know.
63251,Marge,what the heck are these?
65274,Marge,"oh, it's so good to meet the octuplets' octuplets."
61180,Marge,"let's go, boys. make sure you use pine sol on those pine trees, for that pine fresh smell."
66959,Marge,shhh!
58512,Marge,"oh, i just mopped that driveway."
63179,Marge,much better.
54781,Marge,the poor boy is so desperate. he wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
66813,Marge,"car, wake grampa."
55708,Marge,we're too late!
63933,Marge,"homer simpson, i wish i'd never met you!"
63622,Marge,we have a family.
63466,Marge,hi... you!
56149,Marge,"that was a very nice thing you did, homey."
57286,Marge,cannons are designed to hurt. they're designed to hurt.
60509,Marge,oh.
66147,Marge,"never give up hope, my friends."
65465,Marge,"i know my son did a terrible thing. but there's a chapel on this ship, and in that chapel there's a book, and it says, ""judge not, lest ye--"
67523,Marge,a dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...
62268,Marge,"bart, don't use that word... oh crap."
66127,Marge,well... i guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
63021,Marge,i'm here to fix your bookcase. you answered my flyer.
67774,Marge,and not just any man.
55648,Marge,"bart, get out!"
54636,Marge,"three to five, right?"
66576,Marge,"/ oh! breathe, homie, breathe!"
67739,Marge,ooh. that's a good idea.
62753,Marge,no.
57656,Marge,"yes, i have something that i'd like to sell."
67853,Marge,"now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece."
62109,Marge,homie!
64803,Marge,you kids play nice up there!
64895,Marge,you never took me to that bar on the beach.
58112,Marge,mm-hmm.
56979,Marge,homer? get ready. patty and selma will be here any minute.
59047,Marge,"oh! you're not going anywhere, missy."
66745,Marge,homer simpson!
55149,Marge,homer
56624,Marge,yes.
56185,Marge,"homer, say something."
62300,Marge,but we don't have a sitter for maggie.
54815,Marge,"whatever it does, it's doing it now."
64546,Marge,well then there won't be any sex!
62448,Marge,"no, no, no!"
55993,Marge,"beautiful, huh? homer and i used to come up here on dates."
66267,Marge,all eggnog is terrible!
58901,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, i need some gossip, here! where is everybody? does this town shut down at 5 o'clock?"
59136,Marge,bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and i could have a night out!
64614,Marge,"homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
64244,Marge,and she lived happily ever after?
65446,Marge,there is no mrs. steak. who could stay married to such a man.
66430,Marge,"oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?"
61978,Marge,this place is a diamond / but it's trapped in the rough
61754,Marge,wait right here for our encore...
59463,Marge,gold bars discovered by homer?
59409,Marge,so many horses. i don't know who to vote for. can't i just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?
58664,Marge,i never realized history was so filthy.
65904,Marge,"well, that does sound good..."
64736,Marge,"stay cool, marge. stay cool..."
66020,Marge,is it your impression of mr. burns eating soup? because i'm not in the mood.
58635,Marge,"ohh, how are you feeling, sweetie?"
58407,Marge,"lisa, we're home! sorry about the museum! you'd better go up and apologize."
61606,Marge,you're getting acid in the bed!
60485,Marge,"okay, it has been twenty years, and you suitors have been very patient."
67440,Marge,"let's see. upper, upper, upper mezzanine. hmmm. yes, these must be ours."
54589,Marge,...while you play video games with your neanderthal friends.
55081,Marge,"bart, your grampa's on the phone. he wants to wish you a happy birthday."
67659,Marge,sometimes it's fun to use candles.
55854,Marge,"hello, barney. are you playing the town drunk?"
65091,Marge,we've gotta get her out of there! babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake!
60959,Marge,"please don't go, bart. i'll let you swear in the house. everything but the big three."
61197,Marge,"grampa, stop!"
66008,Marge,"bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart."
64642,Marge,homer my mother's party's starting any minute. get busy.
60522,Marge,"well done bart, but in brazil they speak portuguese."
54744,Marge,we're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. no fishing.
67197,Marge,you certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
65597,Marge,"ooh, homie, you've lost weight."
60328,Marge,"gee, everyone looks so happy."
57797,Marge,"oh, good morning, maude."
61949,Marge,let me wash it off.
60228,Marge,where's bart?
55129,Marge,"well, i just don't know."
66031,Marge,maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
61959,Marge,"now that mr. burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases."
61215,Marge,"thanks, moe. i'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
67678,Marge,"lisa, i'd rather tell you a different story. how your father and i first met and fell in love."
57273,Marge,"you know what? i'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
65888,Marge,"if they can be that rude, the food must be great!"
56133,Marge,"oh, i am so proud of you. and i know it's going to go just fine..."
62084,Marge,"lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?"
62908,Marge,"oh, i always liked that guy!"
55682,Marge,my husband is still alive!
64802,Marge,"oh, that's ancient history. ooh, here's my paper on ancient history."
64089,Marge,skee-biddy-bob-boo! dot-doobiddy-dum-doo!
61859,Marge,they grow up so fast.
65871,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie? is a book character having difficulties?"
57063,Marge,"well, if loving my kids is ""lame,"" then i guess i'm just a big lame."
57497,Marge,homer!
61734,Marge,"oh, you children are too suspicious. it's go time."
65400,Marge,homie! we're here to find answers to your problem!
63261,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day."
62272,Marge,"sweetie, tonight you were perfect..."
61053,Marge,ing...
56358,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
65616,Marge,"there's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy..."
55264,Marge,"oh, there's a spot, dear."
55982,Marge,"i am lucky. i have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much."
66014,Marge,"no, he cheated."
59022,Marge,"you're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?"
60691,Marge,dr. hibbert? but we heard you'd gone mad.
62278,Marge,you have?! that's so nice!
61313,Marge,i think these are my homie's size...
66224,Marge,"well i'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. i thought that was strange poop on your collar."
63705,Marge,"kids, knock it off. i'm uncomfortable driving your father's car as it is."
58980,Marge,"hmm, i don't know. i studied art for years, but i just don't get this."
63125,Marge,you really made my daughter's christmas.
63240,Marge,"ooh, how about ""little bo peep?"""
65399,Marge,at last we'll get to the bottom of...
65089,Marge,what's wrong?
60900,Marge,wow!
55482,Marge,oh grampa!
64158,Marge,"here's the score, mister:"
64859,Marge,"no! for once, a pet ""going to a farm upstate"" really is going to a farm upstate."
62165,Marge,"if you don't want to say it, just think it."
57409,Marge,i have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from springfield.
59464,Marge,"""dear countryman: you have come in search of my gold, and i will not disappoint you."""
67301,Marge,yeah.
59618,Marge,nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. they almost drove me to fortified wine!
64712,Marge,"no appetite, honey?"
67239,Marge,"oh, he's sunk even lower!"
62934,Marge,only if he'll kiss me back.
64377,Marge,maybe this will take your mind off work.
56441,Marge,i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities. but then i'd be afraid of smothering him.
54751,Marge,"now, if maggie runs a fever, you call this number. if she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. and if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
66189,Marge,ooh!
67716,Marge,"congratulations, artie."
67293,Marge,"hello, i'd like to talk to dr. monroe."
59735,Marge,"that's no gentleman, that's my husband."
56981,Marge,homer? where are you?
58428,Marge,oh yes he is! yes he is!
54798,Marge,glow in the dark monster make-up.
57531,Marge,"homer, it's two a.m.! what happened?"
62183,Marge,as president of the cultural board i was given a key to the concert hall.
59426,Marge,"homer, you help too."
57183,Marge,call it fate. let's go...
55368,Marge,"homer, wait. herb, what're you talking about?"
61816,Marge,she is not!
65294,Marge,i listen to him.
67741,Marge,"so, what did you children learn about today?"
63065,Marge,"colonel, we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."
63873,Marge,like a big-mouthed bass.
54977,Marge,hank?! hank who?
61336,Marge,i got the roofi tickets!
62582,Marge,that's my special skill?
56337,Marge,thank goodness i drove down an ironic street.
63419,Marge,i'll just use homer's triple a card.
67296,Marge,ohhh.
61010,Marge,"i never thought i would say this, but i think we have to move."
57789,Marge,"we all need a little time to ourselves, helen. just give him a day or two and i'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
63411,Marge,"oh, my special little guy. i'm so glad you're okay."
63837,Marge,urchins!
58681,Marge,"i'll tell you when you're dead, grampa."
56002,Marge,didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
65865,Marge,it's not chinchilla. i just thought she needed more sleep.
64460,Marge,that's just what we need! but how are we going to get it home?
66936,Marge,he said he went caroling with bart.
65622,Marge,hello? rita lafleur? did you know a man named abe simpson?
66994,Marge,"ohhh, homie. i think i'm going to be sick."
64613,Marge,my smoothie is a lumpy!
60949,Marge,"honey, you did have a great time doing those commercials. and you made a lot of money."
59103,Marge,"i liked it. it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing."
62261,Marge,"this fat camp can save bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. homer, maybe you could ask mr. burns for a raise."
60089,Marge,"no housework, eh?"
59248,Marge,"excuse me, where are your hamper lids?"
62924,Marge,"don't worry lisa, i've got the answer to your problems right here."
59801,Marge,a sunset!
58514,Marge,that's me!
63358,Marge,lisa! stop reading mastheads!
66489,Marge,"thank you, moe."
66694,Marge,"okay, head count. one, two, three, where's maggie?!"
65199,Marge,gordon ramsay!
56526,Marge,"oh, i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. if someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
66703,Marge,i'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
62417,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
64699,Marge,well you can take another -- in forty years!
61018,Marge,don't you see? he's pointing out how sexist men can be.
58012,Marge,"so like i said, i've never had a tick burrow in so deep. little guy's just got a mind of his own."
63856,Marge,oh no! those were for mr. smithers' commitment ceremony!
60775,Marge,"i've gotta stop them from shooting... i, i, don't... lisa, don't hate me for this..."
55677,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't know. this might upset them."
65924,Marge,actually i'm cool with one of them.
54884,Marge,"""for heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... employee-of-the-month!"" ohh, homer!"
63981,Marge,"lisa, add another name to our christmas card list. next to our jewish friends. where is lisa?"
54818,Marge,"well... then i guess the moral is, ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
62279,Marge,a kids' barbershop? but they don't have my templates.
63416,Marge,what can i say? maggie and i share a special bond.
62478,Marge,he still thinks that hobo was a bird.
60669,Marge,"well then, who shot all the gangsters?"
61967,Marge,m631700000642j?! this is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
65824,Marge,"oh, dang it!"
64567,Marge,"homer, i can hear your sarcasm from inside the house -- and the dishwasher's on! what's going on here?"
56636,Marge,i'm not saying it won't work. i'm just saying it's dishonest.
65221,Marge,"ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?"
59404,Marge,"honey, don't get obsessed with that. focus on the good things. like this fire extinguisher i got at the fair."
64675,Marge,"homer, can we please find bart?"
65940,Marge,a high-voltage monkey prod? it is krusty's! he must have my dress. let's go!
65155,Marge,take off the 3-d glasses!
65990,Marge,you'd better be asking for something p.c.: pie or cake.
64610,Marge,homer? you have visitors.
61637,Marge,"dayton, ohio!"
67453,Marge,i think it's terrible. a man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
56404,Marge,"oh my, it looks like we're doomed!"
62049,Marge,"as long as two people love each other, i don't think god cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
55361,Marge,herb! how have you been?
57351,Marge,"it's up to you, homer. whatever you decide, that's what we'll do."
61543,Marge,"well, northern california is wine country -- we could take a tour."
66070,Marge,"is that him, getting the text?"
54740,Marge,"homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
62802,Marge,marge obedience temperance sexwon't.
55772,Marge,no.
60905,Marge,"no, no!"
66801,Marge,"homer, come here."
64041,Marge,free at last! free at last!
66226,Marge,"it's true, i never specified the home."
66132,Marge,i've been having snuggle dreams!
66306,Marge,"well, come in! i'll explain how it all works. okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
62202,Marge,"you know homer, i let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father."
58145,Marge,"oh, homer. i'm so ashamed."
62883,Marge,why are we having dinner in shelbyville?
59804,Marge,mrs. marge simpson. i'm here to teach an art class.
64483,Marge,if homer can join with me.
65684,Marge,"when you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!"
66594,Marge,the wi-fi! the wi-fi! i've got to take out the wi-fi!
58490,Marge,"well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children."
65463,Marge,there is no virus! bart faked the whole thing with a dvd! a direct-to-video dvd!
61355,Marge,we've got pretzels at home.
66928,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll just have to stretch your christmas bonus even further this year."
63666,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
67627,Marge,it was a little hard on me having him around the house
55629,Marge,"uh, they had 30 sons and 30 daughters."
63829,Marge,i thought she gave you her rebellious spirit.
66481,Marge,"i know, homie. i know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. but i also know you well enough to know that this will work."
58656,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. you got the highest grade in the class."
66868,Marge,majesty.
57253,Marge,"aw, aw, there, there, oh, maggie... there..."
61662,Marge,right here in dayton.
63845,Marge,"i already don't! homer, i've got great news!"
65080,Marge,one hundred.
59437,Marge,"homer, i'm so impressed. everything you're doing sounds so rewarding."
64088,Marge,keep going and i'll scat.
65998,Marge,that's not the way american police do things!
58650,Marge,he looks like an ordinary... ow! son of a--!
58993,Marge,a claes oldenburg. he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture.
59554,Marge,"ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. zig-zag!?"
56386,Marge,oh.
60635,Marge,"oh homer, what are we going to do?"
58343,Marge,"honey, i'd love to reassure you, but right now mommy needs a tetanus shot."
65440,Marge,"you wanna know what happens on your stupid show? firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from long beach. also, doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell, and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
54909,Marge,"now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
66683,Marge,our water was on fire.
63613,Marge,"look maggie, i'm wonder woman."
60597,Marge,look who's here. it's this thing!
57358,Marge,"homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. you're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor."
62655,Marge,"homer, i hope you get this. i'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail. hurry!"
54731,Marge,homer! homer! put a record on!
67066,Marge,i'm not sure that we can afford...
62221,Marge,you're not married to ray!
61581,Marge,pour me another.
66074,Marge,i know a place where no one in town will see us.
61187,Marge,this is a perfect opportunity. we'll beat those cavalry kids by selling candy!
58535,Marge,"young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
64550,Marge,"till the two of us are back on track, bart can fend for himself."
65916,Marge,what does this do?
60301,Marge,"well, i'm going to have a talk with them. where are their worldwide headquarters located?"
55748,Marge,"no, i just think you should talk to bart about-- good lord!"
63059,Marge,i'd give anything to hear homer's voice.
67147,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
59390,Marge,"homer, give him the fifty cents."
65403,Marge,"that's jennifer aniston's hair on ""friends."""
65632,Marge,don't take grampa's meds!
61671,Marge,"homie, people in the other elevators can see us."
65308,Marge,enough!
67309,Marge,"goodness, must be a crossed wire."
62061,Marge,so patty. you're a woman who likes women. i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded.
63723,Marge,i'm sorry i'm so emotional.
61417,Marge,what do you know? it is!
58055,Marge,friends of the library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
66339,Marge,"well, he's down to two beers in the shower..."
55667,Marge,no there isn't.
57929,Marge,but balzac is the name--
66336,Marge,thank you.
55596,Marge,don quixote.
65180,Marge,back to the car!
62899,Marge,you drink?
62030,Marge,just poke through.
58692,Marge,"i know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?"
64850,Marge,what's that?
56383,Marge,bart!
67586,Marge,"yes, dear. all you want."
60776,Marge,hey cops! check out this all-points bulletin!
61907,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
57009,Marge,"that's ridiculous. homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
55701,Marge,i'm going to see mr. lanley.
61420,Marge,what do you mean? my book is set in whaling times.
58181,Marge,"kids, i made some lemonade for you."
62337,Marge,they weren't following us.
63855,Marge,"sorry, sorry muscle spasm."
55236,Marge,"homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
65834,Marge,i want to know what it's for.
62441,Marge,"oh homie, you got chicken pox. but how?"
62090,Marge,"don't cry, sweetie. everything's gonna be all right."
60742,Marge,"oh my god, is that me?!"
54808,Marge,homer... breakfast is ready.
59364,Marge,will that really work?
56517,Marge,you could make a lot of money.
67537,Marge,this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?
63789,Marge,bart is a ten-year-old boy. he still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
65259,Marge,"annie, would you ever consider taking krusty back as a client?"
55194,Marge,"oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
62282,Marge,"sweetie, don't worry. god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced. he'd send us signs, like, i don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
66960,Marge,"bart, stop fooling around. homer, stop encouraging him."
63437,Marge,you'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of fox news.
67675,Marge,whoa--
57519,Marge,"well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. and i was sure you'd head west, because springfield slopes down that way. and then i saw the lighthouse, and i remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
62429,Marge,amen!
54929,Marge,maybe.
55955,Marge,homer?
54652,Marge,there'll never be a worse president. never.
54962,Marge,"lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
66673,Marge,"well, i do have a favor. patty and selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
67146,Marge,oh!
56266,Marge,"and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you later tonight."
59444,Marge,i guess i'll be driving.
64203,Marge,ooh! that's bart's class.
64948,Marge,"very romantic. homer had the basketball game muted the whole time. oh, and then i found a gray hair. no big deal."
60367,Marge,don't hurt me! i'm not like you people! i'm loved!
61763,Marge,i can't believe that historic rock is gone.
66394,Marge,"homer, how are we doing with those cots?"
64176,Marge,that's it! we're getting you off the meds!
61705,Marge,your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
64409,Marge,a branch must've knocked out the power lines.
57803,Marge,ned! where are you?!
56758,Marge,"my, he certainly took that well."
60082,Marge,morning!
57226,Marge,oh dear.
66572,Marge,"yes, lisa?"
65499,Marge,"helen, have a canapé! there's enough for everyone, but not too much."
67324,Marge,wheeeee!
55103,Marge,well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
56402,Marge,"oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
60902,Marge,steroids!?
57215,Marge,"ah, poor homie. poor, poor..."
63998,Marge,woo-hoo!
61203,Marge,"thank you, selma."
64024,Marge,"homie, you're barely eating."
55091,Marge,bart! what's wrong with you?
67029,Marge,"oh homer, that's ridiculous. bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?"
54649,Marge,"but steffan, i would like to get married some day."
61379,Marge,it's no! his old bike is fine!
55372,Marge,"maggie, you talked!"
63113,Marge,don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
57795,Marge,"oh, all right, let me talk to them. put me on with the lead boy."
66887,Marge,"but it's okay for you guys to know, because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information."
59307,Marge,goodbye everybody!
61876,Marge,"well, maybe not. but you did a great job on the lawn."
62828,Marge,"when i was in school, i loved math. until..."
58218,Marge,you bought four of them. thank god the check bounced.
58745,Marge,"742 evergreen terrace, springfield. oh, hiya, maude! come on in."
67228,Marge,why you big...
67134,Marge,"homer, i'm keeping the ball. for myself."
61677,Marge,"you win, kids. just sleep here tonight and we'll all go back to springfield tomorrow."
54814,Marge,it doesn't do anything.
67144,Marge,a little warm and moist.
64393,Marge,"it's fun to cook dinner together. homer and i never do it anymore. cook together, that is."
65323,Marge,"""my darling husband. this valentine's day, i have a present for you..."""
61988,Marge,of course not! i'm in bed with homer!
59093,Marge,"i know, but we didn't."
64284,Marge,ooh.
59207,Marge,"holy moly, we can't stay here. it's full of raccoons."
58889,Marge,i guess...
67189,Marge,i'm a married woman. please don't call me that.
59877,Marge,get 'em off! get 'em off!
66656,Marge,homie! our prayers have been answered!
60381,Marge,please. we went out once.
67351,Marge,"hitler, north dakota?"
63984,Marge,"lisa, i don't like this at all."
61566,Marge,"eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out."
65347,Marge,that's odd.
59039,Marge,"oh, i don't think mr. burns would like that show."
61864,Marge,you don't have to impress me by making fun of others. i already like you.
61209,Marge,no! we have to find my baby!
56388,Marge,"tortureland, explosion land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land..."
65773,Marge,just for standing on a thing?
61319,Marge,what's that?
54855,Marge,"no, that was about the budget gap. this is the trading gap."
58309,Marge,that ralph wiggum boy. he's a real winner.
55431,Marge,why? are you going?
60650,Marge,no beer!
58923,Marge,it's not fair. your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...
64108,Marge,that's not how a family vacation works. we do things together while your father has fun without us.
56150,Marge,sandwich.
66896,Marge,"i don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
61366,Marge,three!
65349,Marge,"not without us, it isn't! pull over."
62986,Marge,"bart, put that away!"
60804,Marge,if you just...
62491,Marge,a bicycle built for two! and i could be one of those two!
65411,Marge,homie! you're home early!
56870,Marge,this town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...
61000,Marge,nutty fudgkins!
56749,Marge,"oh, homie, aren't they adorable?"
57587,Marge,what are you talking about?
65917,Marge,this is not putting me in the mood!
66706,Marge,the one you booked for us at owl haven. the one you have to reserve a year in advance.
59689,Marge,"here's a headline for jay. ""ketchup truck hits hamburger stand."""
61553,Marge,i don't talk like that.
60256,Marge,so you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
60589,Marge,sure.
61078,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, mrs. lovejoy, principal skinner, duffman."
63067,Marge,"all right, but no combat."
67371,Marge,i still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
61582,Marge,"well, i feel a buzz, but i don't feel happier. it's not like when i was drinking with homer."
64225,Marge,surprise! i redecorated!
67117,Marge,"patty, he's out buying me something right now."
63772,Marge,my body wash is estée lauder...
57943,Marge,"oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
67288,Marge,"i know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along."
56668,Marge,"homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. their necks are brittle."
67172,Marge,yes.
65033,Marge,homer! homer!
63087,Marge,"look, maggie, i made another you! out of sticky orange wood!"
64458,Marge,seven-oh-seven? that's exactly the moment i was furious at you for missing our toast. and now i'm the one who has to ask... can you forgive me?
61520,Marge,"how about a little ""interrogation?"""
65336,Marge,"okay. let's ""esque"" him to dinner."
62642,Marge,that's right.
62768,Marge,"let's go home, sweetie. i'm sure there's a hamper full of homer waiting for me."
55885,Marge,"your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really ""cool."""
62062,Marge,"well, i guess i could have seen the signs."
67088,Marge,"kids, we're late for church. get your butts down here right now."
59403,Marge,"what are you doing, lisa?"
56207,Marge,and those.
55486,Marge,where'd you get all the money?
54767,Marge,to who?
65196,Marge,why?
64419,Marge,"uh-huh, and now hand me your neck..."
61661,Marge,"hi, sweetie. we're just calling to check in."
67937,Marge,"wow, moe -- you're a troll!"
63842,Marge,"here we are at school, kids."
60386,Marge,"well, i think you should get in touch with him. you know, just to congratulate him on his success."
60111,Marge,"oh, this seems like such a waste. i mean, he was charming and witty."
67260,Marge,adil?
66603,Marge,he does it to all of us.
59764,Marge,"finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder."
57072,Marge,"ahh, my teapots are ready."
61703,Marge,"stop it, homer! there's only one way to settle this -- in simpson family court."
56468,Marge,no.
61580,Marge,i am so cheesed off. i need a drink!
55627,Marge,did you girls watch the last episode of mash?
55293,Marge,"all our money's tied up in this woman. if she fails, we're broke. if she succeeds, i have no husband. i don't know what to root for."
67692,Marge,hello.
57365,Marge,"listen to me. the instant that homer's in any kind of danger, i want you to throw in this towel and stop the fight."
58914,Marge,"is it safe to eat that much food, dr. hibbert?"
58469,Marge,i don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets.
55661,Marge,"honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed."
61173,Marge,"well, thank you. i'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible pre-teen brave experience."
62388,Marge,"oh, my sweet, sweet homie! you sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
63317,Marge,wait'll i tell the other moms you gave two-thirds of your life force to save me. what a good boy.
65289,Marge,"no, we're out."
66365,Marge,"bake sale -- taken... candle snuffing -- taken... baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support -- everything's taken! all that's left is..."
67820,Marge,a hundred and twenty-five dollars!!
57498,Marge,"homer, i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
54741,Marge,"homer, i like to think that i'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. but last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
63699,Marge,i can't wait to see my valentine's day surprise!
67525,Marge,"a sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of msg."
65682,Marge,stay back! you know i'll use this... because you saw me using it.
61708,Marge,you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
59592,Marge,that's crazy.
56422,Marge,"you stay here 'til you're no longer insane. mmmm, chili would be good tonight."
60371,Marge,"this family needs a live wire, but it's just not me."
64275,Marge,her building became one of the wonders of the world.
67896,Marge,"hmmm, i notice little things about your father, too."
62591,Marge,it doesn't cover mortadella.
64615,Marge,our wedding china's ruined.
63695,Marge,homer really did need those injections.
65536,Marge,"okay, that's it! i'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! uh-oh, yes, homer."
67157,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
62782,Marge,grampa no!
64738,Marge,thank god! i will never do that again.
67450,Marge,was he rude?
66893,Marge,"if we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt homer!"
59849,Marge,you crumb-bum. you looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
67594,Marge,"hmmm, but that's michelangelo's david. it's a masterpiece!"
56543,Marge,but it's a few seconds before 12:00.
57447,Marge,the only thing i asked you to do for this party was put on clothes. and you didn't do it.
55530,Marge,"bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
57122,Marge,"homer, maybe mr. burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
55389,Marge,"oh... homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks."
56859,Marge,i don't think so.
67286,Marge,"hmmm, very... thorough."
58471,Marge,so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
61822,Marge,"you're right. if i can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week, i can do anything."
66637,Marge,take 'em!
58612,Marge,hey!
63007,Marge,"well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse."
62011,Marge,who's watching the kids?
56051,Marge,"good news, honey. two weeks are up. you don't have to wear your glasses anymore. and your scalp and posture seem fine."
64241,Marge,queen elizabeth ruled over all of england.
59133,Marge,"oh, grow up."
65906,Marge,"no! i'm tired of your broken promises! ""marge, i'm gonna lose ten pounds."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight p.m."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight a.m."" ""i'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life."" i'm done!"
55174,Marge,what? name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
58871,Marge,that's your hat!
61573,Marge,this is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.
58735,Marge,mm-hm. what about clay? you got any problem with clay?
57501,Marge,"no, homie, wait!"
59932,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share."
59083,Marge,you honor us.
55912,Marge,"homer, that isn't very nice."
66799,Marge,"well, bring him here now! i want my homie back! i miss him and the things he did!"
60218,Marge,"let's see what you have, moe."
63431,Marge,yay!
58034,Marge,"thanks for helping us out, reverend. i know you've never performed a hindu ceremony..."
65875,Marge,"well, she's just a substitute. maybe you could transfer ms. cantwell to another school."
65669,Marge,"well sweetie, if it's that important to you, i guess we can try."
66198,Marge,"come down, homie! ""you only live once"" also means when you die, you die!"
64266,Marge,"henry the fourth, part one... henry the fourth, part two..."
63378,Marge,i can testify at the trial.
55671,Marge,"doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my homie well."
66234,Marge,"well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!"
59760,Marge,squibs!
65304,Marge,"ooo, condos!"
55097,Marge,homer!
65466,Marge,"sorry sweetie, i just needed to get that out of my system."
67730,Marge,"yeah, right."
66473,Marge,"well, i was just trying to--"
66382,Marge,"kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
55583,Marge,oooh...
65526,Marge,"bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money..."
61434,Marge,the harpooned heart ii: thunder down under. chapter one. temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...
55868,Marge,mr. hutz!
65646,Marge,i always thought the pringles man had the kindest eyes.
57904,Marge,hi honey! how was your first day of school? honey?
57496,Marge,the man who lived next door until his house blew down.
65288,Marge,how can you refer to your audience that way?
64414,Marge,no... we could not.
60100,Marge,uh-huh. absolutely. / yep. /
59574,Marge,"well, nobody's perfect. let me just pick those out."
64700,Marge,you can't even show it in the bar?
60923,Marge,mm-hmm.
55495,Marge,"oh, well, isn't that... whoa!"
60440,Marge,"oh, i see you drive on the left up here."
55360,Marge,this money was a blessing. we can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
61674,Marge,"homie, the waiter's still here."
63526,Marge,you have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
60513,Marge,"homer, what are you going to do?"
58752,Marge,"your character provides the comic relief. like... ohhh... marlon brando in ""apocalypse now."""
67795,Marge,i hope we're not spoiling them.
60458,Marge,"honey, i've got some bad news for you."
63507,Marge,one hug can't hurt!
63389,Marge,homer!
54878,Marge,principal skinner!
66395,Marge,oh... i'll see what i can do.
61701,Marge,"so... pie man, why don't you show me your superpowers? pie man?"
56956,Marge,you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
59272,Marge,dancing!
65433,Marge,this is the stupidest fight ever!
60302,Marge,that's lucky.
61367,Marge,i try my best. they ridicule me. they mock everything i cherish.
64938,Marge,there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad. whoa!
60105,Marge,"ohhh... ohhh... oh, pierce, that's gooood..."
67030,Marge,shh! this bully friend of yours... is he a little on the chunky side?
67145,Marge,i don't see what he's doing that's so different from what i'm doing.
58513,Marge,that was your idea!
61374,Marge,"and the bumper stickers misspelled ""on""."
55075,Marge,"homer, that's -- ohh!"
60670,Marge,hm. time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
57907,Marge,homer!
64997,Marge,"homie, you know all the bits. maybe you could help him!"
57518,Marge,"i woke up and you weren't there, and i was so worried..."
67501,Marge,"bart, isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister?"
67835,Marge,"homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?"
59842,Marge,"oh, jack... you threw it all away, over a stupid feud with skinner."
62618,Marge,"voila! which is french for ""ta da""!"
57081,Marge,wait! wait! i don't want maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
62002,Marge,moe! no i don't love you. and i'm certainly not going to leave my husband.
65976,Marge,thank god the kids aren't here.
61916,Marge,why would homer write his name in grime?
62407,Marge,what a lousy party.
67572,Marge,mmmmmmmph!
64290,Marge,that's odd. there isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
65920,Marge,i'm glad you're okay.
58360,Marge,and the school nurse says bart has the plague.
59653,Marge,"what?! oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"
64270,Marge,"so, anyway, this is the story of maggie roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
64779,Marge,soy sauce!
66647,Marge,yesterday's whatsit? why does everyone go to them?
65614,Marge,i still feel guilty. your father's not going to be around forever.
61957,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about all of this.
54848,Marge,"here we are, kids! the watergate."
65144,Marge,"oh, homie..."
55604,Marge,"yes, but it was..."
60063,Marge,"ooh, what a handsome man!"
55364,Marge,i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel.
60554,Marge,where did you get that suit?
55555,Marge,curator of large mammals?
64579,Marge,"oh my god, homer's gone!"
65974,Marge,"oh, good. he needs his sleep."
64247,Marge,"lisa, let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband."
56687,Marge,but my new idea is different. i think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.
61546,Marge,"the doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter."
66445,Marge,"homie, there's someone here to see you."
58657,Marge,the highest grade.
62213,Marge,"okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
58859,Marge,c'mon! c'mon! get that corpse off the road! the streets are for the living!
67490,Marge,"honey, your food is getting cold."
60653,Marge,"yes, and she's crying."
57573,Marge,"""hang in there, baby."" you said it, kitty. copyright 1968? hmm. determined or not, that cat must be long dead. that's kind of a downer."
58947,Marge,"oh my. gracias, señor."
57637,Marge,but we're happy just the way we are!
58733,Marge,"oooh, how about paint-by-numbers?"
59298,Marge,broke! you broke your pencil.
58875,Marge,"c'mon, homer! jump!"
64770,Marge,no it wasn't!
66747,Marge,out now.
55074,Marge,doesn't your job start tomorrow?
59063,Marge,thirty-three cents? i paid almost double that.
56528,Marge,"homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer. i have to get off the plane. let me off the plane. i'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
54954,Marge,"all right. you got us into this, you get us out."
59520,Marge,"well, the fabric really brings out the red in your neck."
64713,Marge,lisa? are you in here?
57468,Marge,"oh, homie. i know you love me. we don't need to get married again."
62310,Marge,it's happening in ned's house! why would he allow that?
55732,Marge,you've been eating that thing for a week. i think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
55201,Marge,how shall we end it?
63612,Marge,"bye, bart! enjoy your funny books!"
55845,Marge,i bought a bell.
56162,Marge,or double-ply windows! they look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
62391,Marge,don't you have to be back at work?
55842,Marge,now remember bart. this is a religious school. so be very careful about what you say and do here.
62627,Marge,"love always... 'm'."""
66381,Marge,"shut your eyes, they're too bright."
61411,Marge,fine. right after this revision!
61629,Marge,i'm afraid this time a coat of whitewash won't cover it.
66549,Marge,"lisa. lisa, wait..."
64981,Marge,"oh hello, young man! where's your father?"
60346,Marge,that donkey is such a bad influence on you.
67810,Marge,i knew it.
62380,Marge,i've got my groove back!
66826,Marge,"well that's great, homie. just let me finish uploading this photo."
63488,Marge,"well, arthur fiedler used to, but i'd better take a look."
56987,Marge,"oh, homie..."
61541,Marge,"kids, you'd better take your last look at uncle artie."
59505,Marge,you went to the snack car?
61170,Marge,"you won't be seeing milhouse for a while. something about that boy just shakes up your soda. ooh, this looks interesting: the pre-teen braves."
67439,Marge,"see you after the game, when you're a big star."
65548,Marge,"here's your smoothie, sweetheart."
66767,Marge,"okay, remember we're parked in the ""ethnic princess"" section."
59706,Marge,"an ""a"" in astronomy. how'd you do it?"
60555,Marge,"look, i'm really starting to worry. there's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"
57036,Marge,i feel so helpless. what if something happens to them?
66458,Marge,"homie, what happened?"
61514,Marge,uh-hmm.
60917,Marge,"damn straight, i didn't sacrifice my period for second place!"
60144,Marge,"we hate her, homer."
60644,Marge,it's the man with the braces!
56997,Marge,"let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
54821,Marge,maggie!
60819,Marge,no one will ever know.
66180,Marge,like i say night after night after night: nighty-night.
55088,Marge,"maggie! you talked! can you say ""mama"" again?"
56460,Marge,i told you to watch out.
64994,Marge,"walther, when a man puts something on a frisbee, he should stand by it."
59537,Marge,but you just said that...
66001,Marge,"bart, i've never been so proud of you. never, never, never!"
60827,Marge,i'm never gonna go to paris.
64179,Marge,five more water heaters and we get a free water heater!
56505,Marge,a tasteful book.
64006,Marge,lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend.
55077,Marge,"homie, isn't he beautiful?"
62696,Marge,"okay, game over -- it's a tie!"
61692,Marge,"i'm looking up your nose, but i feel like i'm staring into your soul."
56283,Marge,"homer, i really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange."
57982,Marge,"until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. come on, kids."
61239,Marge,"homer, it's two in the morning."
60392,Marge,for the last twenty years!
65334,Marge,"""she had now come to the part that peter pan hated. 'i do like a mother's love,' said tootles..."""
58329,Marge,are you sure you'll be okay?
64194,Marge,"no, i gave that to the homeless shelter."
65191,Marge,"don't be so jealous, homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me."
67113,Marge,a little?
66807,Marge,"thank you, sven-golly. i knitted us a blanket."
64742,Marge,"homie, maybe you could do it."
59265,Marge,uh... no thanks.
59384,Marge,"no partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials..."
64701,Marge,maybe we're not going home right away.
65748,Marge,i guess you do know your weather.
61045,Marge,the box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. and why would a box lie to a person?
64278,Marge,bad baby!
60924,Marge,"bart, you're a little young to be growling at seven foot chinese ladies."
57888,Marge,i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day. i'd rather have candy.
55941,Marge,homer! are you all right?
61408,Marge,"perfect! now, let's see if lightning strikes twice!"
64572,Marge,"homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
65269,Marge,"don't open it, homie! it's a virus!"
61676,Marge,"sure, we lied. we lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!"
55409,Marge,"well, i guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her."
66392,Marge,"homie, homie, we'll be old someday."
63965,Marge,that's one of your breakup lines!
62984,Marge,stop calling her that!
59514,Marge,"you know, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
58560,Marge,"bart, i'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. your lizards are banned by federal law."
62336,Marge,let's go!
57319,Marge,"hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight!"
58600,Marge,tree!
62236,Marge,homer!
57221,Marge,"okay. maybe everything's all right. maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. if he's alive."
56101,Marge,"honey, i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldn't. you're making people happy. and that's a very hard thing to do."
63701,Marge,this is a terrible valentine's day.
63284,Marge,"fine, i'll log onto wahoo or yippy or a-o-k, or pooka-dooka, or whatever it's called."
58440,Marge,"well, let's just say the country air did us good."
60299,Marge,oh.
66347,Marge,"okay, so helen lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
65564,Marge,"well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the rx-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven."
65931,Marge,they had to! it came from corporate!
64039,Marge,it's the first day of school!
65457,Marge,woo-woo-woo-woo!
57175,Marge,"at times like this, i guess all you can do is laugh."
57536,Marge,"i-is this about that pen that i took from the post office? i-i swear i didn't know i put it in my purse. then i was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
58805,Marge,you don't know what they're saying.
61609,Marge,i'm glad i sent the kids to grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
59245,Marge,well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
56808,Marge,excuse me...
55800,Marge,lisa needs braces.
60298,Marge,"ooo, sugar free donuts."
58240,Marge,"oh no, no, no, no, no, no! they're due back at the store by six. get off 'em! get off, off! get off!"
59766,Marge,look at those exotic positions.
56778,Marge,"bart, are you ready for your history test?"
55090,Marge,"dear lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little timmy o'toole, trapped in that well."
60667,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're alive!"
57112,Marge,for what?
62739,Marge,really? you manage a whole office?
55508,Marge,"well, i'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies."
60121,Marge,"well, you can tell she's never had kids. look how high and firm her breasts are."
56367,Marge,"see kids, that's what i meant by romance."
56938,Marge,"oh, my."
67083,Marge,his name isn't bigfoot. his name is homer.
66094,Marge,i've never felt so flushed after watching public television.
55086,Marge,i bet you could have a lot of fun with this. why don't you go show your father?
54660,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, but i've got my calculus final tomorrow."
63503,Marge,"well, maybe i wanted another freezer!"
57880,Marge,bart? why are you doing that?
67511,Marge,thank you so much.
62521,Marge,so... is that standing water?
59569,Marge,"now, lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables."
64710,Marge,"we've got plenty of songs in the car, by maggie's favorite singer: roofi!"
55434,Marge,what kooky projects?
60580,Marge,"oh, it must be something big. hm. something you did?... no, something you saw."
55998,Marge,i think they want us to stop.
57964,Marge,homer. we gotta get out of here.
67106,Marge,"bart, are you all right?"
58193,Marge,let me get you a coaster for those feet.
54826,Marge,"homer, please. no one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
65410,Marge,your father must be sleeping on his side again.
56703,Marge,you don't have to do this.
65393,Marge,...so we can go inside homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
58367,Marge,"oh homer, you didn't beat city hall! they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name. period."
66832,Marge,"homer, you have to choose. and i think the choice is clear."
63767,Marge,the father of lurleen lumpkin?
65754,Marge,"homie, we made it!"
55989,Marge,"you're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?"
56256,Marge,"but, isn't that a sin?"
58610,Marge,"homer, you haven't touched your food."
58092,Marge,that's a beauty.
62158,Marge,"oh, come here!"
57137,Marge,bye bye!
66939,Marge,good bless him.
65268,Marge,"she's coming home for christmas! and bart's bringing the boys! and lisa's coming with zia! for once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!"
56569,Marge,"thank you, doctor. whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i'll think lowenstein, lowenstein."
66259,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice pushy stranger."
59798,Marge,"well, i studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
64030,Marge,i can hardly believe this is real.
55210,Marge,"children, that's not very nice."
65134,Marge,wait! i know a place you can go! a place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home.
56840,Marge,illegal gambling in my house?!
64066,Marge,it's irresistible. you ask him to do something and he does it. he's like a
61057,Marge,huh?
65261,Marge,"which means, it's the start of christmas season...which means..."
58259,Marge,"ooo, look! this is a perfect chance to get you kids some nice church shoes."
67497,Marge,"homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves."
64027,Marge,"forget it, marge. a girl like you could never land a homer simpson."
57083,Marge,"my son may not be perfect, but i know in my heart he's not a shoplifter."
57864,Marge,wow! i feel like such a nobody.
55202,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
60187,Marge,hello?
65776,Marge,"well, i must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of."
56015,Marge,"why do you read that ""free"" column, homer? they never have anything good."
62387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now."
61237,Marge,you stole this entire room from ned flanders' house!
58164,Marge,sure your dad's singing / could make your hair curl / but you too bart / have sung and danced like a girl.
64522,Marge,"""anyway, i was very proud of eliza, but my husband hiram had not quite caught abolition fever..."""
64680,Marge,you're home early!
55816,Marge,it's true. you have good coping skills.
57208,Marge,toast.
60442,Marge,"hurry up, bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog."
64921,Marge,"milhouse, i'm getting tired of waiting."
62385,Marge,but i'm not coming back yet.
57651,Marge,so?
57229,Marge,umm... how about... ghostmutt?
54765,Marge,do i have to do this?
64707,Marge,perestroika?
65286,Marge,no one's shotgun! now be quiet!
58402,Marge,"can you help him, doctor?"
65207,Marge,1501 w-- east oak street.
60479,Marge,betcha they're not! three to one. how much you got?
61793,Marge,these magazines are from before we were married. maybe you should throw them away.
62358,Marge,you are.
54670,Marge,wait nicely!
60539,Marge,that's it. from now on i'm growing all our vegetables myself.
56208,Marge,and those!
59588,Marge,be right back.
63209,Marge,weren't you listening? i just told you a whole story about revenge.
55323,Marge,"oh, oh... thank god!"
55014,Marge,"""barnacle bill's home pregnancy test""? homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
59897,Marge,"honey, i'll make it up to you in bottle rockets."
65088,Marge,"homie, you're making my toes curl. you sure know how to please a woman."
63765,Marge,...but still no sign of lurleen's dad!
57472,Marge,it's the most perfect wedding i could ever ask for. you even got a hip rock 'n' roll combo.
62613,Marge,"merry christmas, homie. i think you're really gonna like this."
60740,Marge,"manjula, remember when apu cheated on you?"
63175,Marge,"this was my favorite seahorse. i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling... oh god, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!"
66602,Marge,ta-da!
64408,Marge,what a smart way to spend a snowy day.
59663,Marge,"more wheat cakes, mr. mayor?"
63027,Marge,"uh-oh, switch!"
55249,Marge,"i'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and i found a way to stretch the food budget. fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. ham night will be spam night. and porkchop night..."
58354,Marge,"for you, homie."
59526,Marge,we need something quick. my husband's eyes are really shot.
56632,Marge,look!
60634,Marge,"this is ridiculous. you've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
60230,Marge,these new pews are so comfy.
60829,Marge,the late frank grimes...
67847,Marge,"homer, this thing with your dad has had you moping around the house for days. i think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands."
67178,Marge,"oh, jacques! it fits. you got it in my size and it has my name on it. it's really for me."
56652,Marge,"it's clever, just like you. huh? huh?"
67704,Marge,bien.
66614,Marge,"you seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
61594,Marge,he's eating my beauty!
55771,Marge,"homie, do you ever drink alone?"
67365,Marge,"homer, are you still awake?"
60441,Marge,"nice try. but we're still going to ""riverdance""."
59771,Marge,this is terrible. how will the kids get home?
63576,Marge,how was your night?
55578,Marge,"homer, mr. burns gave me another raise today."
57619,Marge,"i'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
61616,Marge,"so, how are you holdin' up?"
58924,Marge,a musical doorbell!
58140,Marge,bart! you're up early.
61656,Marge,we're ditching our kids and taking a second honeymoon!
57798,Marge,of course he did.
59777,Marge,"oh, homer, where have you been?"
65954,Marge,"all right, at least i can delete these westminster dog shows."
60914,Marge,"so then i pop my delts, clench and bam! not a dry eye in the house."
59087,Marge,lisa!
58224,Marge,i'm not leaving my home!
59216,Marge,but it's only been one night.
63200,Marge,"don't worry, they're still drunk from school!"
61948,Marge,"bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!"
57995,Marge,homer! you said you got rid of the gun. you lied to me! again!
59413,Marge,they sound angry... and africanized.
63243,Marge,"homie, you woke up early?"
62193,Marge,she's really enjoying alaska.
64042,Marge,"oh homie, the insurance bill is due today. can you make sure to mail it?"
62073,Marge,but that wouldn't happen unless...
62902,Marge,"oh, i don't..."
57873,Marge,"bart, no fireworks! put that back!"
63638,Marge,whoa! those buns are poppin' fresh!
60456,Marge,"well, we're not giving up. we're going to cure you of drinking."
55477,Marge,"honey, no one's going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant?"
66610,Marge,all you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
55575,Marge,"mr. burns, you want to see me?"
55357,Marge,"how was your day at work, dear?"
60934,Marge,that is gonna drive me nuts.
59919,Marge,squaresville sounds pretty cool.
67192,Marge,we're... uh...
61740,Marge,"if there's one way to get the truth out, it's on a cable news channel."
60944,Marge,well here's another low-rated annual event -- spring cleaning!
60190,Marge,"oh, my goodness..."
61463,Marge,"bart honey, it's a nice day. why don't you play outside?"
54679,Marge,"because we have no way of communicating with the outside world! tell me, has robert fulton invented the steamboat yet?"
59432,Marge,hello? is there anybody in there?
65977,Marge,"the suit wasn't magic, moe. don't you know the story of dumbo the elephant?"
62780,Marge,"homie, you should give your dad a call. you can't stay mad at him forever."
59692,Marge,when you get a penny from a chum / don't just buy some bubble gum! put it in your cap! put it in your cap! when you find a nickel in the snow / don't just blow it on a picture show put it in your cap / put it in your cap...
67619,Marge,"yes, i do."
57369,Marge,"homer! homer, he's not going to get tired! you've got to hit him back! hit him back!"
67838,Marge,"well, you certainly captured the moment. hmmm ."
59615,Marge,no they didn't.
56092,Marge,"homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
63189,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so worried. but if i concentrate, our love is so strong, i know i can hear your thoughts."
63407,Marge,i gave you ten dollars.
67762,Marge,saturday night? i'm not even sure my sisters will be available.
55358,Marge,hands across america...
55030,Marge,you don't have to do that.
55616,Marge,"homie, please don't go."
65939,Marge,vodka? is this krusty's?
58956,Marge,but he said it was forbidden.
58714,Marge,"homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?"
62543,Marge,i thought it was arm wrestling.
62438,Marge,"chief, don't you think you've had enough?"
65097,Marge,...and these are from sardine cans your father opened. he saved them out of sentimental value.
56564,Marge,they are?
67889,Marge,i don't think i can.
59038,Marge,"oh, how awful."
57347,Marge,"i can't believe it! i've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
58620,Marge,hmf. i think you've had too much strawberry wine.
56773,Marge,i'd be thrilled. you can start right now.
59715,Marge,what's going on?
58710,Marge,"no, of course not!"
57704,Marge,"i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. i guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, homie?"
60267,Marge,stop fighting!
58362,Marge,bart!
66016,Marge,"listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you."
57056,Marge,bart! stop pestering satan!
62639,Marge,"while the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
66352,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i'm all out. i spent all i had lighting that candle for great aunt betty."
62985,Marge,class all the way.
56476,Marge,well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
57334,Marge,move us?
60382,Marge,artie made mega-bucks with a revolutionary invention -- a converter that changes that horrible modem noise into easy-listening music.
54773,Marge,we're here!
60146,Marge,let's go.
65582,Marge,what a wonderful thought.
67380,Marge,all right. but if anything happens...
60085,Marge,the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest woman here.
58624,Marge,"uh, it's that pair of dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?"
57425,Marge,"oh, can you sing it again?"
63988,Marge,okay. one night.
58287,Marge,bart!
65036,Marge,"dr. zander, what happened?"
55096,Marge,"bart? honey, i made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
63118,Marge,"well, if no one else jumped off the empire state building, would you not jump?"
56620,Marge,there's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. just rinse it good...
65357,Marge,that was the last springfield radio station. now we just get shelbyville talk radio.
64732,Marge,"you go ahead, i'll stay here. if i get something on this handbag, i won't be able to return it."
63279,Marge,experts disagree on location of heaven?!
64844,Marge,you were given six weeks to live. and you've outlived it! i think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
59658,Marge,but you seemed so happy in the ocean. all that playful leaping.
57969,Marge,"homer, i don't want guns in my house! don't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns?"
67294,Marge,"i'm marge, thirty-four, and my problem is my husband. he doesn't listen to me. he doesn't appreciate me. i don't know how much more of this i can --"
56295,Marge,"look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?"
59836,Marge,"oh, jack. i know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
64671,Marge,"walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?"
60433,Marge,"mmmm. all this food is so frou-frou! ooo, faberge egg salad."
61138,Marge,stop saying things!
56114,Marge,their floors are sticky-mart.
63875,Marge,bullies!
56961,Marge,what's wrong lisa? didn't you get enough lamb chops?
61981,Marge,"thanks, moe."
55566,Marge,mr. burns!
62522,Marge,i think i might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
64112,Marge,i want to talk to howard.
65629,Marge,what does that mean?
56080,Marge,"you know, you're right, homer. maybe i should get some professional help."
61474,Marge,hostess twinkies?
60997,Marge,his answer's not at the bottom of a hedge.
61090,Marge,why don't you just chase the beavers away?
63571,Marge,"well i won't be home either. i'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains."
56856,Marge,go back to bed! don't make me come up there!
63768,Marge,"she's thirty-four, and she's having a rough time!"
63865,Marge,you did the right thing.
62936,Marge,"hey, that was my iced tea. i just sweetened it to my liking!"
66551,Marge,"hm. well, that makes me feel better."
67401,Marge,like what?
63686,Marge,we wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
59454,Marge,she's president of the united states.
59591,Marge,why would i do that?
58568,Marge,"oh please, lisa. everyone's already figured that out."
65753,Marge,and here comes santa's little helper!
55404,Marge,"i'll come home right away. all right, i'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken... extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait..."
59838,Marge,not until you finish your sundae.
55747,Marge,he called you a bad father.
57075,Marge,"please, bart, no more pranks. it would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
57001,Marge,con: i am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
56721,Marge,oh lisa!
57997,Marge,"now make no mistake. when i say ""first aid,"" i'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert!"
62757,Marge,i thought life preservers only came in orange. because wouldn't it be hard to see blue in the ocean?
61984,Marge,"i know, i used to think of moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. but now that i've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded."
64583,Marge,okay.
54965,Marge,"homer, be nice."
63851,Marge,well... okay.
63989,Marge,"listen lisa, i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town."
65379,Marge,i think that's enough birthday fun.
64382,Marge,"this one has an action, and this one has a body part. see?"
67455,Marge,bart!
65719,Marge,survive what?
61835,Marge,"well, i didn't come this far not to cheat."
63101,Marge,"well, homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. good job. very thorough."
58418,Marge,i'm going to bed.
54718,Marge,"oh no, he yawned -- i'm boring him!"
57636,Marge,the house is still a mess and i'm going bald from stress --
64513,Marge,"it's like when your father and i left the movie ""carrie"" right after she was crowned prom queen! she was so happy -- she'd had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her!"
65775,Marge,but we know so little about them.
57080,Marge,"oh, homie. look at that watch. i've always wanted a watch like that."
67671,Marge,i think this is sick. they're staring at a dot!
60711,Marge,"we had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
64022,Marge,"don't feel bad, homie. i married you! and you're a million times better than-- here comes vance!!!"
58637,Marge,lisa!
54626,Marge,you know what i want to be when i grow up?
67139,Marge,"no, thanks. i'm just here out of spite."
56841,Marge,i didn't mean to.
57722,Marge,"homer, that's very clever!"
58262,Marge,did you hear that kids? brown!
59250,Marge,you don't want something that overshadows the pencils.
66182,Marge,"postage, marked in pesetas? who are those letters from?"
56325,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
55550,Marge,maybe i should apply for that job.
63310,Marge,"ew, i can't watch this."
66113,Marge,"well, i was trying to buy you snack cakes..."
67256,Marge,yes! yes!
57851,Marge,"lisa, no! this place is just a jail for children."
63177,Marge,"excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. what happened?"
58936,Marge,still no visitors! it's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. what's the number for luigi's?
57172,Marge,"...i've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
63338,Marge,"now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life."
67801,Marge,"time to get up, lisa. it's a school day!"
54981,Marge,he hasn't done that since he was two.
65796,Marge,"all right. fine. if you boys want it, i'll tell you what i really think."
60814,Marge,"oh, it sure is good to be home."
64797,Marge,you see that mirror? i discovered that if i sat in the kitchen i could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
57557,Marge,uh... oh...
59259,Marge,"you know, i saw apu today. he's really frazzled."
65652,Marge,well... i like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles i could mention. passover.
62250,Marge,"doctor, you're a pediatrician!"
55038,Marge,is this it?
61081,Marge,"homie, what are you thinking?"
58038,Marge,what are you doing with that?
61861,Marge,aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
56371,Marge,oooh. recipe-related bumper cars.
67647,Marge,"well, maybe lisa's right. tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner."
57489,Marge,"dear god, this is marge simpson. if you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. so if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
59965,Marge,"ooh, you're right. and that's not his wife."
67120,Marge,the place where the waiters sing.
62427,Marge,dr. hibbert?
60719,Marge,did they ever find tom petty's toe?
58095,Marge,"so that's how you see me? as a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
62637,Marge,of course.
61068,Marge,maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
62367,Marge,i'll call you back!
61073,Marge,"lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. but it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. so i can't apologize."
58386,Marge,"homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. food. i mean, food."
63824,Marge,"homer, look what i found with your mother's things."
56249,Marge,i want this to end now!
65029,Marge,you can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
58836,Marge,i don't think you're gay. i just have to do my grocery shopping. now please gimme my keys.
55177,Marge,i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
58844,Marge,"hmm, i thought it was sandy duncan."
58473,Marge,i am!
60287,Marge,"i'm so proud of us. when we stick together, we can do anything."
65967,Marge,"so what do you say, moe? will you give me a smile?"
58459,Marge,we've gotta get home before someone sees us.
61253,Marge,"well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?"
59249,Marge,"oooh, look at all these clever pencil holders."
60109,Marge,no!
60313,Marge,"aw, hop in."
64227,Marge,we can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
55561,Marge,"we need the money, and my life is pretty boring. last week some jehovah's witnesses came to the door and i wouldn't let them leave. they snuck away when i went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
62028,Marge,"oh homie, don't worry. i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea."
61915,Marge,"chloe left town as soon as barney proposed. i would've followed her, but my plans changed when god brought me a wonderful little boy... bart, stop that!"
66032,Marge,you don't know where carl is from?
64638,Marge,homer?
62785,Marge,you've been transferred to india!?
62819,Marge,"homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
62600,Marge,it's obvious why bob is a vaunted pillar of your community.
63132,Marge,"i promise you, he'll leave after today."
62302,Marge,homer!
55603,Marge,"homer, please i just had eggs."
65867,Marge,"ned, homie's a little cranky right now. more than his eye, i think you hurt his feelings."
61404,Marge,"""chapter one: starts and beginnings."" ""swim, swim, swim, thought the whale, flapping his... floppers."" brownie break!"
67246,Marge,principal skinner!
63803,Marge,"i get it -- every title means the opposite of what it means! then i bet i'll love ""chernobyl graveyard!"""
58338,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. all your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
57030,Marge,"well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
66809,Marge,"homer, quick! get your shooing broom!"
55073,Marge,"homer, does this mean --"
59597,Marge,"shut up, becky! there. i finally said it."
59143,Marge,bart? honey?
64847,Marge,"sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. indiana jones had snakes, the grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, i'm not crazy about opossums."
66976,Marge,"you did it, homer."
60521,Marge,"i don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to brazil."
61569,Marge,i can't believe i drove drunk.
66150,Marge,what ring?
57010,Marge,a tombstone?!
66154,Marge,what are you doing?
55528,Marge,bart! stop being confident.
57535,Marge,"hello, can i help you?"
65117,Marge,"homie, it was maggie."
65845,Marge,"if you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!"
59482,Marge,just kidding. i would never do that.
63055,Marge,i think she just answers their phone...
57394,Marge,"i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble."
56817,Marge,no.
55116,Marge,bart?
63582,Marge,"all those nights i thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!"
59701,Marge,"now honey, let's turn on the news and forget our troubles."
57852,Marge,"lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, i'll be here in half a jiff."
56304,Marge,i knew i shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
61486,Marge,maggie doesn't talk yet.
62126,Marge,no more oriental mustard!
60999,Marge,not the swear jar! it's the only thing holding back the filth!
62335,Marge,"homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. but i didn't change bart's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic."
55065,Marge,homer!
54930,Marge,no.
59968,Marge,"i don't know if it matters, but it was a time magazine. does that matter?"
63336,Marge,you should all be ashamed! passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo! what have you people ever done?
65395,Marge,it's death! i recognize him from fortieth-birthday cards!
56420,Marge,this is less encouraging.
67386,Marge,homer...
55186,Marge,"yes, homer."
57563,Marge,when can i start? what's my territory?
65927,Marge,sixteen.
62340,Marge,"it wasn't a fair fight! your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting cinemax."
55710,Marge,homer? homer?
64555,Marge,"""mom and dad, bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary!"""
57826,Marge,remember me? my name is marge! / the tv mom whose hair is large!
55620,Marge,he does not.
57192,Marge,"don't worry, i saved the receipt. we'll have a $3,300 credit at chanel."
61347,Marge,"is that better? to me, ralph wiggum is sir lancelot."
62490,Marge,"uh, he's just faking loss of vitality, reverend."
64880,Marge,i've always believed in you even when others didn't. can you help save our family christmas? marge simpson.
57512,Marge,has anyone seen homer?
56617,Marge,"well, actually -"
58812,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
64510,Marge,absolutely right.
61570,Marge,i don't know what to believe anymore.
58926,Marge,"excuse me, mister... trainee, i'm trying to find a musical doorbell."
58449,Marge,"y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
62431,Marge,no!
66103,Marge,get out of my head!
67587,Marge,i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
59361,Marge,wow! he should have his foot insured by lloyds of london!
61792,Marge,playdude magazines? have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
58702,Marge,"wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! seals and crofts, pablo cruise, air supply, ohhhh, loggins and oates! and it's free!"
65720,Marge,it's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. but this is all a little... creepy.
64204,Marge,this school has really gone downhill.
63135,Marge,"wait, you don't have a place to live?"
63350,Marge,"oooh, the new issue of ""smothering mother magazine."""
58500,Marge,what happened? you didn't fall.
67806,Marge,"doctor, i think lisa has the mumps."
65881,Marge,i volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes. it's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.
59069,Marge,"c'mon, homer! japan!"
59639,Marge,"you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger. and when i heard it was for awareness, that sealed the deal."
67597,Marge,hmmm... yes and no.
63957,Marge,take my hand!
62666,Marge,"wow, it glows in the dark."
64295,Marge,"ultimate punching?! ""ultimate"" makes everything worse!"
61587,Marge,"homie, i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
57569,Marge,"well, i guess macy's and gimbel's learned to live side by side."
64653,Marge,"credenza, credenza, lowboy, sideboard, portmanteau..."
57514,Marge,your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. or a police car.
56771,Marge,ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
54641,Marge,"well, i know you'd never say anything that isn't objective..."
64990,Marge,abe? are you feeling all right?
57399,Marge,you've already used up your birthday and christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. and you hardly ever play with that anymore.
54650,Marge,it's statements like that that... are mean!
57461,Marge,fine. i'll go without you.
55082,Marge,bart! be polite.
63340,Marge,exactly.
55599,Marge,mmhmmm.
57965,Marge,"oh my god, homer! they're right next door!"
63887,Marge,"bart! where are you, bart?"
66597,Marge,and now to make my big move.
55786,Marge,but you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look.
58237,Marge,and who do you love now?
58265,Marge,"oh, yes! as long as it's tasteful... and never at someone, or with... and not..."
57550,Marge,"well, maybe it's all for the best..."
65911,Marge,he's taken a step. he's really close. all he has to do is not eat a piece before i do.
59657,Marge,"well, we're still poor, but thanks to your father, we'll never go hungry."
59855,Marge,so many restaurants...
62826,Marge,"well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper."
56417,Marge,we're just gonna have to wait and see.
63536,Marge,"dwight, use your noodle. if you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. i'll tell them you're a good guy."
66325,Marge,here's your breakfast.
67934,Marge,yes!
67773,Marge,"homer, you will find her a man."
55959,Marge,"they need our support. besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
56547,Marge,no! no!
57405,Marge,i've got rocks that need washing at home.
55167,Marge,"hello, room service? this is marge simpson. i'd like a hot fudge sundae. with whipped cream. and some chocolate chip cheesecake. and a bottle of tequila."
67399,Marge,"for a superior race, they really rub it in."
63985,Marge,stop milhousing your sister!
60769,Marge,i'm afraid all that attention is from the wrong kind of people.
59107,Marge,"oh, you poor thing..."
55938,Marge,"bart! you should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they'd rather listen to that old war of the worlds broadcast on npr, hmmm?"
57949,Marge,how horrible.
61610,Marge,principal skinner is having second thoughts? poor edna!
64908,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, because we're all getting together next week."
64765,Marge,poor man. you've been through so much.
55573,Marge,oh really? i came to see you three times today. twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
64079,Marge,you guys have treated me like a princess. every day's been like the first ten minutes of mother's day!
61121,Marge,"bart, get out of there!"
63969,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. back in high school, the boys used to call me marge ""boob""-ier."
59338,Marge,"oh, i don't want to be a bother."
57390,Marge,oh. yeah. thank you.
67602,Marge,"really, why?"
63836,Marge,this was such a pleasant st. patrick's day till the irish people showed up.
65405,Marge,uh-oh.
59581,Marge,"yes, i hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes..."
60250,Marge,"lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
56811,Marge,"homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. you'll always be the man of this house."
59682,Marge,"oh, that's too bad."
64134,Marge,i can't believe you're ruining the second thursday before the wedding!
56137,Marge,"bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?"
67552,Marge,all right.
61578,Marge,you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing?
60198,Marge,"do something, mesmerino!"
65609,Marge,maybe there's enough homer in the world for now.
62343,Marge,"what's wrong, bart? you love youth culture!"
61512,Marge,lisa! you're all right!
59255,Marge,oh. sorry. so have you two thought about kids?
63282,Marge,"well, at least it got made."
61135,Marge,how could you both miss the bus to school?
65302,Marge,someone thinks we're leaving. i'll wave them off.
58831,Marge,"no, no, as soon as i get over, that lane will stop moving. erma bombeck said so, and dave barry agrees."
59112,Marge,ew!
60850,Marge,"oh, i can't stop worrying about homer and lisa."
65712,Marge,"until then, why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences."
65577,Marge,i do!
60348,Marge,"hmm, i'd better polish those jaw wires for tomorrow."
60668,Marge,"i'm so glad this all worked out. thanks for saving my husband, chief."
58071,Marge,easement!
55218,Marge,so you think she has talent?
62325,Marge,i knew they'd try to convert you! that's what they do! well i'm not having another twelve kids.
63081,Marge,all those women are so impressive.
56081,Marge,that's true. will you forgive me?
61944,Marge,lousy drawer... potato masher stuck in small spoon slot... what kind of madman would do that?
61496,Marge,"and maggie gets a shirt, too!"
64307,Marge,"pleased to meet you, chett."
67660,Marge,because we love your father and enjoy his company.
57294,Marge,"well, did you call one of your friends?"
67747,Marge,yes. i ate two grapes. please charge me for them.
59228,Marge,i'm with lisa. let's take 'em to the cleaners.
55805,Marge,because they love you down at the plant.
64261,Marge,"no, it was homer!"
67452,Marge,"well, he's not perfect, but he is very..."
63646,Marge,"ooo, opal!"
64624,Marge,"lisa, i know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair, so i got you this book from the ""being different"" section of the bookstore."
62283,Marge,"ooh, i could be the rachel to your jacob."
64687,Marge,you know what? i'll just cook this later.
60590,Marge,is that windex?
62305,Marge,"bart, don't make fun of grad students -- they just made a terrible life choice."
57814,Marge,i only have five lobsters. are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
64000,Marge,i just said that.
60422,Marge,i really appreciate you helping me find homer.
59239,Marge,"he shouldn't have deceived me, but i'm just so relieved lenny's okay."
57827,Marge,ghost? what ghost?
60215,Marge,"homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?"
66152,Marge,"she's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
60782,Marge,"c'mon, lisa. it's time to go."
59662,Marge,"geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
58621,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, put your poncho on!"
58101,Marge,"but small. really, really small."
61143,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
61214,Marge,maggie's right in the middle of that italian-american-mexican standoff!
60219,Marge,"wow moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
66543,Marge,"fine, fine! homer! give him a party!"
66604,Marge,what's going on? are you kids eating your feelings?
58016,Marge,"homer, mr. burns can't see you winking."
65483,Marge,this car's so clean! i'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
67599,Marge,"um, i don't know. i guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't."
59772,Marge,"seems like animated shows are everywhere. or were, last year."
65573,Marge,"...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! excuse me."
55222,Marge,"oh well, you'd be surprised."
67938,Marge,who are we hiding from?
59158,Marge,major league baseball?
54776,Marge,homer!
56199,Marge,"ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
61387,Marge,"my job was to keep lisa's hope alive. but instead, she's really depressed."
58786,Marge,"of course, honey."
56538,Marge,can't talk. keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
58898,Marge,"okay, then you can take lisa to dr. hibbert's."
64983,Marge,you ate his yogurt in the car.
56759,Marge,"dogs! chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor!"
55337,Marge,"otto, i think you should get a job."
59462,Marge,your plan makes no sense.
60088,Marge,"oh, no. a salesbot!"
64172,Marge,"lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
54906,Marge,"well, look at the time. almost midnight."
65613,Marge,yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit grampa!
65874,Marge,we're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
62838,Marge,"""a highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax."" but how could i have won? i don't subscribe to this periodical."
55156,Marge,"homer, can you bring maggie out?"
60893,Marge,i'm not afraid!
56653,Marge,we have them in america. they're called bullfrogs.
61024,Marge,no.
60594,Marge,"i keep telling you. off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. but if we remind apu and manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems."
63044,Marge,look! a shooting star!
66408,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about all this hinting."
59501,Marge,"oh, no."
59126,Marge,"honey, if you don't want to take the medicine, we won't force you."
64103,Marge,maybe we should get out now.
58603,Marge,"stay there, honey. we'll come back for you."
60674,Marge,i've got a whole list of things for you to do today.
61339,Marge,this concert is oversold. it's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously!
58760,Marge,"oh, lord."
66480,Marge,"homie, i felt terrible when you said i felt ""stuck"" with you. but then, i realized: i am stuck with you. i couldn't stop loving you if i tried."
54788,Marge,now come on... you can play your little tie-up game inside. i've got some cocoa on the stove. who wants imitation marshmallows?
58378,Marge,no they didn't. you just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
55951,Marge,how'd you know he's a vampire?
66429,Marge,"okay... i see your point. we should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the van houtens."
65650,Marge,homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
57477,Marge,"well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
62607,Marge,"oh, homie, isn't venice romantic? this gondola ride was a wonderful idea."
55244,Marge,no.
66742,Marge,hello?
59116,Marge,it's true. he does.
67575,Marge,excuse me. there is! i think that it's a bad influence on children.
64998,Marge,"homer simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. help him!"
56215,Marge,"yeah. anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""periodicals,"" that's it."
59876,Marge,what? we're not ready to compete!
65362,Marge,is it iraqi journalists being murdered?
60084,Marge,"homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything."
57879,Marge,"we're not jumping, homer."
66736,Marge,"you didn't join a band to become famous like in ""almost famous."" you loved playing music with your friends. that was enough to make you happy."
56706,Marge,"homer, please pay attention. there's just one more movie."
58559,Marge,i'm sure we can work this out. he's just a child. let me talk to him.
65242,Marge,see? luckiest man in the world.
63601,Marge,fine. since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
62540,Marge,"bart, you are a wild heck-raiser. and i don't want to see you turn into that."
65752,Marge,it's like god's vacuum cleaner!
58288,Marge,i'm getting worried about lisa. she's been gone for hours.
66086,Marge,is it me or did this house just get classy?
56925,Marge,i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. that is so like me.
63062,Marge,a phone tree.
63199,Marge,"oh mon cher, i am the luckiest wife in the entire sixteenth arrondissement! let us kiss with the tongues."
61250,Marge,you were?
63045,Marge,that almost tore my head off!
62941,Marge,"well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life."
67304,Marge,"oh, homer."
56659,Marge,"i'm glad you're okay honey, but i wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
61638,Marge,it's got wright-patterson airforce base and a zipper museum! they have a zipper from every james bond!
63342,Marge,we should stop now.
67731,Marge,homer.
59449,Marge,"well, i'm gonna keep watching as long as they have shocking story twists and endless pillow talk."
66646,Marge,"now i know why homie comes here so much. no matter how sad you are inside, what you see looks worse."
66996,Marge,ohh!
66448,Marge,eu amo o brasil!
55269,Marge,"ooh! the paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
55521,Marge,and what if we don't?
64741,Marge,"sweetie, you could still go to mcgill -- the harvard of canada."
60461,Marge,last year's mvp. he sweeps up toenails at the beauty parlor.
55011,Marge,"that's good, lisa."
65799,Marge,you are invited to... a grand gesture? oooh!
55519,Marge,we're talking about bart.
62741,Marge,"that leaves ""a"" and ""b"" available for overflow. well done!"
63760,Marge,"listen, i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like, oh, i don't even remember..."
58322,Marge,"homie, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. what if you get called into combat?"
55122,Marge,"hmm, i guess so."
61511,Marge,how do we get out?
67775,Marge,he should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
61344,Marge,i bake apple pies!
62067,Marge,no surprises there.
58999,Marge,"oh, that can't be good."
58528,Marge,"while i deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?"
67424,Marge,"well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
58556,Marge,i see a foot!
56426,Marge,dad!! daaadd!! homer!!
60333,Marge,wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got together?
61424,Marge,it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
67848,Marge,"homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination."
56739,Marge,i think they're in love.
61409,Marge,"for temperance, the days passed on... as did seven of her ten children."
55703,Marge,nothing incriminating.
56836,Marge,"oh. uh, a looks nice. it's a, it's a good length for you."
61517,Marge,"honey, i know you're scared. but there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there."
56884,Marge,"bart! put that down! guns are very dangerous, and i won't have them in this house."
56112,Marge,but that's the longest.
63902,Marge,that was unforgivable. but i'm beginning to think that bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase.
66592,Marge,"dear lord, please help homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean."
58160,Marge,mm! who knew that lee marvin could do such marvelous splits?
61813,Marge,it's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind. but i think i'm up to it.
63188,Marge,my husband is out there!
61212,Marge,here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge!
63119,Marge,"lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
67160,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
56782,Marge,"homer, this is an operation!"
67129,Marge,"well, it's hard for me to judge since i've never bowled in my life."
55383,Marge,ohhh...
62083,Marge,"bart, lisa went over to janey's. quick, run inside and go potty!"
57073,Marge,"bart, what's taking so long? if you're having that problem with your zipper, i can send your father up."
59236,Marge,"oh no, not lenny. not lenny!"
64063,Marge,"oooh, hot comes out of hot... it's like i'm dreaming! thank you, ned."
66535,Marge,"it's okay. i mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. i think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized."
56278,Marge,"lisa, stop blowing my sex! i mean, stop blowing your sax. your sax. stop it."
64186,Marge,that'll be our christmas card this year!
55534,Marge,i wasn't here!
65690,Marge,fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze.
64542,Marge,you practiced all day on my birthday!
56382,Marge,"when do you show the consequences? on tv, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. but in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
59577,Marge,"that's very impressive, but i still don't... stop that!"
62144,Marge,"can't turn off the power, eh?"
62204,Marge,it's raining inside!
54756,Marge,"well, it's not that i don't love the guy. i'm always sticking up for him. it's just that he's so self-centered."
55887,Marge,look what i got. now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
62891,Marge,i really know where you're coming from.
55775,Marge,do you ever drink to escape from reality?
61039,Marge,"homie, i know you've got a lot of work to do. but this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family."
59721,Marge,"oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
54623,Marge,"homie, i got so caught up in the world of college that i forgot how important your love was. can you find it in your heart to take me back?"
58353,Marge,"happy love day, everyone!"
62241,Marge,when did i agree to that?
58608,Marge,"homer, when did you become a member of p.e.t.a.?"
54842,Marge,it certainly has enriched our lives.
67633,Marge,some string beans?
58340,Marge,"that ""mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
55003,Marge,you spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
59342,Marge,"leg? oh, oh, that. it's pretty great. how are things at home?"
56610,Marge,"i'll stay here, but i'm gonna think about products i might like to purchase."
55973,Marge,"""mrs. simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
56069,Marge,go home. you're bad luck!
67310,Marge,this is marge simpson. i'd like a babysitter for the evening.
60709,Marge,"get out of the car, homer."
66175,Marge,yolo?
65595,Marge,i can't believe we spent the whole day here.
59966,Marge,so that's where that went.
56684,Marge,"i think we should call a town meeting. if we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all."
67902,Marge,"homer, please."
60087,Marge,the gypsy said it would.
55265,Marge,"that spot says ""compact only""."
64441,Marge,you like tomato...
67270,Marge,oh... adil's a very sweet boy.
58249,Marge,oh my goodness! that was a long movie! it's time for school! let's go! let's go!
59783,Marge,oh no!
60907,Marge,"a little of this and a little of that. bulkenoids for my lats, mesomax for my delts, and estrogen blockers for that minty taste."
62960,Marge,let's go.
61921,Marge,"that's a sweet thought, homie."
66563,Marge,sometimes the language on these gets a little b-l-u-e.
64385,Marge,"dammit, why won't you touch me?"
66855,Marge,"you're welcome. and if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional."
66362,Marge,of course not. it's just duck.
56168,Marge,stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
67024,Marge,"that's better, homer. be brave. bye bye, bart. you were always my special little guy."
64466,Marge,you were what?!
59809,Marge,question?
65053,Marge,"selma, i just can't get over the new you."
54840,Marge,i thought you might want to snuggle.
55605,Marge,we pretty much went straight home.
66435,Marge,five figures!
66966,Marge,"oh, well."
60269,Marge,this family has hit rock bottom.
58826,Marge,homer?
64294,Marge,god didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
61149,Marge,maybe we should see a counselor.
56341,Marge,"yes, what did happen to her?"
63962,Marge,have fun!
66509,Marge,"cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot."
66628,Marge,what am i going to do? i'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
54919,Marge,"much better! oh good, the curtains are on fire!"
58575,Marge,"aww, somebody's in love."
67059,Marge,"lisa, i apologize to you. i was wrong. i take it all back. always be yourself. you want to be sad, honey, be sad. we'll ride it out with you. and when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. from now on, let me do the smiling for both of us."
61741,Marge,"when we explain our side of the story, the hate calls will end. i won't have to hear ""suck my such and such"" or ""hell this"" and ""bitch that..."""
60706,Marge,get in.
57853,Marge,"oh, honey... i heard you the first time."
54978,Marge,"homer, you made that up. question two: ""who is your son's hero?"""
65056,Marge,excuse me. we can't find our seats. marge and homer simpson.
55870,Marge,"i'll be fine, dear."
57256,Marge,"hello? tennessee state police? no, my son's car was not crushed in knoxville. i don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
54753,Marge,call this number if grampa falls in the bathtub.
65376,Marge,please don't say one again.
55054,Marge,"homer, i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary."
67004,Marge,but we don't have that kind of money.
63900,Marge,"dang that bart! thanks to him, i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat."
67862,Marge,clever title.
58764,Marge,"well, i guess your new name is really opening doors for you."
64553,Marge,"oh my god, homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
55688,Marge,my name is marge simpson and i have an idea. it may sound a little boring at first...
62392,Marge,homer! do something about the noise!
61814,Marge,"why thank you, billy."
65502,Marge,time for cake! let's finish this sucker up.
63932,Marge,well then she can have you all to herself!
59190,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie. a lady remington."
66548,Marge,i wouldn't say i paid someone to be your friend. i just gave her money for records and ice cream.
66973,Marge,there he is!
64452,Marge,who's there?
65528,Marge,"so, this is basically what we can afford."
57396,Marge,"ohhh! give yourself up, homie!"
57660,Marge,...pimento nose... and voila! mommy's patented happy-cracker snack platter!
63596,Marge,why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
56893,Marge,"grampa, i found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. have you seen it?"
57217,Marge,simpson! lie down!
55735,Marge,you look terrible.
58747,Marge,it's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of admiral.
55915,Marge,if you're going for a ride i'd like you to take bart and lisa.
59231,Marge,it certainly is. why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
67148,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
61725,Marge,"homie, i know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. i guess it didn't mean that much to you."
57553,Marge,now you're the one who's being naive.
65436,Marge,"why, if it isn't jimbo, dorf and ernie."
62848,Marge,now i have a question... who are you people?
59703,Marge,we have to tell them you're not dead.
57821,Marge,he doesn't hate you. he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
62217,Marge,you're drooling on my goodwill pile!
57920,Marge,and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode! uh... i'll go start dinner now.
62373,Marge,and treated like i deserve.
63470,Marge,where's bart?
59425,Marge,"glad you made it, ned."
65771,Marge,that's moe and a bag of garbage.
65392,Marge,how do you know about it?
59084,Marge,"no, no, no! we want plane tickets home to springfield."
54686,Marge,it was my fault! i... i walked into a door.
55990,Marge,no. i couldn't.
54732,Marge,children! go!
65662,Marge,maggie's a little hungry.
56140,Marge,"homer, that's not god, that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there."
63253,Marge,can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
67064,Marge,"we're just browsing, thank you."
64634,Marge,"you guys should go on that cruise. you'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father..."
62492,Marge,"homie, if i buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?"
59522,Marge,"well, we're still welcome in north dakota and arizona."
58730,Marge,i'm so happy you're going to the big game. my dream has always been to see the bolshoi ballet.
60655,Marge,"you said you'd do something, and you followed through on it."
63892,Marge,i think it's time for us to go home.
58581,Marge,"it's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure."
59797,Marge,a convict painted that?
64851,Marge,you brickyard bimbo!
58642,Marge,"oh, sweetie, you look so much better. ready to go back to school?"
65870,Marge,i wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.
60909,Marge,"not so fast, busboy!"
61951,Marge,"we're big fans, mr. gladwell."
67687,Marge,"excuse me, is this room 106?"
61034,Marge,"oh, homie. don't let it get you down. so mr. burns doesn't take you seriously? big whoop! who gives a doodle? whoopie ding dong doo!"
59731,Marge,you don't know what i'm missing.
57194,Marge,"but, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
64790,Marge,"oh homie, maybe we should call it a day."
62974,Marge,"oh, you're a widower."
59638,Marge,"oh, save it for your next book, you little snitch!"
59490,Marge,"quiet, you two! you know your father's had a breakdown."
58411,Marge,you mean frank grimes?
55757,Marge,lisa?
58102,Marge,"well, that about does it for houses in this area..."
66248,Marge,don't listen to them. they're the ding dongs.
55960,Marge,you like ballet?
62614,Marge,"i knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me."
61911,Marge,"back then, we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism."
57939,Marge,"that sounds beautiful, ned. and let me just say, my family and i share your vision for a better now!"
66735,Marge,you sound great! your licks are really... juicy.
66929,Marge,"i get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, homer."
58467,Marge,"okay, okay. here we go."
64667,Marge,the paper's here.
63124,Marge,"come on, homer, let's get the kids out of here. homer?"
62035,Marge,"all too well. rap music belongs in the rubbish bin. it encourages punching, boastfulness, and rudeness to ""ho's."""
64243,Marge,"lisa, you are going to look so pretty."
60056,Marge,"oh, we're calling it day care."
63022,Marge,that's right.
62053,Marge,"homer, you married every gay couple in town."
56117,Marge,"oh, that'll work out great. we're out of lucky charms."
61750,Marge,i don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones.
55607,Marge,we went fishing.
61527,Marge,"i don't know, artie..."
56360,Marge,"yeah, right."
64608,Marge,"hey, that's pretty nifty. let me try."
60120,Marge,i can't take it anymore!
56018,Marge,are you sure it's safe?
55714,Marge,and that was the only folly the people of springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.
58694,Marge,that's not the point. and another thing. i asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
59583,Marge,really?
62660,Marge,poor willie. would you like to spend the night with us?
63074,Marge,dear pus bag...
64686,Marge,but you can keep me company.
56566,Marge,"wait, some other stuff's coming back to me."
54973,Marge,"homer, could you turn off the tv? there's a little test i want you to take."
59035,Marge,this is so much nicer than the kwik-e-mart.
65792,Marge,homer simpson! did you take maggie to moe's?
57190,Marge,"come here, maggie."
67641,Marge,"what are you saying, homer?"
59340,Marge,"oh, i don't think i need any... oh, wow..."
57936,Marge,you're a good father.
58668,Marge,what is it with you and robots?
64978,Marge,"but be honest, when i say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"
65717,Marge,you can't have secrets from your wife!
61604,Marge,would you like to join us?
62177,Marge,don't leave now! the next piece is an atonal medley by philip glass!
60615,Marge,in the tree.
61675,Marge,would you two just shut up!!
56177,Marge,"uh, sure."
67585,Marge,it's time for krusty.
62667,Marge,i'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
63573,Marge,love ya.
57281,Marge,so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
61476,Marge,"go ride bikes for a while, huh."
61060,Marge,"well, i love you, of course. but a lot of things you do still drive me crazy."
56430,Marge,"good morning, dear."
63002,Marge,"honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
59851,Marge,"thank you, honey. they come in a squeeze bottle now."
59480,Marge,isn't it adorable? i guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film.
64885,Marge,"martha, the house looks beautiful -- it's like christmas with a childless gay couple. but it's just not the same without my family being themselves."
62661,Marge,"that's not a pan, it's a colander!"
64906,Marge,it's all yours.
56722,Marge,now throw compost on it!
63141,Marge,"he's still in need, we have to let him stay. it's what dr. king would want us to do."
65898,Marge,i'm going to take a cab.
66640,Marge,"kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the american dream."
64692,Marge,homie! i thought you were at that sports bar.
66886,Marge,it's not a takedown! and i haven't told him about it -- yet.
66343,Marge,dr. carlock is like my wednesday reset button.
55758,Marge,"aw, lisa. you tried your best."
62187,Marge,"governor, i think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers."
67784,Marge,bart!
67576,Marge,ohhh.
66469,Marge,not fake attentive. real attentive.
63925,Marge,"homer, that was rude and shortsighted. patty and selma have the map."
64223,Marge,a key to your apartment!
63603,Marge,"why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? so i put pineapple in my potato salad. live a little, huh!"
62644,Marge,my yard sale is a failure. i guess i'll have to give everything to the salvation army.
65327,Marge,"it's okay, homie. go. have a good time. take bart with you!"
65628,Marge,but i thought you still loved him.
58577,Marge,here comes the flying saucer!
63427,Marge,we're gonna make it!
55267,Marge,"well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and i will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. hmm?"
65148,Marge,"patty and selma?! who's next, ned flanders?"
57044,Marge,sweet dreams.
59436,Marge,"oh, yes. the whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. ned flanders is green with envy."
59212,Marge,"it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
64683,Marge,still wanna be at moe's?
65889,Marge,it's as yummy as your poorly-produced local commercial said.
60002,Marge,"it's a healthy cereal from europe: ""meus-lix."""
59353,Marge,"well, it all sounds lovely, but..."
58906,Marge,mmm.
60222,Marge,"oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
57431,Marge,is it really necessary to watch tv while we're eating? we're getting food all over.
67636,Marge,sure.
59486,Marge,"well, maybe you added it wrong. let me add it..."
57747,Marge,"oh, maggie, you got oatmeal all over. homer, would you clean her off?"
61567,Marge,are we home yet?
60076,Marge,would you like to come sightseeing with us?
58253,Marge,"internet, eh?"
60129,Marge,don't be mad at homer. i was the one who cut the rope.
60795,Marge,squiggy?
67354,Marge,"homie, my sisters are here."
60869,Marge,no! it'll tangle!
67118,Marge,i'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
64183,Marge,i can't wait to tell everyone!
60312,Marge,i'm not sure i can afford a fancy lawyer.
63879,Marge,"honey, keeping track of someone because you love them is not wrong."
56673,Marge,what's going on in here?
67058,Marge,"ah, that's my girl."
66751,Marge,okay then!
62493,Marge,i'll take it! i can't believe i own a tandem bike!
67837,Marge,aww.
61599,Marge,my baby boy is in jail! i'm the worst mom in the world.
63042,Marge,"as for you, young man: the next time you save your principal, try not to risk your own life."
61501,Marge,you were purposely teaching her the wrong word!
55946,Marge,well... homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
55207,Marge,you hit so many home runs this year. what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you?
67458,Marge,you brought food...
60178,Marge,look at that absorbativity! i've gotta tell someone...
54863,Marge,"that's the problem. even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the tv instead of getting some much-needed exercise. those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
58534,Marge,"oh, yes. and punish lisa for lying to us."
56113,Marge,"apu, you've been so helpful. if it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the monstromart."
60132,Marge,"no, i won't. and frankly, judge, i think you're a bully."
63721,Marge,i think he's been sneakering on his diet.
67831,Marge,"homer, what are you saying?"
60577,Marge,okay.
65674,Marge,and what's with the scarf? it's soaked in neck sweat.
67529,Marge,so television's responsible.
55886,Marge,no one bought a wishbone necklace.
55345,Marge,hmmm... hostage negotiations.
66688,Marge,my sandwich!
65945,Marge,"oh sweetie, it's not for me. i wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding."
59648,Marge,poor homie. i still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you.
64913,Marge,"fine, i'll do it!"
61256,Marge,which means someone lost it. you'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it.
56477,Marge,"will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
58944,Marge,"okay, okay! let me just get the wire cutters."
65980,Marge,let me guess... you need a field trip mom?
60546,Marge,i'm sleeping on the couch.
64219,Marge,we don't need a bed. we're not gonna be sleeping.
60404,Marge,"wow! homer, that was amazing."
54934,Marge,"look homer, lisa's taking her first steps."
63702,Marge,romeo and juliet? arthur and guinevere? brangelina?
55462,Marge,"homer, you're crazy. tell him this is all crazy."
67284,Marge,mmm-hmm.
63896,Marge,"hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger."
63531,Marge,that old man over there isn't even making a transaction. he just wants someone to talk to!
54859,Marge,"oh, homer."
63819,Marge,i'd stay away from poodles. they give the dog... ideas.
60125,Marge,i don't want him to see us expressing our love.
62412,Marge,what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? hm?
57168,Marge,"oh, that would be a dream come true. i'll be there with bells on!"
55692,Marge,but main street's still all cracked and broken.
59951,Marge,springfield baby-proofing?
59138,Marge,and then afterwards...
59407,Marge,"lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."
54730,Marge,do we have enough glasses?
67035,Marge,good. then here are some cupcakes.
58110,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're okay. and i have something to tell you..."
59931,Marge,there's still more meatloaf.
62972,Marge,"on the surface, that sounds perfectly pleasant."
57665,Marge,he prefers the company of men!
66869,Marge,"well, not all of them. like, um, ninety percent?"
55891,Marge,"lisa, you got a letter."
67237,Marge,"well, i think you should take bart to meet this exotic belly-person. i want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. i want bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
56970,Marge,homer! where did you get that?
62143,Marge,i know another place you can go -- to sleep!
61241,Marge,i really shouldn't be here -- i have a problem with games of chance. i played candyland with maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
59284,Marge,all it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease.
61645,Marge,"opinion noted. now if you don't mind, your father and i are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy."
66432,Marge,"luann, i hope we're still on thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops."
59668,Marge,"i don't know why, but i just didn't feel comfortable until i was back here in new springfield, with my own kind."
58207,Marge,homer!!
55791,Marge,"are you sure, doctor?"
58468,Marge,"oh, it would have to be camera day."
65389,Marge,that's just not doing it for me.
66717,Marge,is that tea... adulterated?
60665,Marge,"but you're just perpetuating a negative italian-american stereotype. i mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did i say pizza man?"
56834,Marge,"you don't have to call me ""officer."" i'm not on duty here."
61240,Marge,"okay, homie. if it makes you feel better, i think your mom's all right, too."
60240,Marge,you're gonna get a bath tonight.
67499,Marge,bart? you're home!
58758,Marge,and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
67742,Marge,bart!
58115,Marge,"still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck."
66164,Marge,lumbar! it means lower back. how many times will you make that mistake?
65963,Marge,maybe i should come too.
61670,Marge,step on it!
57783,Marge,that's ridiculous. nobody is watching us right now.
65938,Marge,where is it? my wedding dress!
63307,Marge,i played a day and a night!
67262,Marge,"well, now that that's settled, i'll just clear the dishes."
63709,Marge,"no, i'm kind of embarrassed about it."
66181,Marge,"i can't believe i'm saying this, but i'm starting to regret saying yolo."
62170,Marge,why do you come to these meetings?
59180,Marge,homer! stop that!
66361,Marge,"bart, if this is what i think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
59171,Marge,please be a dog.
56733,Marge,"excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog..."
56502,Marge,no!
65542,Marge,looks like the red light's on.
67706,Marge,"tres bien. well, i should probably be going. i have a big forensics meet tomorrow."
59835,Marge,farm couple?!
58472,Marge,"all those eyes, just leering and leering at us."
57261,Marge,"wait -- if i remember my heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter."
59494,Marge,this is terrible. the whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
65822,Marge,"homer, that's for children!"
57673,Marge,"oh, geez louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. john's a witty, urbane person."
54870,Marge,"bart, your father and i don't want you doing that. homer, say something."
59869,Marge,"will you get serious, homer? i'd like to win at least once."
59002,Marge,"well, they're in the business. real people might not be so understanding."
64888,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
57414,Marge,"is that so? well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
62586,Marge,i'll really miss you guys. i'll never forget the three activities we did together.
65598,Marge,it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
66880,Marge,both.
64296,Marge,"otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?"
65069,Marge,"well, you married someone whose first name is ""fat""!"
63063,Marge,"hello, helen? i'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. well, i have a little plan to fix their wagon."
65384,Marge,why? are you going to do the laundry?
63593,Marge,i told you not to mock me at picnics.
67591,Marge,sure.
62238,Marge,i called that bosom bar. the bartender said you were there alone.
57162,Marge,"didn't everybody have a wonderful time? i thought it was so opulent -- like the playboy mansion, but non-sexual."
63863,Marge,whose phone is this?
56243,Marge,"mm-hmm. i'm happy about that. but, i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
57426,Marge,"well, i also have a song to sing!"
60697,Marge,"""dear homie, had to buy diapers for maggie. love, marge."""
64346,Marge,"what is it, moe?"
65941,Marge,i don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
59933,Marge,"i don't do things that way, lisa."
63035,Marge,"you're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself, 'cause i quit... and i'm taking this with me!"
61976,Marge,"well... as fabulous as your regulars are, a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush."
63211,Marge,this alley looks dangerous. i'd better turn my ring around.
55047,Marge,what about bart?
63281,Marge,"say, rainier, you're in show business. would you mind taking a look at this screenplay i wrote?"
65816,Marge,have you seen lisa and maggie?
64438,Marge,and i even got rainbow sprinkles!
64892,Marge,"dear lord, watch over my sweet homie while he's in the hoosegow."
58774,Marge,you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
61804,Marge,i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
66697,Marge,"it is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
64726,Marge,"hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
59292,Marge,"you know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing."
62043,Marge,"ooh, what a horrible thing to say to a mother."
63435,Marge,where's the hammer?!
64405,Marge,you said you were at a parenting class!
67941,Marge,"bart, are you drinking?!"
55257,Marge,not now.
57487,Marge,this down here in the first place!
55617,Marge,"ohh, now homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something."
66894,Marge,"god's plan?! god isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! god isn't sky police. god didn't do this. i lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! we did this."
57513,Marge,"no beer, huh? i guess i know what a promise from homer j. simpson is worth."
59773,Marge,homer!
64132,Marge,"all right, people, i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation."
56835,Marge,whoa!
54702,Marge,we've got a winning hand. we can take the rest of the tricks!
63816,Marge,shelter?
60195,Marge,barney? w-w-where's chad--
64866,Marge,"wrong holiday, stupid!"
57671,Marge,"homer, at least come out and say hello."
67421,Marge,homer... homer... make them stop.
63943,Marge,uh... the same thing you're doing here.
61329,Marge,"look, maggie. a show for babies."
59579,Marge,"yes. well, i guess i'll go roll socks. it's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done."
63127,Marge,we'll give you a ride.
59077,Marge,maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
61769,Marge,"homer, i am so mad at you! i'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
62890,Marge,me too. i can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.
67110,Marge,"why, bart, why?"
65368,Marge,"don't even bother shooting us. we've found a new place that we love. a place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more..."
54672,Marge,"i feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. plus, i'm dead."
64045,Marge,i don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
55860,Marge,"and a bottle of aspirin, please."
62370,Marge,exactly!
60916,Marge,"starting tomorrow, i'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel..."
65647,Marge,are you doing an app behind my back?
66053,Marge,"selma, cheating is a sin. as much a sin as not replying to an instant message. so, if you'll excuse me, i've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!"
66950,Marge,"hello again, principal skinner."
67832,Marge,"no, i'm afraid i agree with your father."
64586,Marge,and just what might that be?
59857,Marge,"oh, look at you two. you look so ""couple-y."""
58149,Marge,but mr. trebek --
67887,Marge,don't you listen to him. he's just a mean little s.o.b.
54938,Marge,"homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. if you keep spending time with lisa, she'll forgive you."
60830,Marge,and the state of florida.
63207,Marge,"you spent so much time plotting your revenge, you lost everything that really mattered. come on, kids."
63123,Marge,"lisa's sleeping over at janey's. apparently, her mom makes good mac and cheese."
67313,Marge,precious? i think i hear the doorbell.
62127,Marge,"can you help me unload this soup from the car? there was a sale, so i bought four hundred cans."
65412,Marge,"well, we're having brunch with my sisters..."
58829,Marge,"oh, homie. oh, they're beautiful."
66642,Marge,how could they open another franchise so close to me?
62691,Marge,"ned, that's so generous. but there must be something i could do in return."
65128,Marge,i don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
58983,Marge,that's my life you're describing.
60259,Marge,yes! merry christmas to us all.
55318,Marge,"go ahead, patty."
65464,Marge,"excuse me, cruise director priddis. my son has something to tell you."
60942,Marge,"see, i don't know that he is. in the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt."
65588,Marge,"no, s'okay. we can share this with you... homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
63801,Marge,"ooo, ""regularsville."" sounds like my kind of place!"
67167,Marge,"yes, very."
65345,Marge,homie! what if that was the last thing you ever said?
56967,Marge,"please pass your father the syrup, lisa."
54760,Marge,"homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? i can't believe your selfishness. you can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. you're thinking about fishing, even when i'm talking... right now. right?"
55944,Marge,"wait! before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
56121,Marge,hm. i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
61398,Marge,i'm writing a novel!
63920,Marge,of course we were.
61617,Marge,"oh, passion's for teens and immigrants. i'm just glad to have someone to look at when i wake up in the morning."
57156,Marge,we're not poor.
66904,Marge,"sorry, excuse us. pardon me..."
57188,Marge,we can't drive this up there. they'll see the dent. they'll see the coat hanger antenna. stop the car. we're walking.
61975,Marge,"maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a ""dive."""
66933,Marge,"well, sure, okay..."
65214,Marge,"foodies, help me! my husband's in danger!"
66758,Marge,"well, with all that you folks have experienced, i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom."
63383,Marge,i just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
58785,Marge,"sweet dreams, honey."
67222,Marge,"oh, bart. excuse me, sir. the party next door seems to be a little raucous. could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please?"
61358,Marge,"to overturn these horrible anti-family laws, we've prepared the ""families come first"" initiative. now, the first thing we're gonna need is money."
60465,Marge,but you were very open with your feelings.
63609,Marge,our anniversary!
63874,Marge,"okay, bart went to the comic book store."
58827,Marge,what in the world?
64704,Marge,did you really think i'd forget? now have a great time!
66519,Marge,not the van houtens.
59400,Marge,hmm. should the simpsons get a horse?
62957,Marge,"tabitha, what a coincidence -- i was just thinking sad thoughts about you!"
56179,Marge,no it's not.
57151,Marge,"ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
58225,Marge,"when we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over."
62475,Marge,"well, the important thing is we're a family again."
55478,Marge,he sold his ride on the duff blimp.
58068,Marge,"what in the heck is a ""dwelling""?"
60802,Marge,twenty-three skidoo!
54939,Marge,we can't afford to buy a pony.
54990,Marge,"so, mr. hutz, does my husband have a case?"
57337,Marge,"we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library cards... bart's lawyer is here."
60961,Marge,he should have done that with the real bart when he had the chance.
60616,Marge,"oh, i can't wait to see my surprise!"
55341,Marge,"well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
57685,Marge,ho-mer.
61775,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
67918,Marge,"hello, krusty."
65234,Marge,i'm going to bed.
54876,Marge,"homer, what did you find out?"
