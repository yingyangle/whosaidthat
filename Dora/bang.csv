Speaker,Line
Amy,"O’er the land of the free, and the home of the… Next."
Amy,"That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?"
Amy,"That’s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!"
Amy,"Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true."
Amy,Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.
Amy,"If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year."
Amy,"I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
Amy,"Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
Amy,"Tepid water, please."
Amy,Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
Amy,But the light indicates…
Amy,Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
Amy,Are you a homosexual?
Amy,Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
Amy,"No, thank you."
Amy,No.
Amy,That’s an amusing factoid.
Amy,Is this true?
Amy,"Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?"
Amy,Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
Amy,"This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
Amy,Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
Amy,Then 128.
Amy,"In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?"
Amy,Defend.
Amy,Correct. My turn.
Amy,Tuned bayonets.
Amy,Isn’t it obvious?
Amy,We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
Amy,"In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?"
Amy,Is he always like this when he loses?
Amy,Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
Amy,"Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding."
Amy,Hello.
Amy,I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
Amy,"Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time."
Amy,Shamy?
Amy,Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.
Amy,"Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that."
Amy,"Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?"
Amy,Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
Amy,"You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat."
Amy,I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
Amy,I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
Amy,"It’s very impressive, for theoretical work."
Amy,"I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute."
Amy,I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
Amy,"Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours."
Amy,"Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
Amy,We appear to have reached an impasse.
Amy,Seconded.
Amy,"Good day, Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,"Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious."
Amy,Excellent point.
Amy,Touche.
Amy,I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
Amy,Sixty-five.
Amy,I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
Amy,I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.
Amy,Next!
Amy,Next!
Amy,"From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation."
Amy,I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
Amy,"That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example."
Amy,That was rude.
Amy,Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
Amy,Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
Amy,Wait. I have a request.
Amy,I’d like you to meet my mother.
Amy,Certainly. Good night.
Amy,All right. 
Amy,Sheldon?
Amy,I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
Amy,In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.
Amy,Precisely.
Amy,Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
Amy,I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
Amy,"Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me."
Amy,"Good night, Sheldon."
Amy,"You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well."
Amy,"Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
Amy,"Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all."
Amy,See? It’s working.
Amy,Girls’ night? What does that entail?
Amy,I’m a girl.
Amy,No need. Penny and I are very close.
Amy,"Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night."
Amy,I’m a girl.
Amy,"Yes, but they’re not girls. I’m a girl."
Amy,What’s the dress code?
Amy,All right. I’ll have to go shopping.
Amy,"So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix."
Amy,Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
Amy,A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.
Amy,"Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don’t."
Amy,"Oh, good, a slumber party! We’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!"
Amy,"Well, that’s disappointing. I’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party."
Amy,"Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun."
Amy,Pillow fight!
Amy,My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
Amy,"I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare."
Amy,"Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?"
Amy,All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
Amy,"Remember, you have to answer honestly."
Amy,Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?
Amy,"And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”"
Amy,Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
Amy,"You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it."
Amy,"Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company."
Amy,I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
Amy,"Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?"
Amy,"Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?"
Amy,"Well, I’m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won."
Amy,"Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity."
Amy,"Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism."
Amy,Penny?
Amy,Don’t worry. I’ll avoid the nether yea.
Amy,"Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?"
Amy,Hoo.
Amy,I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
Amy,Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
Amy,Hoo.
Amy,"I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo."
Amy,It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.
Amy,"It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine."
Amy,"Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon."
Amy,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature."
Amy,"No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour."
Amy,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
Amy,"Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing."
Amy,Ears and genitalia.
Amy,"I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo."
Amy,Zack.
Amy,Ask what?
Amy,Zack.
Amy,Hoo.
Amy,Why do you keep saying Zack?
Amy,I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
Amy,There was no question. I simply said hoo.
Amy,Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
Amy,My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
Amy,"Sheldon, I am not going through menopause."
Amy,"I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack."
Amy,"Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal."
Amy,Religion?
Amy,No.
Amy,Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
Amy,What are you doing?
Amy,Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
Amy,And?
Amy,"You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
Amy,"That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
Amy,I’m sure it’ll wash off.
Amy,There’s Zack.
Amy,"It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend."
Amy,"Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs."
Amy,"On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack."
Amy,As am I. 
Amy,An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
Amy,"Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?"
Amy,That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
Amy,"Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity."
Amy,Don’t you read my blog?
Amy,Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
Amy,Please don’t touch my breasts.
Amy,All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
Amy,That does seem to be a valid principle.
Amy,I don’t believe there’s any such thing.
Amy,"Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded."
Amy,"No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well."
Amy,"Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate."
Amy,Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
Amy,Are you in the lanthanoid series?
Amy,I missed you.
Amy,"So, girl talk?"
Amy,Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
Amy,Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
Amy,"Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance."
Amy,We have time now. Think about it.
Amy,Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
Amy,"Of course, we’re best friends."
Amy,"Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine."
Amy,Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Amy,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
Amy,Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?
Amy,Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
Amy,Not even when I do this? 
Amy,"Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
Amy,"If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
Amy,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
Amy,"All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?"
Amy,"Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage."
Amy,Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
Amy,"Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race."
Amy,"I’m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?"
Amy,"Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter."
Amy,"And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh."
Amy,"Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department."
Amy,"Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts."
Amy,"Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies."
Amy,I came as quickly as I could.
Amy,"To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart."
Amy,"You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch."
Amy,"In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr."
Amy,Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
Amy,"Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows."
Amy,"This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?"
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Amy,"So, how you holding up?"
Amy,"Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking."
Amy,I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
Amy,I just wanted to check in on you.
Amy,"It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger."
Amy,"It’s okay, it’s okay."
Amy,"Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours."
Amy,"So, you feeling better?"
Amy,"Sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset."
Amy,Wise.
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Amy,"Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose."
Amy,"Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin."
Amy,Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
Amy,"Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes."
Amy,I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun person I know.
Amy,"Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood."
Amy,So needy.
Amy,"Yo, P-dog."
Amy,"Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully."
Amy,Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
Amy,"She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart."
Amy,You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
Amy,"Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh."
Amy,"That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant."
Amy,What’s that like?
Amy,"You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
Amy,You should get one.
Amy,It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
Amy,"Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?"
Amy,"Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard."
Amy,I think you’re on.
Amy,"Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please."
Amy,I’m drunk.
Amy,"This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?"
Amy,"Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA."
Amy,"Believe me, it’s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I’ll show you."
Amy,"Well, well, well. Look who it is."
Amy,Because I do that now.
Amy,"Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?"
Amy,"I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly."
Amy,"Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette."
Amy,"Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups."
Amy,"What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?"
Amy,Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
Amy,Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
Amy,Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
Amy,Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
Amy,By all means.
Amy,I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
Amy,It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
Amy,Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
Amy,I should think so. That’s gold.
Amy,Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
Amy,We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
Amy,"Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology."
Amy,"Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go."
Amy,Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
Amy,"Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet."
Amy,Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
Amy,No. Happy accident.
Amy,I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
Amy,Pun intended?
Amy,"Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective."
Amy,I wonder what changed her mind.
Amy,As good an explanation as any.
Amy,"Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word."
Amy,Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
Amy,"Fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
Amy,Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
Amy,I need some context.
Amy,"And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy."
Amy,You smell like baby powder.
Amy,"Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler."
Amy,I’m available for experimentation.
Amy,"Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie ."
Amy,Really?
Amy,"How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?"
Amy,My burps taste like cranberry juice.
Amy,Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
Amy,I have yoo-hoo.
Amy,Make yourself comfortable.
Amy,"Oh, that’s just Ricky."
Amy,Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
Amy,I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
Amy,A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
Amy,Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
Amy,Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
Amy,And you want me to kill her? Done.
Amy,I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
Amy,Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
Amy,What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
Amy,"You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
Amy,"Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. "
Amy,I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
Amy,It most assuredly is not.
Amy,Yes. I also found a Korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
Amy,Sheldon?
Amy,Okay. Don’t really know where we go from here.
Amy,Terrific. Thank you.  They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
Amy,"I must say, Penny, this is great fun."
Amy,"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect."
Amy,Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
Amy,"You okay in there, bestie?"
Amy,"The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
Amy,She always this crabby when she urinates?
Amy,And I’ll be right by your side.
Amy,"No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty."
Amy,Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
Amy,Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.
Amy,"Oh, no. You have to go."
Amy,"You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage."
Amy,"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights."
Amy,Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
Amy,How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
Amy,"Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team."
Amy,"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
Amy,"Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes."
Amy,Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
Amy,Look.
Amy,"Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend."
Amy,"So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
Amy,"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away."
Amy,I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
Amy,Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
Amy,Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”
Amy,I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.
Amy,I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
Amy,"She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what."
Amy,How do you want to handle it?
Amy,Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
Amy,I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
Amy,"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
Amy,"Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?"
Amy,"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?"
Amy,Just change the subject.
Amy,What astronaut story?
Amy,I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.
Amy,Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
Amy,"It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology."
Amy,"I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?"
Amy,Have you considered massage?
Amy,I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
Amy,"Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
Amy,"Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so."
Amy,You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
Amy,Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
Amy,Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
Amy,That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.
Amy,Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
Amy,"Well, I heard who you did."
Amy,Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
Amy,"She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
Amy,"She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy."
Amy,"You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
Amy,Where are we going?
Amy,Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
Amy,"We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op."
Amy,Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
Amy,"No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."
Amy,"Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn."
Amy,"Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
Amy,"No, I can’t let you do that."
Amy,"For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
Amy,A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
Amy,I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
Amy,"No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
Amy,"Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
Amy,Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
Amy,"Denial. Denial, denial. Come in."
Amy,Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
Amy,How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
Amy,"Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?"
Amy,"Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on."
Amy,"For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
Amy,"Yes, I am."
Amy,"Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate."
Amy,Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
Amy,Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
Amy,Will you listen to me play my harp now?
Amy,I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
Amy,Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
Amy,I just have one question about the chair.
Amy,Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
Amy,"No, he didn’t."
Amy,"Yes, he did. He absolutely did."
Amy,It is?
Amy,"No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me."
Amy,"No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!"
Amy,Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
Amy,"No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
Amy,I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
Amy,"Not really, no."
Amy,"Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary."
Amy,Yo.
Amy,"Oh, sure."
Amy,"I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable."
Amy,Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
Amy,"Well, most recently my gynaecologist."
Amy,"I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
Amy,How was your shower?
Amy,"Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
Amy,"Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork."
Amy,"If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
Amy,"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."
Amy,"Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime."
Amy,Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
Amy,"I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time."
Amy,"Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change."
Amy,"Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?"
Amy,Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
Amy,I got you this to give to me.
Amy,"I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
Amy,"When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
Amy,Would you like to dance?
Amy,"You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
Amy,"Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
Amy,"Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
Amy,"I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
Amy,You have any evidence to support that statement?
Amy,Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
Amy,"We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields."
Amy,"Don’t worry, I’ll lead. "
Amy,Howard?
Amy,"There we go, last floor."
Amy,The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
Amy,You’re welcome.
Amy,"I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
Amy,"And again, you’re welcome."
Amy,"No, thanks. I’m gonna head home."
Amy,Good night. 
Amy,Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
Amy,Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
Amy,"The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore."
Amy,"No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
Amy,"Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running."
Amy,"No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does."
Amy,"Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions."
Amy,"Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!"
Amy,"Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?"
Amy,I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?
Amy,Mortal enemy?
Amy,"Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
Amy,A floppy disk?
Amy,How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
Amy,You’re kidding.
Amy,It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
Amy,He’s great.
Amy,Are you getting sick?
Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?"
Amy,Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
Amy,"Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
Amy,"Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?"
Amy,"Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems."
Amy,"Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
Amy,"Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids."
Amy,"Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
Amy,Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
Amy,Wait for moi.
Amy,"Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
Amy,Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Amy,"It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
Amy,"The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week."
Amy,"I don’t know, four or five years."
Amy,They’re out shopping right now?
Amy,Just the two of them?
Amy,"That’s cool, that’s cool."
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Amy,I wanted to be alone.
Amy,"Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
Amy,It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.
Amy,Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind."
Amy,"At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
Amy,Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
Amy,"How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
Amy,We cuddle. Final offer.
Amy,"I’m just saying, second base is right there."
Amy,"Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
Amy,What are you doing here?
Amy,"That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
Amy,It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
Amy,"Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again."
Amy,You don’t get it. Look at this brain.
Amy,"This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
Amy,"Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard."
Amy,"Hey, Cuddles."
Amy,"Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad."
Amy,"Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
Amy,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
Amy,"Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base."
Amy,"I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
Amy,What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
Amy,"When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want."
Amy,"What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died."
Amy,"Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening."
Amy,"I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?"
Amy,Really?
Amy,Yay!
Amy,"Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
Amy,"I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
Amy,So no. And action.
Amy,"What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
Amy,You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
Amy,You do.
Amy,"Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful."
Amy,"Come on, bestie, you’re up."
Amy,What is taking you so long? 
Amy,"– Sorry, sorry. "
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,"Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
Amy,"Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
Amy,"Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman."
Amy,Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
Amy,"If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical."
Amy,"I’m sorry, Sheldon."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o."
Amy,A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
Amy,I had half a glass.
Amy,Or we play Travel Twister.
Amy,"Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it."
Amy,I think a boy likes me.
Amy,"I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot."
Amy,"No, I’m having a nice time."
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Amy,"I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
Amy,Anything else?
Amy,I’m listening.
Amy,Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
Amy,"Hi, Stuart."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
Amy,"Um, good night, Stuart."
Amy,How did you get into my apartment?
Amy,What’s that?
Amy,It’s so romantic.
Amy,"Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive."
Amy,"Penny, I said right hand red."
Amy,"Bernadette, left foot yellow."
Amy,That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!
Amy,What do you want me to do about it?
Amy,I should’ve gotten a lawyer.
Amy,"When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
Amy,"That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler."
Amy,"Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
Amy,Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
Amy,Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
Amy,Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
Amy,"I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
Amy,Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
Amy,I never doubted you.
Amy,"There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor."
Amy,How about donating some of your clothes?
Amy,"I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable."
Amy,"You were right, a whole new load."
Amy,"Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size."
Amy,"What is it, the fuzz?"
Amy,"I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette."
Amy,"Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night."
Amy,How was your day?
Amy,Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
Amy,"That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
Amy,Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.
Amy,Hey.
Amy,What’s he doing here?
Amy,"Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last."
Amy,We both know that’s your koala face.
Amy,"Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
Amy,"Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!"
Amy,"Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
Amy,Ooh!
Amy,Ooh!
Amy,How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
Amy,No.
Amy,"You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
Amy,Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.
Amy,"Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
Amy,Come on.
Amy,"If he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
Amy,"Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head."
Amy,How do you know? Are you a doctor?
Amy,With a dead man.
Amy,Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
Amy,"Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship."
Amy,Ooh!
Amy,"If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
Amy,"Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure."
Amy,Penny?
Amy,Penny?
Amy,"Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?"
Amy,Cool. I think I just learned something.
Amy,I’ll say.
Amy,Sweet!
Amy,I’m surrendering to fun.
Amy,You okay?
Amy,"Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?"
Amy,It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
Amy,"For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London."
Amy,What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
Amy,"Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth."
Amy,Und ich bin eine pretzel!
Amy,Mit…
Amy,I saved you a dumpling.
Amy,"I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s."
Amy,"This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day."
Amy,They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
Amy,"Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it."
Amy,"You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  You would fetch a unicorn."
Amy,I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell."
Amy,"Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
Amy,"No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
Amy,"Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology."
Amy,Soap spots. Wash ’em again.
Amy,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
Amy,"All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
Amy,I’m sure it was.
Amy,"Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting."
Amy,How’s it going?
Amy,Great.
Amy,Really? Is that what you think?
Amy,"Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right."
Amy,Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
Amy,"Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it."
Amy,"You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you."
Amy,"Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?"
Amy,No. But your thumb does.
Amy,"Yeah, you’re a biologist."
Amy,What do you want?
Amy,Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
Amy,That’s not an apology.
Amy,I want a real apology.
Amy,No.
Amy,No.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,"You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday."
Amy,I got you a little something.
Amy,What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
Amy,"No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it."
Amy,I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
Amy,Do you like it?
Amy,"So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
Amy,No problem.
Amy,"Oh, what a great movie."
Amy,My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
Amy,"I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny."
Amy,"You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving."
Amy,Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?
Amy,Why?
Amy,You hate it.
Amy,I feel like an idiot.
Amy,Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.
Amy,I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.
Amy,Don’t bother.
Amy,"I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting."
Amy,I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
Amy,"Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me."
Amy,I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.
Amy,"If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand."
Amy,"I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now."
Amy,No. Damage is done.
Amy,"Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
Amy,You have such a good heart.
Amy,Come on.
Amy,We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
Amy,"Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us."
Amy,Little higher on the right.
Amy,Little more. No. That’s got it.
Amy,I’ll let you in on a little secret.
Amy,"Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
Amy,"But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
Amy,Sure.
Amy,"I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
Amy,What about Supercuts?
Amy,"Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
Amy,"Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
Amy,He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
Amy,That was kind of uncalled for.
Amy,There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.
Amy,There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
Amy,"Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party."
Amy,She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
Amy,"No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none."
Amy,You use it to get your way.
Amy,You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.
Amy,Good morning.
Amy,"I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth."
Amy,You sure you’re okay with this?
Amy,Thank you. That means a lot to me.
Amy,"Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?"
Amy,"You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game."
Amy,My boyfriend’s a jerk.
Amy,"I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?"
Amy,The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
Amy,"Oh, that’s good."
Amy,I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
Amy,"Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,"He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
Amy,Yeah.
Amy,Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
Amy,I don’t think I want to play a game.
Amy,Like that?
Amy,"Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
Amy,That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
Amy,What?
Amy,What’s the difference?
Amy,How do I get him to treat me better?
Amy,"No, he loves that."
Amy,Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
Amy,I don’t think I’d be good at that.
Amy,"I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
Amy,"And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin."
Amy,Armin… damn it.
Amy,You’re hurting me.
Amy,Before; now it’s you.
Amy,"Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go."
Amy,What about the Science Center?
Amy,Rain check.
Amy,"All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
Amy,Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
Amy,"Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
Amy,"No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later."
Amy,"I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
Amy,Right. And that was…
Amy,I don’t think that was helpful.
Amy,Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
Amy,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess."
Amy,"Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour. "
Amy,This is kind of hot.
Amy,"Seven o’clock, right on time."
Amy,"Well, dinner’s almost ready."
Amy,"Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight."
Amy,"With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
Amy,"I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
Amy,I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
Amy,"Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
Amy,"We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat.
Amy,May I offer you something to drink?
Amy,Not even strawberry Quik?
Amy,"Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner."
Amy,Just like your mommy used to make.
Amy,"Hello, Leonard."
Amy,We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.
Amy,"I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?"
Amy,"The uterus quivers, does it not?"
Amy,"No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight."
Amy,"Well, it was going to be mine."
Amy,Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
Amy,"It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?"
Amy,I know.
Amy,"Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?"
Amy,"All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me."
Amy,"Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth."
Amy,Who is it?
Amy,Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
Amy,"All right, that’s enough from the both of you."
Amy,"Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out."
Amy,"This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend."
Amy,"Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy."
Amy,How long does this stay on?
Amy,"Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face."
Amy,"No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?"
Amy,"Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go."
Amy,"Sheldon, this place is so romantic. "
Amy,"Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you."
Amy,I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?
Amy,"On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay."
Amy,You found a loophole?
Amy,I can’t believe I bleached my moustache for this.
Amy,Go home.
Amy,"Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis? 
Amy,You know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
Amy,Dessert is served.
Amy,You know what? I’m done with this.
Amy,I’m leaving.
Amy,You do?
Amy,"Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done."
Amy,"Sheldon, that was beautiful."
Amy,I’ll take it.
Amy,That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
Amy,When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
Amy,‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
Amy,Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.
Amy,You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?
Amy,What does that mean?
Amy,"Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way."
Amy,"Well, I like it."
Amy,Just watch the movie.
Amy,There might be a reason for that.
Amy,Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
Amy,So?
Amy,It’s complicated.
Amy,She’s not sure how she feels.
Amy,"Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard."
Amy,"Yes, please, Penny will kill me."
Amy,Hello?
Amy,"Hang on, please. Hello?"
Amy,I know. She’s yelling at me right now.
Amy,You slept with him?
Amy,"Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog."
Amy,It’s so cute when she tries.
Amy,"Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now."
Amy,"Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist."
Amy,"I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room."
Amy,"Oh, hello. Who are you?"
Amy,I’d like to speak to Sheldon.
Amy,"All right. Well, tell him Amy called."
Amy,He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.
Amy,"Hmm, that’s weird."
Amy,Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.
Amy,You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.
Amy,It’s her I have to worry about.
Amy,"Oh, really? Look at this face  How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?"
Amy,"I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  Aha!"
Amy,Hang on. 
Amy,Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
Amy,"Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment."
Amy,"Look at you, putting on a brave face."
Amy,"Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out."
Amy,"So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable."
Amy,So it does bother you.
Amy,"And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now."
Amy,"Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow."
Amy,"Uh, box? Uh, window?"
Amy,"Uh, gift? Uh, Present!"
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?"
Amy,Now?
Amy,"Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?"
Amy,Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
Amy,"All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?"
Amy,We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
Amy,"Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk."
Amy,"Oh, there he is, I got him."
Amy,"Long division, long division. Go, go, go."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"Ready, set, wrestle.  One, two, three, pin."
Amy,"On the count of three. One, two…"
Amy,"One, two, three, eat."
Amy,Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?
Amy,Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
Amy,And my boyfriend?
Amy,Then what’s your job?
Amy,"That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated."
Amy,Why?
Amy,He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
Amy,I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
Amy,"So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume."
Amy,Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
Amy,Yeah?
Amy,"Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don’t even like."
Amy,"I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?"
Amy,You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
Amy,"No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one."
Amy,"Sheldon, get in here."
Amy,"I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO."
Amy,I once looked in Sheldon’s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
Amy,"Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book."
Amy,Why wouldn’t you tell Leonard?
Amy,You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
Amy,"I can, but she’s sitting right there."
Amy,"Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy."
Amy,"You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
Amy,It’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
Amy,"Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points."
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,How’d it go with Leonard?
Amy,Understood.
Amy,You’re smart.
Amy,I feel like I’m in high school again.
Amy,I know. It’s finally working.
Amy,Cut.
Amy,"Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden."
Amy,"Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action."
Amy,Cut.
Amy,"It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat."
Amy,"You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good."
Amy,"Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action."
Amy,"Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action."
Amy,Cut.
Amy,He was overacting on purpose.
Amy,You gonna let him speak to me like that?
Amy,Can I speak to you for a second?
Amy,"I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave."
Amy,Fine. Then maybe I should go.
Amy,You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
Amy,"I’m mad at you, Sheldon."
Amy,"I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night."
Amy,What?
Amy,Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
Amy,"Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton."
Amy,"A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?"
Amy,I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.
Amy,Sure.
Amy,"For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask."
Amy,"I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns."
Amy,"I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun."
Amy,"Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius."
Amy,If and when?
Amy,That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
Amy,"Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb."
Amy,This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
Amy,Freaking pigs.
Amy,"Wait, I’m leaving my car here?"
Amy,"Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today."
Amy,What do you think?
Amy,"Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?"
Amy,He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
Amy,In Sheldon’s spot.
Amy,"Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars."
Amy,Why not?
Amy,You?
Amy,"Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming. "
Amy,"Oh, my God,"
Amy,"Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank."
Amy,Are you okay?
Amy,"I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry."
Amy,You had my car towed.
Amy,I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.
Amy,I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
Amy,How do you know?
Amy,"Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer."
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Amy,I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.
Amy,"Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?"
Amy,"But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
Amy,"Never mind. Good night, Sheldon."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Amy,"Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour."
Amy,"I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking."
Amy,Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
Amy,"Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest."
Amy,"You, you want to rub something on my chest?"
Amy,Maybe we should start with that.
Amy,"Oh, I’m counting on it."
Amy,That was great. Rub my chest again.  
Amy,I don’t have a bath thermometer.
Amy,"Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick."
Amy,I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
Amy,See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
Amy,All right. I’ll tell him.
Amy,I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath."
Amy,Oh?
Amy,"All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me."
Amy,I feel terrible I did this.
Amy,I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?
Amy,I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
Amy,Are you saying you want to spank me?
Amy,That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.
Amy,One second. I want to put on some music.
Amy,I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
Amy,"Oh, my."
Amy,Then maybe you should spank me harder.
Amy,Ooh!
Amy,"Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons."
Amy,Why not?
Amy,By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
Amy,Maybe another time.
Amy,"So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?"
Amy,"Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?"
Amy,Thanks.
Amy,Let’s get him laid!
Amy,That is some low-hanging fruit.
Amy,The two of them? I don’t understand.
Amy,And you liked Bernadette also?
Amy,"So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too."
Amy,"It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin."
Amy,Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.
Amy,"You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on."
Amy,"I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it."
Amy,"It is, isn’t it?"
Amy,"I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too."
Amy,"Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now."
Amy,"It’s your assistant Alex, isn’t it?"
Amy,"She’s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower."
Amy,Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
Amy,When did Howard learn to sew?
Amy,I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
Amy,"It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment."
Amy,No.
Amy,Seriously?
Amy,"Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys."
Amy,"All right, well, who’s the best superhero?"
Amy,"Ooh, I do love a bad boy."
Amy,"Well, there was a lot of action."
Amy,"And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?"
Amy,So stupid.
Amy,What a waste of time.
Amy,"No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Maybe we missed something.
Amy,Yeah.
Amy,Good idea. I’ll help you.
Amy,"We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start."
Amy,"It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."
Amy,No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.
Amy,"Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions."
Amy,"Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously."
Amy,"You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up."
Amy,Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
Amy,Yeah?
Amy,"No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer."
Amy,Did that ever happen?
Amy,The strap is part of the hammer.
Amy,"All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?"
Amy,"Sheldon, what’s going on?"
Amy,"Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?"
Amy,How’s that?
Amy,Children’s toy.
Amy,Children’s toy.
Amy,"So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?"
Amy,No.
Amy,Like a dog-boy.
Amy,What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
Amy,Great. Here I am!
Amy,Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?
Amy,"Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?"
Amy,Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
Amy,See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
Amy,"Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?"
Amy,Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,"Yes. I did good, right?"
Amy,No.
Amy,"Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us."
Amy,And this is Amy.
Amy,"‘Cause we out dropping science, son."
Amy,Beep.
Amy,What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
Amy,"Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it."
Amy,"Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here."
Amy,What?
Amy,"Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with Leonard."
Amy,You’re a coward.
Amy,You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
Amy,"I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?"
Amy,Hello.
Amy,Happy Valentine’s Day.
Amy,"Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts."
Amy,"And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day."
Amy,"By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things."
Amy,"Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?"
Amy,"Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do."
Amy,"I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return."
Amy,What’s this?
Amy,"Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?"
Amy,"In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me."
Amy,And you picked me.
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon."
Amy,"Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot."
Amy,"Fine. Just hold on. Mommy’s on the phone! Sorry. We’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow."
Amy,"Oh, that’s right. How’d it go with Penny?"
Amy,"Subtle, but powerful."
Amy,Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
Amy,"Because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. I’m sure she’d like to hear it."
Amy,"I didn’t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I’d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it."
Amy,Why? What happened?
Amy,"Sheldon, that’s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play."
Amy,That better be Tootsie Rolls you’re throwing at me!
Amy,"Sadly, I’m no longer associated with that project."
Amy,"Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional."
Amy,"Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic."
Amy,Our Penny’s a star.
Amy,"Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row."
Amy,I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
Amy,Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
Amy,"Me, too."
Amy,"Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?"
Amy,I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
Amy,"Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland."
Amy,"So, what are we gonna do first?"
Amy,"Ooh, that sounds like fun."
Amy,"Come on, do it with us."
Amy,"Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too."
Amy,Then how do we decide?
Amy,"It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist."
Amy,"The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds."
Amy,"Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up."
Amy,"Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle."
Amy,His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
Amy,I can’t believe he set it on fire.
Amy,"Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter."
Amy,"Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?"
Amy,You have something we want.
Amy,"Sheldon, that’s not a real thing."
Amy,This is really fun.
Amy,Absolutely.
Amy,Hey.
Amy,"Me, too."
Amy,Use me as a human shield!
Amy,Told you.
Amy,"You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you."
Amy,"No, it’s not."
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time."
Amy,Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
Amy,Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?
Amy,"Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family."
Amy,"You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision."
Amy,You don’t say.
Amy,Is that a problem?
Amy,"Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense."
Amy,It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
Amy,"Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along."
Amy,"Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate."
Amy,Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.
Amy,"Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?"
Amy,The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
Amy,Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
Amy,No.
Amy,I’d like to know why Penny’s here.
Amy,She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard’s cause.
Amy,"You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?"
Amy,Sheldon!
Amy,"Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends."
Amy,Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
Amy,"I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this."
Amy,"Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure."
Amy,"You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less."
Amy,You sure about that?
Amy,I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
Amy,"All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…"
Amy,I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.
Amy,Yep. Your turn.
Amy,Exactly. How does that make you feel?
Amy,And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
Amy,"Come on, you can do this."
Amy,"Yeah, sounds like a drag."
Amy,Let’s box it up.
Amy,I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
Amy,And?
Amy,"I’m proud of you, Sheldon. "
Amy,"No rules? We’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?"
Amy,So there are some rules.
Amy,Thank you. Vegas!
Amy,I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
Amy,"‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing."
Amy,"Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow."
Amy,I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
Amy,You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas."
Amy,Here we go. Fifteen?
Amy,"Sheldon, they’re talking about sex."
Amy,I don’t like this.
Amy,What?
Amy,You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.
Amy,I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
Amy,"Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?"
Amy,And now?
Amy,Do you have any interest now?
Amy,Wow. Talk dirty to me.
Amy,"I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more."
Amy,Come on. Let’s go back out there.
Amy,Okay.
Amy,Oh.
Amy,I kiss you on the lips.
Amy,I remove your armour. What do you do?
Amy,Keep rolling.
Amy,Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my  14! Yes!
Amy,"Hello, Rajesh."
Amy,And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
Amy,It should be me.
Amy,"A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family."
Amy,"So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me."
Amy,"Maybe next week, we could all get together."
Amy,Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
Amy,"Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!"
Amy,"Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming."
Amy,"Me, too."
Amy,Does he ever shut up?
Amy,"Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
Amy,"Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag."
Amy,"Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag."
Amy,And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
Amy,"Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation."
Amy,"Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
Amy,"You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny."
Amy,So what happened? How’d it go?
Amy,So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
Amy,And why would no one blame me?
Amy,"Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon."
Amy,"No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that."
Amy,And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?
Amy,"We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
Amy,Sure.
Amy,Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
Amy,Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
Amy,Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
Amy,I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
Amy,"Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan."
Amy,Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
Amy,"Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
Amy,Then what does tweepadock mean?
Amy,Lucky guess.
Amy,What happened?
Amy,What?
Amy,I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
Amy,You’re being ridiculous.
Amy,Poor Leonard.
Amy,Do you hear anything?
Amy,Is it Penny?
Amy,"Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
Amy,Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
Amy,"No, Sheldon, don’t."
Amy,Please leave me out of this.
Amy,"Hello, sailor."
Amy,Driving Sheldon to work.
Amy,"Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray."
Amy,"Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…"
Amy,Really?
Amy,You want to take the bus to work?
Amy,"FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
Amy,"We’re sorry, Rajesh. "
Amy,"Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny."
Amy,"Yeah, me, too."
Amy,Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
Amy,Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
Amy,"I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that."
Amy,I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
Amy,No.
Amy,I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
Amy,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you."
Amy,Such as?
Amy,"Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…"
Amy,Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member. 
Amy,"Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?"
Amy,I love Neil Diamond.
Amy,"Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it."
Amy,"Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be "
Amy,To the Neil Mobile.
Amy,They’re coming to America. 
Amy,They’re coming to America… ♪
Amy,Today!
Amy,Ain’t no big surprise.
Amy,And I’ll tell you some lies. 
Amy,There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month.
Amy,She got the way to groove me.
Amy,"She got the way to move me, honey."
Amy,It was good.
Amy,"I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time."
Amy,It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
Amy,"All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
Amy,"No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya."
Amy,"Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
Amy,So what can I do for you?
Amy,Really?
Amy,That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
Amy,Of course I’m in.
Amy,"Good night, Dr. Cooper."
Amy,I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
Amy,You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Amy,"Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge."
Amy,"Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it."
Amy,I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.
Amy,Do you feel better?
Amy,It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
Amy,"Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you."
Amy,I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. 
Amy,"So, you’re okay with this?"
Amy,"Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
Amy,"Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
Amy,I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
Amy,"Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?"
Amy,I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
Amy,Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. 
Amy,"No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project."
Amy,"Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together."
Amy,"Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
Amy,More and more sure.
Amy,I didn’t ask for your permission.
Amy,Gentlemen.
Amy,And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
Amy,"Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?"
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,"Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking."
Amy,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Amy,"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?"
Amy,Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
Amy,"I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. "
Amy,"You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup."
Amy,You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.
Amy,Really? What tipped you off?
Amy,Get out.
Amy,"Image number six, woman giving birth."
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
Amy,No.
Amy,What do you want?
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo."
Amy,What’s your point?
Amy,"I like you, too."
Amy,"Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him."
Amy,"Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut."
Amy,"Oh, I love that."
Amy,I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker. 
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m so proud of you."
Amy,What’s next?
Amy,And what?
Amy,What’s wrong?
Amy,What are you talking about?
Amy,That Americans can’t handle the metric system?
Amy,But the Chinese team found the element.
Amy,So you just got lucky?
Amy,"You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
Amy,I’m not.
Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you."
Amy,Poor Bernadette.
Amy,"Sheldon, get over here."
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,Shh.
Amy,Me? What did I do?
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon."
Amy,"Can’t talk, in the zone."
Amy,I’ve never seen him this happy before.
Amy,"Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity."
Amy,"Sheldon, come on."
Amy,Is it really worth getting upset about?
Amy,"Come on, he’s a retired kids show host."
Amy,Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
Amy,"Maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
Amy,"From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…"
Amy,Doesn’t matter.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.
Amy,How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
Amy,I’m making a bracelet.
Amy,"Actually, I’d kind of like to try that."
Amy,"Wow, Penny, good job."
Amy,What are you working on?
Amy,That’s sweet.
Amy,Hello.
Amy,"So, what tools did you bring?"
Amy,"Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"
Amy,"They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it."
Amy,"At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart."
Amy,We’re never getting our drinks.
Amy,Not even close.
Amy,You want to say sorry.
Amy,You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
Amy,"I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity."
Amy,Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?
Amy,I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?
Amy,Seriously?
Amy,"I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
Amy,"Sheldon, that was diabolical."
Amy,We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
Amy,Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
Amy,They’re real.
Amy,"No traffic, we’re sailing."
Amy,"Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave."
Amy,It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
Amy,"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"
Amy,"Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner."
Amy,Happy Thanksgiving.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,You need any help?
Amy,"Uh, sure."
Amy,Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
Amy,Ooh!
Amy,I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.
Amy,"Broad shoulders, good hair."
Amy,I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
Amy,Zack’s here!
Amy,"All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,"Yeah, everything was delicious."
Amy,"I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding."
Amy,"Sheldon, can I come in?"
Amy,No.
Amy,"Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
Amy,"Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things."
Amy,"Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so… "
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?"
Amy,"Thank you, Rajesh."
Amy,You should probably go.
Amy,"A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
Amy,I’ll get the vodka.
Amy,"Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid."
Amy,Right now? Why?
Amy,How come you never said she was pregnant?
Amy,Can I give you a ride to the airport?
Amy,"Yeah, kinda."
Amy,That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?
Amy,"Oh, I love that movie."
Amy,It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
Amy,"You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now."
Amy,It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny.
Amy,"Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up."
Amy,Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
Amy,"And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean."
Amy,Where’d you go?
Amy,"Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee."
Amy,"Wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
Amy,"It’s hard to say, my life would be so different."
Amy,I don’t know.
Amy,"Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. "
Amy,Yay.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, you should go."
Amy,"Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew."
Amy,"If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it."
Amy,I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.
Amy,I don’t understand.
Amy,"Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?"
Amy,I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.
Amy,"That’s fine, she’s dead."
Amy,Just really glad you’re back.
Amy,I missed you.
Amy,Did you miss me?
Amy,Oh.
Amy,Did you hold the baby?
Amy,And? How did it make you feel?
Amy,"This is nice, that we all get to eat together."
Amy,Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
Amy,Congratulations.
Amy,What’s the show?
Amy,He’s wrong.
Amy,Why?
Amy,Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
Amy,"Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…"
Amy,"Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny."
Amy,"Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…  Okay, that’s pretty good."
Amy,I guess.
Amy,Sure.
Amy,I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.
Amy,"Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
Amy,Hello.
Amy,He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
Amy,"It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?"
Amy,"Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
Amy,"Hey, what brings you guys here?"
Amy,"Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse."
Amy,"That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert."
Amy,This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
Amy,"Oh, you forgot your quartz."
Amy,He’s nice.
Amy,"What?! No, he doesn’t."
Amy,So? He does that every day. Oh.
Amy,He’s not my boyfriend.
Amy,Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
Amy,What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
Amy,I guess it hasn’t come up.
Amy,I’m sorry. Who are you dating?
Amy,Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?
Amy,That’s nice.
Amy,"Hello, Bert."
Amy,"Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend."
Amy,Weren’t you?
Amy,"That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend."
Amy,"No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you."
Amy,Don’t say that. 
Amy,"No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you."
Amy,"No, it’s not."
Amy,So what am I supposed to do now?
Amy,"This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him."
Amy,"Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?"
Amy,"Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
Amy,Really? You would do that?
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,"Last week, you spent that on a little dress. "
Amy,"Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
Amy,Oh. You mean like a museum?
Amy,"Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
Amy,There sure are a lot of little kids here.
Amy,"Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. "
Amy,It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
Amy,"Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
Amy,"On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good."
Amy,Gosh.
Amy,I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
Amy,I told you it was Penny.
Amy,"Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are."
Amy,"Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision."
Amy,"I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable."
Amy,"We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day."
Amy,"Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
Amy,I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Why not?"
Amy,"One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us."
Amy,I got you your own room. 
Amy,It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
Amy,We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
Amy,An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
Amy,"Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic."
Amy,I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
Amy,"What do you think, Sheldon?"
Amy,I’m so glad you like it.
Amy,"Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute."
Amy,See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
Amy,Why do I even try?
Amy,It’s feeling like it never will.
Amy,Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
Amy,I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
Amy,"Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now."
Amy,"Oh, give it a rest."
Amy,Why are you still here?
Amy,I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
Amy,Leave.
Amy,It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
Amy,"Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen."
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,That was nice.
Amy,"Okay, have fun."
Amy,Really? I do.
Amy,"Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job."
Amy,Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
Amy,"I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?"
Amy,"Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me."
Amy,Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.
Amy,"All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?"
Amy,"Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey."
Amy,Of course I was.
Amy,"I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it."
Amy,"I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too."
Amy,Which you also figured out by yourself.
Amy,Which is stronger than ever.
Amy,You don’t need to explain yourself to him.
Amy,You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
Amy,"Damn it, I got cocky."
Amy,Rajesh?
Amy,Can I borrow it when you’re done?
Amy,I think we’re gonna go.
Amy,I think we’re gonna go.
Amy,Really?
Amy,Thanks for walking me to my car.
Amy,Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
Amy,Whatever happened with your online dating?
Amy,"Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact."
Amy,Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
Amy,That’s true. Do whatever you want.
Amy,Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
Amy,"Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa."
Amy,"Great, so what do you need me for?"
Amy,All right.
Amy,Wow.
Amy,"No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy."
Amy,"Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”"
Amy,I’m not gonna pretend to be you.
Amy,"Well, what would I say to her?"
Amy,No. What’s up?
Amy,I have.
Amy,And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
Amy,"I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive."
Amy,"Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night."
Amy,I’m meeting her for coffee.
Amy,"Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."
Amy,"No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting."
Amy,"Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
Amy,Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
Amy,Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?
Amy,"Oh, hi."
Amy,I don’t know.
Amy,I’m leaving.
Amy,"Yeah, it’s Bloom."
Amy,I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
Amy,"Oh, ugh."
Amy,"According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first."
Amy,"Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase."
Amy,That is so sweet.
Amy,What’s it for?
Amy,But why?
Amy,"Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea."
Amy,"What does your card say, Bernadette?"
Amy,"Dun, dun, dun. He started it."
Amy,I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
Amy,"Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard."
Amy,Excuse me?
Amy,It actually was kind of fun.
Amy,Yeah.
Amy,Of course.
Amy,I’m sure it’s lovable.
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"Oh, my gosh."
Amy,"No. No, it was a mistake."
Amy,Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?
Amy,You’ll get offered something soon.
Amy,"Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?"
Amy,"Can you get the butter, please?"
Amy,Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
Amy,"Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention."
Amy,No way.
Amy,"Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat."
Amy,Included?
Amy,Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
Amy,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?"
Amy,You’re kidding.
Amy,This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?
Amy,Please pass the butter!
Amy,You’re welcome.
Amy,"Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?"
Amy,No.
Amy,"I’m proud of you, Sheldon."
Amy,"Well, that’s got to be a good feeling."
Amy,"Oh, crap."
Amy,You were just a little kid.
Amy,How old were you then?
Amy,What’s a Zune?
Amy,"No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research."
Amy,You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
Amy,Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
Amy,"How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome."
Amy,"So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One."
Amy,What is it?
Amy,Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.
Amy,I can’t feel my legs.
Amy,"Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat."
Amy,"What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?"
Amy,Sorry I’m late. What did you do?
Amy,"Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick."
Amy,"Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?"
Amy,Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
Amy,I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
Amy,How does that happen?
Amy,"Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink."
Amy,That’s what I’m saying.
Amy,"I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory."
Amy,But none of that means we don’t love you.
Amy,I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?
Amy,Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
Amy,And you don’t feel guilty about it?
Amy,"I know, it’s weird, right?"
Amy,"Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now."
Amy,Is she still mad?
Amy,"A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
Amy,Because she has sex with you.
Amy,"Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are."
Amy,"I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him."
Amy,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already."
Amy,Really? What did you do?
Amy,"Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you."
Amy,Watching your old friend?
Amy,Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
Amy,Why not?
Amy,Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
Amy,And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?
Amy,Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.
Amy,"No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
Amy,"Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating."
Amy,I wonder why that is.
Amy,Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?
Amy,"I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science."
Amy,That’s cute.
Amy,"Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts."
Amy,My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
Amy,"Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
Amy,"Hey, guys."
Amy,Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
Amy,Should we do something for her?
Amy,"Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt."
Amy,Good for you.
Amy,How many is that now?
Amy,Atomic magnets?
Amy,"So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?"
Amy,"Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
Amy,They just don’t appreciate you.
Amy,"Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik."
Amy,"You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there."
Amy,You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
Amy,See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.
Amy,"And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together."
Amy,"Sheldon, it was just a thought."
Amy,It tastes the same.
Amy,"Hi, is Sheldon here?"
Amy,"He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone."
Amy,He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
Amy,I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
Amy,"You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?"
Amy,That’s nice.
Amy,"Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?"
Amy,Right.
Amy,Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
Amy,How could you let him go?
Amy,"My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,"
Amy,Are you okay?
Amy,"What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
Amy,Fine. Whisper it.
Amy,Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
Amy,"I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?"
Amy,We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
Amy,Can I stop now?
Amy,You were worried about that?
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect."
Amy,Sure.
Amy,But you still accomplished something.
Amy,But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.
Amy,See? This trip was good for you.
Amy,I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
Amy,Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
Amy,How come?
Amy,"Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
Amy,I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
Amy,"Okay, so no Bernadette."
Amy,"No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face."
Amy,"I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends."
Amy,"I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?"
Amy,"Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name."
Amy,"Hey, what’s going on?"
Amy,No Penny?
Amy,Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
Amy,"I do, I see it."
Amy,That’s outrageous.
Amy,"If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
Amy,I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
Amy,"So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette."
Amy,"Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more."
Amy,But I’m just…
Amy,"You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now."
Amy,"Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs."
Amy,"Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?"
Amy,"Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend."
Amy,"Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine."
Amy,"Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?"
Amy,"Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position."
Amy,"You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend."
Amy,"No, and neither did our waiter."
Amy,It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
Amy,"Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?"
Amy,"It’s better than hot, it’s binding."
Amy,You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
Amy,I then suggested a pub.
Amy,"After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
Amy,"There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc."
Amy,"It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire."
Amy,So when do you guys plan on getting married?
Amy,Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
Amy,"They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour."
Amy,Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
Amy,I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.
Amy,"No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place."
Amy,It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you expect?"
Amy,"I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
Amy,Does it matter?
Amy,"So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?"
Amy,"I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off."
Amy,We have led different lives.
Amy,You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
Amy,"I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones."
Amy,Hmm-hmm.
Amy,"What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine."
Amy,You’re right. Cheers.
Amy,"I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back."
Amy,Shh. Amy’s here now.
Amy,Of course.
Amy,"I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon."
Amy,"Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?"
Amy,Then I think it’s a terrific idea.
Amy,Of course I do.
Amy,"I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed."
Amy,Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.
Amy,But they play Barry Manilow.
Amy,But they’re called Fairly Manilow.
Amy,Great.
Amy,What if we don’t want to vomit?
Amy,What?
Amy,What does that mean?
Amy,Can you start in the morning?
Amy,"So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…"
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow."
Amy,"Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying."
Amy,It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.
Amy,"Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’."
Amy,"Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?"
Amy,"Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine."
Amy,"No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
Amy,We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
Amy,Why’d you tell her? It was working.
Amy,We’re having the best time.
Amy,"Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers."
Amy,Can you believe this nerd?
Amy,"Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club."
Amy,"We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?"
Amy,"Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority."
Amy,No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
Amy,Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this."
Amy,I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
Amy,"Okay, just checking."
Amy,Anything else?
Amy,"Sheldon, is everything okay?"
Amy,11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.
Amy,Do you really need me to transcribe this?
Amy,I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
Amy,I think it’s awful.
Amy,"Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?"
Amy,I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
Amy,"Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science."
Amy,"So, how was work today?"
Amy,What happened?
Amy,"Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine."
Amy,"Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled."
Amy,I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
Amy,"I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress."
Amy,"Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day."
Amy,But it was bad publicity.
Amy,"I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us."
Amy,You have a nice night.
Amy,Nice flowers.
Amy,Isn’t she lucky?
Amy,What’s that?
Amy,I guess that’s all anybody wants.
Amy,"Well, I hope you get it."
Amy,I can’t take these.
Amy,But what about the other girl?
Amy,We all have a past.
Amy,That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
Amy,"Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?"
Amy,Sure.
Amy,Hi.
Amy,What’s with the clothes?
Amy,"I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?"
Amy,Easy.
Amy,"No, but I was on clean-up crew."
Amy,"No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red."
Amy,"Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging."
Amy,My date would’ve had to clean that up.
Amy,"Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos."
Amy,You went to seven proms?
Amy,"Sheldon, you look so handsome."
Amy,What’s that?
Amy,Where are you going?
Amy,"Sheldon, can I come in?"
Amy,Why not?
Amy,You’re making me worry. What’s going on?
Amy,What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye."
Amy,You did?
Amy,"Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together."
Amy,I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
Amy,"Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…"
Amy,You said it.
Amy,Okay.
Amy,This is an easy one. You love this guy.
Amy,"Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius."
Amy,"It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him."
Amy,"How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,Hello.
Amy,Did they figure out what’s wrong?
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring."
Amy,Okay.
Amy,Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.
Amy,It’s nice they’re getting exercise.
Amy,I’m sure he brought it.
Amy,"He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it."
Amy,"I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth."
Amy,Twenty eight.
Amy,Fifty six.
Amy,"All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now."
Amy,"Just go to work, he’ll be fine."
Amy,Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.
Amy,"He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
Amy,"Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery."
Amy,Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
Amy,Who told you to keep going around?
Amy,"Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself."
Amy,And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
Amy,"Sheldon, you can’t go back there."
Amy,Are you okay?
Amy,Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.
Amy,Sheldon will move out eventually.
Amy,I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
Amy,"And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
Amy,After only 232 episodes.
Amy,You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
Amy,That was a good one.
Amy,"And, yes, even shed a tear or two."
Amy,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
Amy,"Australia, mate."
Amy,"Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?"
Amy,"Then who did sew it, hmm?"
Amy,I do.
Amy,"Wow, that flag is a lifesaver."
Amy,Action.
Amy,"Take that, glass ceiling."
Amy,"Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful."
Amy,I pressed it.
Amy,"Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?"
Amy,"If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father."
Amy,"I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding."
Amy,You’re going.
Amy,I don’t hate you. I love you.
Amy,What’s going on?
Amy,"Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play."
Amy,"Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off."
Amy,You won.
Amy,Thank you. And it’s figs.
Amy,"Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good."
Amy,You got me something?
Amy,Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.
Amy,"No, I love it."
Amy,"Actually, I did get you something."
Amy,"Well, you got me something. Here."
Amy,They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
Amy,"Merry Christmas, Sheldon."
Amy,Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
Amy,"One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
Amy,"Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight."
Amy,I will literally race you to the car.
Amy,"Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen."
Amy,Sheldon?
Amy,"I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off."
Amy,There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
Amy,I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
Amy,"Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown."
Amy,Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
Amy,What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
Amy,You guys comfy? This might take a while.
Amy,How’s it going in there?
Amy,Sure.
Amy,"Yeah, but it’s okay."
Amy,"I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did."
Amy,Really?
Amy,Basket weaving at the craft museum.
Amy,Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk.
Amy,"Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket."
Amy,Very nice.
Amy,"33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline."
Amy,It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
Amy,"All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
Amy,Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?
Amy,"Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana."
Amy,My mother said that’s how good girls do it.
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for."
Amy,"And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?"
Amy,"Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
Amy,Because you’re happy they’re elevated.
Amy,That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.
Amy,"If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?"
Amy,"No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?"
Amy,"You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t forget about date night."
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
Amy,Fine. How was your day?
Amy,"Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell."
Amy,"Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off."
Amy,"I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night."
Amy,"Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
Amy,You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
Amy,That’s not true.
Amy,"Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
Amy,"Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety."
Amy,"It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off."
Amy,Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
Amy,They have it.
Amy,Please?
Amy,Have you even seen it?
Amy,Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.
Amy,What is it?
Amy,What?
Amy,I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
Amy,Play it again. Play it again.
Amy,Why? What did I do?
Amy,"No, please don’t."
Amy,But it’s personal.
Amy,No.
Amy,"It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with."
Amy,No.
Amy,Good luck finding it.
Amy,"You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that."
Amy,"He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking."
Amy,In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
Amy,"Okay, that’s enough."
Amy,You’re just making fun of me.
Amy,"Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life."
Amy,"She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper."
Amy,"“What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…"
Amy,Sure.
Amy,How many?
Amy,Is that really true?
Amy,What’s this for?
Amy,"Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it."
Amy,"Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal."
Amy,"I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
Amy,"Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty."
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s me."
Amy,What are you talking about?
Amy,"Sheldon, open the door."
Amy,I just saw you.
Amy,"Oh, hey."
Amy,"It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars."
Amy,"So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
Amy,"Wow, the store looks great."
Amy,That’s not true.
Amy,"Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall."
Amy,How can I make this up to you?
Amy,One of us would have taken you in.
Amy,"She did that to me, too."
Amy,I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
Amy,And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
Amy,"Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night."
Amy,No.
Amy,Forget it.
Amy,"That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart."
Amy,Why?
Amy,I think we’re safe.
Amy,The two of us could do it.
Amy,What’s the first question?
Amy,"Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up."
Amy,Sounds good.
Amy,Did he say anything about the funeral?
Amy,"Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick."
Amy,Oh.
Amy,"So, how do we start?"
Amy,"Keep it down, we’re working here."
Amy,We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
Amy,"Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son."
Amy,"So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?"
Amy,"Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
Amy,We have some exciting news.
Amy,"After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
Amy,Let’s say it together.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
Amy,"For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone."
Amy,That’s what I said.
Amy,It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.
Amy,"Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?"
Amy,"Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead."
Amy,"But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work."
Amy,What are you talking about?
Amy,"You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?"
Amy,Of course not.
Amy,No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
Amy,"I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get."
Amy,"Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever."
Amy,I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
Amy,"And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite."
Amy,"You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon."
Amy,No. Forget it.
Amy,Please don’t.
Amy,Why do you even want to do this?
Amy,Can’t you just tell me?
Amy,I think I’m gonna go home.
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something."
Amy,Sure. Unless something better comes along.
Amy,What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
Amy,We’re on the same planet.
Amy,Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
Amy,Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
Amy,"You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars."
Amy,"Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians."
Amy,"I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple."
Amy,"I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t."
Amy,"Oh, let me see."
Amy,"Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all."
Amy,It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
Amy,Poor Leonard.
Amy,He might not be.
Amy,Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?
Amy,So you see what I’m getting at?
Amy,No.
Amy,Try again.
Amy,"Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad."
Amy,Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
Amy,Exactly.
Amy,"Well, that is an important part."
Amy,But Leonard’s idea was good.
Amy,It’s not your fault.
Amy,Not your fault.
Amy,"Hey, look at that pretty bird."
Amy,Do you need any help in the kitchen?
Amy,"Yes, so please behave yourselves."
Amy,All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
Amy,"Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women."
Amy,"Ooh, please do, Rajesh."
Amy,We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,And girls.
Amy,I don’t hear it.
Amy,Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
Amy,Are you all set for your trip?
Amy,"Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?"
Amy,Can I be in charge of pricing? I’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?
Amy,"I had a table, too, but I didn’t have any friends, so all I did was serve."
Amy,"And if I had a friend, they might have told me that."
Amy,Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.
Amy,"Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat."
Amy,"If you still have that bra, I’ll give you a nickel for it."
Amy,"Rajesh eight, Penny four."
Amy,Eight-five.
Amy,"Uh, it, it’s been a long time. I don’t know. I’m probably pretty rusty."
Amy,That’s not nice.
Amy,"Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds."
Amy,Keep talking.
Amy,Really should have thought this through.
Amy,Can you please pass the salt?
Amy,Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
Amy,"No, Sheldon."
Amy,"According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night."
Amy,"Well, it applies to you, too."
Amy,Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
Amy,Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
Amy,"When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees."
Amy,"And at the same time, not."
Amy,"You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort."
Amy,More juvenile than this?
Amy,"How’s it going, Sheldon?"
Amy,Can I come in?
Amy,Amazing.
Amy,What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.
Amy,"I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold."
Amy,And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.
Amy,We both know this one’s gonna win.
Amy,"Come on, I’ll help you take this down."
Amy,"Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
Amy,It’s a big fort.
Amy,PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
Amy,You got yourself a sleepover.
Amy,Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
Amy,Who says this is the only one I hid?
Amy,"Yes, they are."
Amy,"Okay, have a seat on the floor."
Amy,I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
Amy,"And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
Amy,"Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
Amy,I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.
Amy,With a beautiful girl on your arm.
Amy,It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
Amy,"Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals."
Amy,"He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years."
Amy,Do you think the moms will get along?
Amy,Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
Amy,That’s what you’re thinking about?
Amy,Are any of them me?
Amy,What are you doing?
Amy,"I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show."
Amy,"Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
Amy,"Oh, sure, I’d love to."
Amy,"I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years."
Amy,"Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation."
Amy,I hope you understand.
Amy,"Bye, Sheldon."
Amy,Not really. Can you come over?
Amy,Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
Amy,Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
Amy,Oh. What are you doing here?
Amy,"Well, it’s only been 11 hours."
Amy,"Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know."
Amy,Sure.
Amy,We’re not back together.
Amy,"If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding."
Amy,There’s no guy.
Amy,I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.
Amy,Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
Amy,Thank you for doing this.
Amy,"We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling."
Amy,Oh. What was her name?
Amy,"Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better."
Amy,"They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here."
Amy,I said I needed time to think.
Amy,It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
Amy,"You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up."
Amy,Yeah.
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,I just hope I did the right thing.
Amy,Like you’re doing right now?
Amy,What do you want?
Amy,What baby?
Amy,I’m hanging up.
Amy,"Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you."
Amy,Because we’re broken up.
Amy,No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.
Amy,"Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
Amy,What are you doing here?
Amy,And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
Amy,Just give me the box.
Amy,Fine. My old scarf.
Amy,"You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
Amy,Whose bra is this?
Amy,It’s Penny’s.
Amy,Good-bye.
Amy,Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
Amy,"Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that."
Amy,That’s because you made him more confident.
Amy,I’m gonna kill him.
Amy,"I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
Amy,I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
Amy,"I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals."
Amy,Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
Amy,I had extra dough.
Amy,"Boy, that was a long night for me."
Amy,"So, Penny, how’s married life?"
Amy,"Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe."
Amy,But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
Amy,"Actually, I was thinking of making one small change."
Amy,Piercing my ears.
Amy,"My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies."
Amy,"I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon."
Amy,Really? You have a piercing gun?
Amy,"Oh, I don’t know."
Amy,"You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship."
Amy,Who?
Amy,Why?
Amy,How long do you think you can keep it from him?
Amy,"That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet."
Amy,"Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats."
Amy,"Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard."
Amy,"Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet."
Amy,I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Amy,Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
Amy,"Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry."
Amy,"Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom."
Amy,"You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?"
Amy,I’m sure you’ll find somebody else.
Amy,"I don’t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life."
Amy,I don’t think that was the point of the movie.
Amy,There you go.
Amy,I can’t believe he ran my credit.
Amy,You really should’ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
Amy,"Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair."
Amy,"Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog."
Amy,Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
Amy,You can say it.
Amy,Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
Amy,"Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity."
Amy,"Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense."
Amy,I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.
Amy,Barry Kripke just asked me out.
Amy,"Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime."
Amy,"I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
Amy,"Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon."
Amy,I don’t know.
Amy,"Oh, I don’t have to imagine it."
Amy,Hello.
Amy,"Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride."
Amy,How have you been?
Amy,How’d that go?
Amy,"Well, actually, he, he already did."
Amy,I said no.
Amy,I didn’t know you were interested in dating.
Amy,"Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good."
Amy,I’m not sure how I feel about this.
Amy,"Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?"
Amy,"Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?"
Amy,"Oh, um, give me that."
Amy,"No, no, stop reading that."
Amy,"No, it, it’s not like that."
Amy,"Okay, it’s like that."
Amy,Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
Amy,It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
Amy,"Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Three.
Amy,Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
Amy,"Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
Amy,Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.
Amy,"Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?"
Amy,Just a little peck on the lips.
Amy,"Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one."
Amy,To that new Italian place on Walnut.
Amy,I’m gonna go look for other shoes.
Amy,"Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
Amy,"Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry."
Amy,"No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship."
Amy,"That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be."
Amy,No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
Amy,"Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you."
Amy,I’m trying not to. Do you know him?
Amy,"Sure, why not?"
Amy,Um about an hour and half.
Amy,Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
Amy,What was the rest of your question?
Amy,Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
Amy,I have a DVD of that lecture.
Amy,"Not as a Valentine’s present, no."
Amy,"That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?"
Amy,"No, you’re not."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,What are you guys doing here?
Amy,No. Pinch me.
Amy,No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.
Amy,"Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out."
Amy,"I’m, I’m really sorry."
Amy,There you go.
Amy,Sure. Heh.
Amy,"Okay, get out."
Amy,No one can go with you?
Amy,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Amy,"Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
Amy,"Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine."
Amy,See you then.
Amy,Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
Amy,Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
Amy,If that makes you more comfortable.
Amy,No. You?
Amy,I might go visit my aunt next week.
Amy,"No, the one in Bakersfield."
Amy,Are we done discussing the weather?
Amy,Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
Amy,I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
Amy,"Man, I walked right into that one."
Amy,"No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
Amy,"So, you had some questions about me seeing other people."
Amy,Go ahead.
Amy,Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
Amy,I mixed them.
Amy,Just one. Are you doing okay?
Amy,Good. I want you to be happy.
Amy,You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
Amy,"Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby."
Amy,Sure. What is it?
Amy,"So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill."
Amy,"It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill."
Amy,Let’s just play.
Amy,"Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated."
Amy,"Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants."
Amy,But you can pal around with a hagfish?
Amy,"Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
Amy,I miss this.
Amy,I guess sometimes I’m silly.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s."
Amy,"I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you."
Amy,"It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again."
Amy,"We are. But I was hoping, maybe…"
Amy,Okay. I understand.
Amy,Okay. Sure.
Amy,"Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy."
Amy,I’m fine. How are you?
Amy,"Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend."
Amy,"Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime."
Amy,Great.
Amy,How ’bout Saturday?
Amy,Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.
Amy,"That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again."
Amy,"Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner."
Amy,It is?
Amy,"You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need."
Amy,Why not?
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,"When you were married, did your wife cook?"
Amy,"So, a little silver lining."
Amy,"Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know."
Amy,"Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere."
Amy,My fault. I brought him up.
Amy,That’s an interesting tie clip.
Amy,"No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh."
Amy,"No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous."
Amy,"You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for."
Amy,That’s Sheldon.
Amy,"Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time."
Amy,What?
Amy,"No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?"
Amy,"I really want that, too."
Amy,"I love you, too."
Amy,Get back here.
Amy,Okay.
Amy,Obi-what?
Amy,"Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?"
Amy,Thanks for taking me out.
Amy,I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.
Amy,Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
Amy,I think I’ll just stick to Mexican.
Amy,"Okay, what is going on?"
Amy,What surprises?
Amy,You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
Amy,"I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say."
Amy,I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed.
Amy,Come in.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon."
Amy,"That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water."
Amy,Do you like it?
Amy,I can change it back.
Amy,"So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?"
Amy,"Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first."
Amy,You mean before you give it to me?
Amy,Of course.
Amy,"Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Hi.
Amy,"So, um, should I get under the covers with you?"
Amy,Hi.
Amy,"I’m just, um, really nervous."
Amy,"Well, I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’ve just built it up in my head. I don’t know what to expect."
Amy,Okay.
Amy,"Me, too."
Amy,That works for me.
Amy,What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
Amy,"Okay, well, I should unpack."
Amy,I will. I wish you were here.
Amy,"Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?"
Amy,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Amy,"Uh, please tell me what to say next."
Amy,"Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?"
Amy,All of them?
Amy,"Okay, I think I know what to say now."
Amy,Are you feeling any better?
Amy,"Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong."
Amy,"Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky."
Amy,"Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended."
Amy,"No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting."
Amy,"Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye."
Amy,"I said what’s new, but sure."
Amy,Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
Amy,"Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them."
Amy,Who else’s side could you have been on?
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them."
Amy,Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.
Amy,Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
Amy,Glad I could help.
Amy,"I feel so, so bad."
Amy,Hi. Nice to meet you.
Amy,How was your trip?
Amy,"That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there."
Amy,Can I have a tissue?
Amy,"Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…"
Amy,"S, s, si, size me up?"
Amy,"Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me."
Amy,I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
Amy,"Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar."
Amy,"Well, now I know."
Amy,"I have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
Amy,"Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work."
Amy,"Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,"Well, maybe I don’t like you either."
Amy,I think I should leave.
Amy,"The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this."
Amy,What ring?
Amy,You have an engagement ring?
Amy,"Penny, did you know about this?"
Amy,When did you get an engagement ring?
Amy,"Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?"
Amy,"Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs."
Amy,Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
Amy,"Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with."
Amy,Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
Amy,Really?
Amy,"Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, thank you."
Amy,I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?
Amy,"So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"
Amy,"Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
Amy,"People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around."
Amy,What do you mean?
Amy,Oh. That is so sweet.
Amy,Catchy.
Amy,"Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live."
Amy,And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
Amy,"Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers."
Amy,"Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions."
Amy,"No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?"
Amy,Rajesh?
Amy,"I, I think it starts with good communication."
Amy,"Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
Amy,Your friend is hurting.
Amy,"Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags."
Amy,"Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship."
Amy,"Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away."
Amy,"Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
Amy,Now?
Amy,Now?
Amy,"Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
Amy,"I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…"
Amy,"…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags."
Amy,"Hello, Kripke."
Amy,It really can.
Amy,"No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard."
Amy,I’m just gonna push all the buttons.
Amy,Really?
Amy,So do I.
Amy,And a lovely Valentine’s Day.
Amy,"Interesting, and when would you use the singular?"
Amy,What?
Amy,This is so exciting.
Amy,I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Amy,"Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this."
Amy,Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
Amy,"Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?"
Amy,Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Amy,"Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?"
Amy,"Yeah, tell us."
Amy,"Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it."
Amy,"Oh, that sounds juicy."
Amy,What?
Amy,How could you do that?
Amy,I do know what that’s like. I really do.
Amy,Then why are we drinking?
Amy,"Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me."
Amy,Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
Amy,He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.
Amy,Hi. How are you doing?
Amy,"So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject."
Amy,"Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could."
Amy,"Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?"
Amy,Sheldon?
Amy,I’m sorry I brought it up.
Amy,But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
Amy,Can you please just tell me why?
Amy,I’m sorry.
Amy,You realize none of those things would happen now?
Amy,"Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour."
Amy,"Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?"
Amy,"Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
Amy,"Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit."
Amy,"Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
Amy,Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?
Amy,Are you all right?
Amy,"Oh, do you need a minute?"
Amy,"Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?"
Amy,"Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on."
Amy,"Well, he’s seen me without pants on."
Amy,"If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born."
Amy,"Hey, everybody, listen up."
Amy,We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
Amy,"So, have you been having any morning sickness?"
Amy,See what?
Amy,Why wouldn’t you open it?
Amy,"She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound."
Amy,What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
Amy,You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
Amy,"Ooh, let’s find out."
Amy,"Oh, my."
Amy,These things go for five hundred dollars and up.
Amy,Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?
Amy,"Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math."
Amy,I hope everything’s okay.
Amy,And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Amy,You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me.
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,I didn’t understand your e-mail.
Amy,"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
Amy,"Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date."
Amy,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
Amy,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
Amy,Get a new computer.
Amy,Get a new computer.
Amy,I got here as quickly as I could.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly."
Amy,That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
Amy,"Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer."
Amy,Do what?
Amy,"Well, the guy at the store said this one is great."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
Amy,Whatch me.
Amy,I thought you might like it.
Amy,Or you could just look into my eyes.
Amy,"Well, you know, as long as you’re happy."
Amy,And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
Amy,"Oh, but he said you can get store credit."
Amy,But why wouldn’t…
Amy,Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
Amy,"Sheldon, just tell me."
Amy,Okay.
Amy,All right.
Amy,"Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?"
Amy,Will you please tell me where we’re going?
Amy,I’m driving the car. I need to know.
Amy,So where are we going?
Amy,Why do you have a storage unit?
Amy,How long have you had it?
Amy,Do you want me to hold that computer?
Amy,"I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?"
Amy,All of it?
Amy,"Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute."
Amy,You have sporting equipment?
Amy,"Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?"
Amy,"So, why do you feel you need to save these things?"
Amy,Okay. I get it. I get it.
Amy,I don’t.
Amy,Why?
Amy,"It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too."
Amy,"Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?"
Amy,It’s not a contest.
Amy,"So, no one else knows about this?"
Amy,Thank you for trusting me.
Amy,"That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you."
Amy,"Baby steps, I guess."
Amy,Oh. Okay.
Amy,You did it. Do you feel okay?
Amy,"Well, I’m proud of you."
Amy,"Well, I feel closer to you now."
Amy,What did you have in mind?
Amy,"And yet, I’m not."
Amy,"And yet, you can’t."
Amy,Here’s your tea.
Amy,"You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?"
Amy,We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them."
Amy,"You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you."
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Yay.
Amy,Have you ever been off the grid before?
Amy,"Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car."
Amy,"On the other hand, safety first."
Amy,"Wow, it’s really coming down."
Amy,So what do we do now?
Amy,"Ooh, that sounds cozy."
Amy,What’s the game?
Amy,She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.
Amy,"No, it’s only if you’ve done it."
Amy,I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
Amy,I’m surprised you would do that.
Amy,"Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed."
Amy,You know the rules. Drink.
Amy,Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
Amy,Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
Amy,Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
Amy,"Well, we all have a past."
Amy,I brought my famous spinach dip.
Amy,What’s going on with him?
Amy,"Well, I get why he’s annoyed."
Amy,"Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."
Amy,Do you guys want to watch with us?
Amy,"You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
Amy,"Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less."
Amy,"Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are."
Amy,Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
Amy,Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
Amy,Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
Amy,Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
Amy,Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,How?
Amy,That was scary.
Amy,But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
Amy,"Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go."
Amy,"Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now."
Amy,And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
Amy,And now you know why I needed the massage.
Amy,"Oh, we’re the first ones here."
Amy,Yeah. Cool.
Amy,"Oh, I do. It was three years ago."
Amy,"So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out."
Amy,I don’t know. I really don’t know.
Amy,"Oh, thank God."
Amy,But yes.
Amy,"Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?"
Amy,Are you gonna say hi to him?
Amy,I’m getting an earthy note.
Amy,Hello.
Amy,Mike deGrasse Tyson?
Amy,It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
Amy,How do you know that?
Amy,"So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you."
Amy,"Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them."
Amy,You just did.
Amy,What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.
Amy,Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
Amy,We’re not going shopping together.
Amy,Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
Amy,"You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?"
Amy,"I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on."
Amy,I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
Amy,Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
Amy,"Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door."
Amy,"Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk."
Amy,Come in.
Amy,Fine.
Amy,"Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way."
Amy,"Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut."
Amy,I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.
Amy,So there’s no maid of honour?
Amy,"Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?"
Amy,Then I graciously accept.
Amy,"Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?"
Amy,"My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper."
Amy,"Okay, Mary."
Amy,It sure was.
Amy,"Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow."
Amy,"You’ve met her, right?"
Amy,I think I can see my breath.
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,Hi.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,Play with your phone.
Amy,Do you realize what’s happening here?
Amy,What took you guys so long?
Amy,I’d be lost without you.
Amy,Back to your phone.
Amy,"Hear, hear."
Amy,Who’s ready for a wedding?
Amy,Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
Amy,"Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off."
Amy,It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
Amy,It’s happening.
Amy,You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
Amy,I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Amy,Does that help?
Amy,What’s wrong?
Amy,"You did already know, right?"
Amy,Why don’t you want anyone to know?
Amy,Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
Amy,"Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you."
Amy,What?
Amy,"Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
Amy,"I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up."
Amy,I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
Amy,"Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner."
Amy,I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
Amy,"Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?"
Amy,You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
Amy,I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
Amy,I understand how you feel.
Amy,I wish there were some way I could make it better.
Amy,"Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant."
Amy,I’ll be right back.
Amy,"Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
Amy,"Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening."
Amy,"Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry."
Amy,"Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny."
Amy,Bert’s a geologist. 
Amy,"Oh, actually, we’re an hour late."
Amy,I don’t know where everyone is.
Amy,Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
Amy,No.
Amy,I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.
Amy,Just the right idea at the right time.
Amy,And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
Amy,"Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart."
Amy,"Thank you so much, Bert. This was great."
Amy,I think we’re good.
Amy,Bye.
Amy,"And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
Amy,About five weeks.
Amy,"Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
Amy,They didn’t say.
Amy,Really?
Amy,You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
Amy,"So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?"
Amy,"Oh, my, this is a big step."
Amy,What do you think?
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
Amy,"So, is that a yes?"
Amy,"Sheldon, what do you think?"
Amy,Seriously?
Amy,Oh. This is so exciting.
Amy,You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?
Amy,I don’t know. I didn’t count.
Amy,"That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?"
Amy,"Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
Amy,"Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. "
Amy,"Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it."
Amy,"I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too."
Amy,Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Shall we?
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon."
Amy,"Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
Amy,Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.
Amy,"Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
Amy,"Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate."
Amy,"Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
Amy,Great. That’s your side.
Amy,"Okay, I’ll take that side."
Amy,Rising rapidly.
Amy,Okay. What if we do this?
Amy,Great.
Amy,Comfy?
Amy,"Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall."
Amy,"Oh, oh, oh."
Amy,Hang on.
Amy,I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.
Amy,It’s not what you think.
Amy,I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
Amy,Miserable and exhausted.
Amy,"Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault."
Amy,"Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
Amy,The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
Amy,"I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
Amy,"What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
Amy,"Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable."
Amy,Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
Amy,"Well, for science, maybe I will."
Amy,Fine.
Amy,Good.
Amy,Do you want to go to our place and make out?
Amy,"I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives."
Amy,I’m sorry for bringing this over here. 
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
Amy,"Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
Amy,What?
Amy,We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
Amy,You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
Amy,Why is nothing easy with him?
Amy,I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
Amy,I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
Amy,That’s true.
Amy,You’re not making me feel better.
Amy,"He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap."
Amy,Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
Amy,But you did.
Amy,It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
Amy,Me.
Amy,Me. It was mittens.
Amy,"That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand."
Amy,"You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself."
Amy,"And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here."
Amy,"It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…"
Amy,"Oh, hi. Hi."
Amy,Oh. Really?
Amy,I would love to.
Amy,"You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over."
Amy,You know what I meant.
Amy,I’m sorry I mentioned it.
Amy,What’s going on here?
Amy,"Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?"
Amy,You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
Amy,That’s an odd mix of people.
Amy,You never went into that haunted house.
Amy,"Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise."
Amy,"Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have"
Amy,"There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon."
Amy,Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.
Amy,How old was it
Amy,"Hi, Stuart."
Amy,"Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you."
Amy,Things didn’t work out?
Amy,"Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
Amy,"Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people."
Amy,"No, Stuart, don’t."
Amy,We’re so sorry.
Amy,Cheers.
Amy,Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
Amy,And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Amy,"As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band. "
Amy,We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
Amy,"So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis."
Amy,Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
Amy,It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
Amy,"Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone."
Amy,"Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
Amy,"Anyway, how about dinner?"
Amy,"Thanks, but you don’t have to."
Amy,"Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?"
Amy,"No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
Amy,"Um, it was a drywall problem."
Amy,"Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…"
Amy,"Or damp wall, just as bad."
Amy,"Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…"
Amy,"I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go."
Amy,"Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this."
Amy,Thanks.
Amy,Let it go.
Amy,Food’s here.
Amy,"Oh, uh, they’re still working on it."
Amy,Why are you speaking Klingon?
Amy,"This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?"
Amy,Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
Amy,You stop that.
Amy,Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
Amy,Everybody stop it with that.
Amy,And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
Amy,I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.
Amy,Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
Amy,Whatever.
Amy,Thank you for understanding.
Amy,Good night.
Amy,"I don’t know. It, it could be. "
Amy,"Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
Amy,"Sorry, you brought it up?"
Amy,It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,What’s going on?
Amy,Can it be more of an internal struggle?
Amy,How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
Amy,What is happening?
Amy,Hi.
Amy,What are you doing?
Amy,I understand. I’ll leave you be.
Amy,Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
Amy,"Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant."
Amy,"You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle."
Amy,"Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
Amy,"Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian."
Amy,It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
Amy,A two.
Amy,"Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
Amy,"Okay. Three, two, and we’re done."
Amy,"It didn’t hurt, did it?"
Amy,"Okay, fine, one."
Amy,"If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you."
Amy,"Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
Amy,These cells come from both of us.
Amy,No reason we can’t start right now.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do."
Amy,"You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
Amy,"Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit."
Amy,"So, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
Amy,"Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
Amy,"Sheldon, that’s enough."
Amy,I’ve never seen results like this before.
Amy,Aren’t you glad you participated in this?
Amy,Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Amy,Make a baby? What are you talking about?
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby."
Amy,"Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
Amy,Not right now.
Amy,I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.
Amy,No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
Amy,"Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything."
Amy,"Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man. "
Amy,Hello.
Amy,I don’t think so.
Amy,"Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
Amy,I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
Amy,"Okay, I’ve had enough."
Amy,It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
Amy,No. 
Amy,"For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous."
Amy,That was a close one.
Amy,Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning."
Amy,"Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy."
Amy,Sounds like the night we had coitus.
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit."
Amy,What happened?
Amy,"You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop."
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head."
Amy,Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
Amy,Really?
Amy,What’s up?
Amy,Yep.
Amy,I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
Amy,What about me and Sheldon?
Amy,"Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks."
Amy,That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
Amy,"You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
Amy,How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?
Amy,Way ahead of you.
Amy,"If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
Amy,"Great, what’d you have in mind?"
Amy,"Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around."
Amy,"Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
Amy,"Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody."
Amy,It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
Amy,I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
Amy,"Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
Amy,And you.
Amy,To give to you.
Amy,So do you.
Amy,Thank you?
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?"
Amy,"I don’t think you do, but all right."
Amy,I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
Amy,"I think he might be right. Also, who is that?"
Amy,"So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay."
Amy,What’s wrong?
Amy,"Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning."
Amy,I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
Amy,I love it. Thank you.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,Is that okay?
Amy,"You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery."
Amy,"I guess, I guess we should stop."
Amy,Just don’t smoke.
Amy,"Well, first deliveries can be slow."
Amy,"Well, should we, uh, head back up?"
Amy,"Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
Amy,Uh.
Amy,Well.
Amy,"So, where were we?"
Amy,I’m sorry.
Amy,"Well, shall we start over?"
Amy,What’s wrong?
Amy,"Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush."
Amy,And the mood continues to change.
Amy,Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
Amy,No.
Amy,It’s not about trains.
Amy,Stop talking about trains.
Amy,"One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter."
Amy,I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
Amy,I did. Am I in trouble?
Amy,"Wait, what just happened?"
Amy,"Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
Amy,Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
Amy,Is this about the baby?
Amy,Good. Then you’re used to this.
Amy,You have got to be kidding me.
Amy,"I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?"
Amy,"Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie."
Amy,Sheldon and I are living together.
Amy,Bernadette got her doctorate.
Amy,We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.
Amy,How’s Bernadette?
Amy,"That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking."
Amy,Kind of hard to see the names.
Amy,They all look the same to me.
Amy,"Well, that was quite a day."
Amy,I was afraid you’d be too tired.
Amy,Hi.
Amy,It was not a great trip.
Amy,"I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
Amy,"So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together."
Amy,Maybe there won’t be one.
Amy,"Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it."
Amy,"Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
Amy,"Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby."
Amy,"They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
Amy,"Sheldon, don’t overreact."
Amy,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Amy,I’ll take over from here.
Amy,He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
Amy,Are you going to?
Amy,"Sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
Amy,"We’re ignoring the fins, okay."
Amy,I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
Amy,That’s exactly what she was saying.
Amy,"Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while."
Amy,"You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone."
Amy,What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
Amy,"Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
Amy,She was gonna find out eventually.
Amy,"Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were."
Amy,"This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you."
Amy,That’s right. 
Amy,"Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you."
Amy,Have you? How am I feeling right now?
Amy,"You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
Amy,Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
Amy,Do you need help?
Amy,Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
Amy,Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,"That was fun, thank you."
Amy,"Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?"
Amy,But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
Amy,"Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him."
Amy,Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
Amy,"Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out. "
Amy,I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
Amy,I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower. 
Amy,"Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon."
Amy,Bye.
Amy,Bye.
Amy,I’ll miss you.
Amy,I’ll miss you more. 
Amy,"If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…"
Amy,"Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
Amy,"I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
Amy,Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
Amy,"Nice to see you, too."
Amy,"Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?"
Amy,Uh-huh.
Amy,It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.
Amy,It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.
Amy,I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
Amy,"Right, right. Got it."
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Amy,I’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.
Amy,And also a little sad.
Amy,What do you think?
Amy,It’s amazing a machine can do that.
Amy,"All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
Amy,"Okay, I’m looking at the first picture."
Amy,Yes. I’m looking at puppi
Amy,Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?
Amy,Yes. I’m looking at a picture of my grandma.
Amy,Yes.
Amy,What’s that? Are you working on your resume?
Amy,Stop enjoying their fight.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go."
Amy,I think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.
Amy,"Sheldon, dinner’s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?"
Amy,What’s going on?
Amy,I’m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.
Amy,"Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
Amy,"Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell."
Amy,"No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I’m proud of you, for reasons I’m sure have something to do with my father. And if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are."
Amy,It’s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
Amy,"Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?"
Amy,Is there anything we can do?
Amy,"Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir."
Amy,Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.
Amy,"Hey, you’re home early."
Amy,Wow. He finally used it. What’d you do?
Amy,"Well, I’m really happy for you."
Amy,I give up.
Amy,No. I really give up.
Amy,Can I pee now?
Amy,"Well, the bra under here ain’t beige."
Amy,"Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?"
Amy,Nothing says fun like being scolded.
Amy,"Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?"
Amy,"Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
Amy,You sure? They’re open till dos.
Amy,"I’m not sad. I mean, hello."
Amy,What are you sad about?
Amy,What feelings?
Amy,Come on. You’ve got so much to feel good about. You’ve got a great job now.
Amy,You make more than I do.
Amy,It’s bigger than mine.
Amy,"I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
Amy,I’m sorry. I can’t help it.
Amy,It is warm in here.
Amy,"Me, too."
Amy,I can get us there in two.
Amy,"Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night."
Amy,"Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun."
Amy,Oh. Immature.
Amy,The food here’s supposed to be great. Don’t fill up on chips.
Amy,"Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi."
Amy,Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
Amy,"Sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
Amy,"Hi, Bert."
Amy,"Oh, we’re having date night."
Amy,"Oh, really. Anybody we know?"
Amy,That’s a real thing?
Amy,"Sorry, I don’t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss."
Amy,"Oh, no. Are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?"
Amy,I’m so sorry.
Amy,Fine with me.
Amy,"Sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
Amy,So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?
Amy,"Okay, literally any other topic."
Amy,Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Amy,You-you know about that?
Amy,Were you aware of this?
Amy,Because I’m mad at you.
Amy,"Sheldon, it’s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
Amy,That’s why they’re doing it.
Amy,I’m going to bed.
Amy,So?
Amy,I’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.
Amy,"That’s different. She’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
Amy,Yeah?
Amy,What is this?
Amy,Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
Amy,"Well, I do appreciate you working on this."
Amy,What’s that little dot in the middle?
Amy,Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?
Amy,Can I hear one?
Amy,Why? Are they naughty?
Amy,Please?
Amy,What? Why didn’t you say anything?
Amy,"So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?"
Amy,You’re actually going to Comic-Con?
Amy,"Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun."
Amy,"No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to."
Amy,My aunt’s funeral?
Amy,"Well, I’m not going, but I do think it’s nice you want to."
Amy,"Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here."
Amy,Comic-Con’s five days.
Amy,Why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?
Amy,He is an indoor cat.
Amy,Penny says they’re ready to go.
Amy,"Sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying."
Amy,"Wait, wait, wait, what’s Leonard lying about?"
Amy,Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy.
Amy,"No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it."
Amy,Because it’s between them. 
Amy,Hi. 
Amy,Shh.
Amy,"Sure, happy to."
Amy,Because you don’t want her to go to Comic-Con.
Amy,"Oh, my God, stop talking."
Amy,The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?
Amy,So you’re not going to Comic-Con?
Amy,Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?
Amy,By yourself?
Amy,I’m not going with you to Comic-Con.
Amy,"He can, but it’s still not changing my mind."
Amy,"No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue."
Amy,"For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues."
Amy,Hi.
Amy,"Well, Sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland."
Amy,Don’t listen to them. What’s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.
Amy,"But you are, aren’t you?"
Amy,Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.
Amy,"There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
Amy,And there is the love of which I speak.
Amy,"Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
Amy,You ready to go?
Amy,What’s that?
Amy,"Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
Amy,No. I already asked.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,Sheldon.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place."
Amy,Just keep walking.
Amy,And don’t start thinking about it now.
Amy,That’s not true.
Amy,This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.
Amy,You okay?
Amy,What’s wrong?
Amy,Is that bothering you?
Amy,"I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
Amy,I don’t know. I just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.
Amy,You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It’s not a good influence.
Amy,"I want to say aw, but I’m gonna say ew."
Amy,"Yup, we’re killin’ it."
Amy,That’s great. How so?
Amy,Why don’t you ask me what I’m working on?
Amy,I’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.
Amy,"Yes, I’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
Amy,"You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something."
Amy,"You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?"
Amy,"Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
Amy,"Sheldon, this is really interesting."
Amy,"You know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
Amy,"Well, that would make me feel better."
Amy,That’s a ridiculous rule.
Amy,"Oh, good. What are they?"
Amy,Can I see that?
Amy,"Sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, I’ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules."
Amy,Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
Amy,"Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition."
Amy,"Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid."
Amy,Are you listening?
Amy,"Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
Amy,"Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?"
Amy,Wow. Look at that.
Amy,"So we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage."
Amy,I don’t know where we went wrong.
Amy,"Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it."
Amy,"I can hear your face talking, so we’re even."
Amy,"Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?"
Amy,"You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea."
Amy,That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.
Amy,"I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
Amy,"Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
Amy,We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.
Amy,I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.
Amy,"How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero."
Amy,There’s only one clear choice.
Amy,"No, you bonehead."
Amy,"Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
Amy,"Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
Amy,"Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
Amy,Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?
Amy,"Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
Amy,"Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
Amy,Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
Amy,But you said you were working with me.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly. You can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
Amy,"Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong."
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed."
Amy,"It’s okay, now I don’t need butter."
Amy,You need sleep.
Amy,"Well, I don’t want your germs around me."
Amy,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Amy,"It’s okay, I’m sure we’ll find it."
Amy,Maybe it’s wherever your pants are.
Amy,"I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?"
Amy,You really can’t remember anything?
Amy,Phones can do that?
Amy,You’re welcome. How is it?
Amy,Do you need anything else?
Amy,"Fine. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Amy,"Weiches Kätzchen, warmes Kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes Kätzchen, müdes Kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt."
Amy,Sings in Mandarin. *
Amy,And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Amy,"Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began. "
Amy,Could have played that on my harp.
Amy,Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.
Amy,"And don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying.  Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags."
Amy,And what does that have to do with flags?
Amy,"Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller."
Amy,I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
Amy,It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food.
Amy,Get your food.
Amy,Go.
Amy,And don’t you slam that door.
Amy,I was wrong. You can come back in.
Amy,"I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?"
Amy,What are you looking at?
Amy,"Oh. You know, good for you."
Amy,"You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now."
Amy,Relax. We’re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.
Amy,And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Amy,"So welcome to tonight’s episode, "
Amy,"Oh. Hello, you’re on Fun with Flags."
Amy,"I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check."
Amy,To denial.
Amy,Hey.
Amy,What smells so good?
Amy,Is this part of your super-aging?
Amy,"Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
Amy,How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?
Amy,Where did you get it?
Amy,Have you tried letting go of the rope?
Amy,"All right, well, have fun."
Amy,"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Amy,What are you doing?
Amy,"Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?"
Amy,"You said juggling was dumb, too."
Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
Amy,"Well, if you honestly…"
Amy,"His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me."
Amy,I made you tea.
Amy,I’m sorry I called you a quitter.
Amy,What are you reading?
Amy,So?
Amy,"That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you."
Amy,"Well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
Amy,"Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?"
Amy,So many warnings.
Amy,"You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
Amy,Where are you moving?
Amy,"Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself."
Amy,"I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton."
Amy,"Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that."
Amy,You really believe that?
Amy,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry."
Amy,"Yeah, um, Raj is moving out."
Amy,"No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood."
Amy,"I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go."
Amy,I guess. And he’ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.
Amy,Got to go. Morning.
Amy,Are you feeling okay?
Amy,"Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
Amy,"Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
Amy,"No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you."
Amy,"Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
Amy,"Sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly."
Amy,"You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new."
Amy,"Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks."
Amy,"That is true, I have said that."
Amy,I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.
Amy,"Yeah, that’s the one."
Amy,"Well, I haven’t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first."
Amy,So are you.
Amy,"Are, are you sure?"
Amy,I don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.
Amy,Guys.
Amy,I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.
Amy,Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…
Amy,"I know, but what if Sheldon…"
Amy,"Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
Amy,"All right, so you know."
Amy,Hey. You going somewhere?
Amy,"Sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,Does this mean you’re okay with me going?
Amy,I am.
Amy,I wasn’t thinking that.
Amy,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
Amy,What if we don’t fold our clothes at all?
Amy,"Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?"
Amy,Is it?
Amy,Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
Amy,I’ll love you no matter what.
Amy,We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Amy,I will.
Amy,Uh-huh.
Amy,"I don’t know what they look like, but sure."
Amy,I won’t.
Amy,Got it.
Amy,Good thinking.
Amy,Thank you. That means a lot.
Amy,Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus.
Amy,"Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?"
Amy,I miss you.
Amy,"It’s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
Amy,"In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you."
Amy,Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?
Amy,What are you gonna do about it?
Amy,Vigorously?
Amy,Sounds like a big night.
Amy,So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?
Amy,Who’s he?
Amy,"Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?"
Amy,"Huge fan, you say?"
Amy,That’s terrific. I’ll call you right back.
Amy,I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?
Amy,Why didn’t you tell me?
Amy,Should I worry?
Amy,"That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
Amy,You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.
Amy,"I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
Amy,"Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer."
Amy,Nice try.
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Amy,I was missing you again.
Amy,She’s what?
Amy,Hi.
Amy,"Uh-huh. Hang on.  Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry."
Amy,It’s not important.
Amy,May I offer an observation?
Amy,Amy Farrah Fowler.
Amy,Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
Amy,"So, what do you think?"
Amy,"Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you’ve made a foolish mistake."
Amy,"What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
Amy,"Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory."
Amy,Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
Amy,"I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it."
Amy,I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
Amy,"Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes."
Amy,"Guys, something happened."
Amy,"You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
Amy,"Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends."
Amy,"This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
Amy,"You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine."
Amy,What?
Amy,"Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it."
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Amy,That’s right. They’re no good without the lighter.
Amy,We’re here.
Amy,"Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. "
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?"
Amy,"Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?"
Amy,"How’s it going, Sheldon?"
Amy,"How’s it going, Sheldon?"
Amy,"Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye."
Amy,"Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?"
Amy,"Hey, girl."
Amy,You guys doing okay down there?
Amy,You guys doing okay down there?
Amy,"Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?"
Amy,"Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?"
Amy,"Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
Amy,Hello.
Amy,"Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again."
Amy,How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
Amy,Hi.
Amy,"I’m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon."
Amy,"Huh. Well, this is weird."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?"
Amy,"Sheldon, what’s wrong?"
Amy,"It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?"
Amy,I miss you.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?"
Amy,"We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?"
Amy,My first love broke my heart for the first time.
Amy,I didn’t understand your e-mail.
Amy,I really had to go home for this?
Amy,"Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry."
Amy,Sorry.
Amy,"My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
Bernadette,That works.
Bernadette,Strike two.
Bernadette,"Oh, Raj, you’re our guest."
Bernadette,"Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?"
Bernadette,"Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news."
Bernadette,To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
Bernadette,Microbiology.
Bernadette,I don’t understand.
Bernadette,"I know, I’m studying it."
Bernadette,Are you sure?
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,Not really.
Bernadette,I use them. I don’t like them.
Bernadette,A puppy once bit my face.
Bernadette,Are you going to answer it?
Bernadette,I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?"
Bernadette,"Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?"
Bernadette,No. That’s the sad part.
Bernadette,That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Bernadette,Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
Bernadette,Oh!
Bernadette,I’d love some.
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,"Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke."
Bernadette,I don’t really get it.
Bernadette,Can I ask you a question?
Bernadette,Where do you think this is going?
Bernadette,You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.
Bernadette,"Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish."
Bernadette,"Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
Bernadette,Sex.
Bernadette,But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
Bernadette,Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Bernadette,Call me when you figure it out.
Bernadette,"Hello, Howard."
Bernadette,"I can’t now, I’m working."
Bernadette,Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?
Bernadette,"So, this isn’t a joke?"
Bernadette,Then you’re insane.
Bernadette,"Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet."
Bernadette,Wow. 
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Bernadette,"Oh, now what?"
Bernadette,"No, that’s okay."
Bernadette,Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
Bernadette,I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,Why not?
Bernadette,He can’t sit somewhere else?
Bernadette,"Ooh, I love your shoes."
Bernadette,Where’d you get them?
Bernadette,I’ve been meaning to go over there.
Bernadette,"Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
Bernadette,"Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh."
Bernadette,"So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
Bernadette,"Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing."
Bernadette,That’s amazing.
Bernadette,Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast."
Bernadette,Who are all those people?
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.
Bernadette,"So, how’s your experiment going?"
Bernadette,"Boy, I’d love to see that."
Bernadette,"Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?"
Bernadette,Do they have that?
Bernadette,"Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me."
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,Howard?
Bernadette,It unhooks in the front.
Bernadette,I guess I should go.
Bernadette,"You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?"
Bernadette,He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
Bernadette,"You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?"
Bernadette,Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
Bernadette,"Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi."
Bernadette,What are you doing here?
Bernadette,"No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid."
Bernadette,"No, Leonard, you should hear this."
Bernadette,"What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?"
Bernadette,"Come here, tushy face."
Bernadette,"Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
Bernadette,"Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?"
Bernadette,"How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?"
Bernadette,I’m sliding into third.
Bernadette,"So, what should we talk about?"
Bernadette,"No, thank you."
Bernadette,Really uncomfortable.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
Bernadette,"I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
Bernadette,When Howard tried to do the splits…
Bernadette,With marbles?
Bernadette,"Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
Bernadette,"Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?"
Bernadette,Which leads to…?
Bernadette,"Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
Bernadette,I’m going to count to three. One…
Bernadette,I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
Bernadette,"Thanks, Sheldon."
Bernadette,"Hi, guys."
Bernadette,I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
Bernadette,"Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now."
Bernadette,What’s George Takei doing here?
Bernadette,She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
Bernadette,"Sorry, I had to clock out."
Bernadette,"Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?"
Bernadette,Too bad.
Bernadette,"Well, to be honest, I…"
Bernadette,I’m okay.
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,"No, it’s fine."
Bernadette,"What about you, have you been seeing anybody?"
Bernadette,So you’ve been seeing other girls?
Bernadette,Does that mean slutty trolls?
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,I know. I work here.
Bernadette,"Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out."
Bernadette,Had sex?
Bernadette,"Well, whose fault was that?"
Bernadette,"Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move."
Bernadette,"Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move."
Bernadette,Really.
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,Mm! What are you doing?
Bernadette,"Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again."
Bernadette,"Be patient, we’ll get there."
Bernadette,"Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold."
Bernadette,"We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing."
Bernadette,"Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy."
Bernadette,Isn’t she a pip?
Bernadette,I’ll go with you.
Bernadette,Knock-knock.
Bernadette,Olive.
Bernadette,"Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight."
Bernadette,"Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk."
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny."
Bernadette,You are?
Bernadette,"Penny, your nails look great."
Bernadette,Or we could just stay here.
Bernadette,"Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is."
Bernadette,"Oh, you never were?"
Bernadette,You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.
Bernadette,"No, just the one. But it’s really long."
Bernadette,Truth.
Bernadette,Um.
Bernadette,I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
Bernadette,"Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?"
Bernadette,Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,She’s been in there a long time.
Bernadette,"Ooh, like what?"
Bernadette,Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
Bernadette,I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
Bernadette,Knock-knock.
Bernadette,So where’s the telescope?
Bernadette,"So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?"
Bernadette,Here we go.
Bernadette,"Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead."
Bernadette,"Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands."
Bernadette,"It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
Bernadette,"Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?"
Bernadette,Which is still so funny.
Bernadette,"Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."
Bernadette,"Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!"
Bernadette,"Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
Bernadette,That sounds great.
Bernadette,"He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?"
Bernadette,"Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you."
Bernadette,You just have to look.
Bernadette,"Well, this was fun."
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery."
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,He’s really cute. How do you know him?
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
Bernadette,It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
Bernadette,What’s the matter?
Bernadette,I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
Bernadette,"Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"
Bernadette,Really? And miss the keynote?
Bernadette,"Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?"
Bernadette,"Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard."
Bernadette,"Oh. Thank you, Raj."
Bernadette,"Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Glenn!"
Bernadette,Are you here for the conference?
Bernadette,"Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard."
Bernadette,I’ll try to catch it.
Bernadette,Bye.
Bernadette,Yeah?
Bernadette,No. He was one of my professors in college.
Bernadette,"Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap."
Bernadette,Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
Bernadette,Six-seven.
Bernadette,Is something bothering you?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you."
Bernadette,You can’t think that way.
Bernadette,"Howard, stop it."
Bernadette,"Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?"
Bernadette,Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
Bernadette,I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
Bernadette,Can I stay here tonight?
Bernadette,Howard’s a complete and total ass.
Bernadette,Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
Bernadette,"Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
Bernadette,I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
Bernadette,"Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic."
Bernadette,"Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny."
Bernadette,Are you guys doing okay?
Bernadette,"Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie."
Bernadette,Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
Bernadette,Yeah. You’re a hottie.
Bernadette,I have to stay here for school.
Bernadette,"Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
Bernadette,What do you say?
Bernadette,Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?
Bernadette,They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.
Bernadette,Sexually.
Bernadette,That’s how I heard it.
Bernadette,"Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours."
Bernadette,Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
Bernadette,It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Bernadette,That’s how I take it.
Bernadette,Me too.
Bernadette,Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
Bernadette,"Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself."
Bernadette,"It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap."
Bernadette,Stay.
Bernadette,Go home.
Bernadette,"Howard, have you ever considered us living together?"
Bernadette,"No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place."
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,Great.
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,"That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?"
Bernadette,"No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother."
Bernadette,Wrong answer.
Bernadette,I’m listening.
Bernadette,Agh!
Bernadette,Really?
Bernadette,What did she say when you told her?
Bernadette,"This is so great. I love you, Howard."
Bernadette,"Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house."
Bernadette,Wow.
Bernadette,I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"No. I, I might have some cheddar."
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
Bernadette,I have to take you?
Bernadette,Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
Bernadette,I can’t believe this.
Bernadette,"All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother."
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
Bernadette,"We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing."
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,We were hoping you’d know a place.
Bernadette,"But you could if you wanted to, right?"
Bernadette,"Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?"
Bernadette,I would take that deal all day long.
Bernadette,What’s that?
Bernadette,"Oh, God, that is so romantic."
Bernadette,Leonard’s really one of a kind.
Bernadette,That’s kind of creepy.
Bernadette,"I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information."
Bernadette,I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
Bernadette,Oh. That bitch!
Bernadette,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again."
Bernadette,I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
Bernadette,Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.
Bernadette,"Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?"
Bernadette,"Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?"
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Bernadette,"Oh, God. What’s happening?"
Bernadette,"Howard, let me just stop you right here."
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,"Yes, I will marry you."
Bernadette,I will. I will!
Bernadette,"Oh, I love you, too."
Bernadette,Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
Bernadette,"Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?"
Bernadette,Whee-ee-ee!
Bernadette,I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
Bernadette,Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
Bernadette,That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
Bernadette,"Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
Bernadette,"Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
Bernadette,"Muy caliente, Sheldon!"
Bernadette,"Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged."
Bernadette,"Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before."
Bernadette,Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
Bernadette,We’re really not that close.
Bernadette,Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
Bernadette,You think?
Bernadette,"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Bernadette,It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
Bernadette,I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
Bernadette,I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
Bernadette,I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
Bernadette,That’s what I hear.
Bernadette,She’s also dating an astronaut.
Bernadette,"Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too."
Bernadette,I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
Bernadette,"Obviously, this one doesn’t."
Bernadette,"Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!"
Bernadette,"You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
Bernadette,"Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?"
Bernadette,He’s a consultant.
Bernadette,"He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?"
Bernadette,In the bathroom.
Bernadette,They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
Bernadette,I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
Bernadette,They said something about going there this summer.
Bernadette,I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
Bernadette,You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s hysterical."
Bernadette,I don’t want to do this anymore!
Bernadette,Let me help you.
Bernadette,This trip to India sounds fun.
Bernadette,Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
Bernadette,"Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
Bernadette,Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
Bernadette,Yes. Are you writing a book?
Bernadette,I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
Bernadette,I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! 
Bernadette,You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
Bernadette,Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
Bernadette,I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
Bernadette,You guys ready to order?
Bernadette,I don’t understand.
Bernadette,"All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya."
Bernadette,That’s what you ordered.
Bernadette,Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
Bernadette,He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
Bernadette,"You’re a real hero, Howard."
Bernadette,So it’s probably genetic.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me."
Bernadette,You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
Bernadette,You mean sexual intercourse?
Bernadette,Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
Bernadette,How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
Bernadette,Me? Why me?
Bernadette,"Okay, well, wish me luck."
Bernadette,You’re a putz. You know what that means?
Bernadette,Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
Bernadette,"No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack."
Bernadette,Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
Bernadette,"Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news."
Bernadette,The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,"Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
Bernadette,"Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present."
Bernadette,"I wanted to. Come on, open it."
Bernadette,"Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things."
Bernadette,You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!
Bernadette,What the hell is wrong with you?
Bernadette,I’m nice to everyone.
Bernadette,"Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us."
Bernadette,What?!
Bernadette,Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
Bernadette,It’s okay if he wants to come.
Bernadette,"What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?"
Bernadette,That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
Bernadette,Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
Bernadette,Is she moving out?
Bernadette,Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
Bernadette,"I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever."
Bernadette,"Raj, take me home."
Bernadette,Take me home now.
Bernadette,Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
Bernadette,And your mom would be okay with that?
Bernadette,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
Bernadette,"I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz."
Bernadette,"Oh, God."
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,"No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
Bernadette,"No, it’s not. I’m not going in there."
Bernadette,"Good morning, handsome."
Bernadette,It’s me.
Bernadette,Your mom and I made you breakfast.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky."
Bernadette,It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
Bernadette,He wants butter!
Bernadette,I just told him that!
Bernadette,"If you want butter, I’ll get you butter."
Bernadette,We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
Bernadette,"You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
Bernadette,"Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group."
Bernadette,"Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!"
Bernadette,Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
Bernadette,Are those Russian rockets safe?
Bernadette,Fine. Just a little tired.
Bernadette,I always catch your drift.
Bernadette,I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
Bernadette,"Just stop talking, Howard."
Bernadette,What did you think was going to happen?
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team."
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,"Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,"Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you."
Bernadette,"Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!"
Bernadette,Howard?
Bernadette,"No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
Bernadette,"Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it."
Bernadette,I love you.
Bernadette,Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back. 
Bernadette,I’m ready.
Bernadette,I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
Bernadette,I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.
Bernadette,Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
Bernadette,"Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize."
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"I do, with all my heart."
Bernadette,Can we talk?
Bernadette,All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.
Bernadette,I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
Bernadette,I know.
Bernadette,Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
Bernadette,"I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle."
Bernadette,You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
Bernadette,"Hi, Sheldon."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?"
Bernadette,Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
Bernadette,"This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
Bernadette,"You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot."
Bernadette,Hurry! We’re running out of time!
Bernadette,Just do it!
Bernadette,"Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
Bernadette,Really?
Bernadette,That’s horrible.
Bernadette,I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?
Bernadette,"Oh, me."
Bernadette,That’s so sweet.
Bernadette,I told you that would happen.
Bernadette,"She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
Bernadette,We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Bernadette,"Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about."
Bernadette,"Yes, absolutely fine."
Bernadette,Hello.
Bernadette,We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
Bernadette,"Amy, we’re really sorry."
Bernadette,"Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. . "
Bernadette,"We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right."
Bernadette,Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
Bernadette,"No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour."
Bernadette,So is that a yes?
Bernadette,"We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
Bernadette,I am the bride.
Bernadette,I love it!
Bernadette,"Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!"
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,"I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains."
Bernadette,"Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet."
Bernadette,"Oh, he’s a sweetie."
Bernadette,"Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
Bernadette,I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
Bernadette,I didn’t have any.
Bernadette,"Amy, really? Twister?"
Bernadette,"I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
Bernadette,What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
Bernadette,"Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie."
Bernadette,We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
Bernadette,"Looks like it’s just us playing.  Penny, we’re out of wine!"
Bernadette,I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
Bernadette,"Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully."
Bernadette,"I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
Bernadette,"Worst part was, it was too big."
Bernadette,What about you?
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, that’s awful."
Bernadette,Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
Bernadette,You’re doing great.
Bernadette,"Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now."
Bernadette,You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
Bernadette,Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
Bernadette,What about helping people?
Bernadette,I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
Bernadette,Donated.
Bernadette,Penny.
Bernadette,I don’t feel good about this.
Bernadette,"God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?"
Bernadette,"Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
Bernadette,Did it work?
Bernadette,Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?
Bernadette,"Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant."
Bernadette,"You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids."
Bernadette,"Mmm, yeah, sure."
Bernadette,"Oh, ah, right.  And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
Bernadette,After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
Bernadette,"Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?"
Bernadette,Do you know how to pipe down?
Bernadette,You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
Bernadette,That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
Bernadette,Not him.
Bernadette,I told you I’m not good with kids.
Bernadette,"The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
Bernadette,"Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!"
Bernadette,"I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children."
Bernadette,"Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
Bernadette,Here’s your vest back.
Bernadette,Where?
Bernadette,"I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
Bernadette,"Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
Bernadette,"Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?"
Bernadette,"Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
Bernadette,"Yay, so we’re good."
Bernadette,"You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
Bernadette,Ooh!
Bernadette,Ooh!
Bernadette,"This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them."
Bernadette,"Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?"
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,When did you and Leonard break up?
Bernadette,Why do you think he asked you out again?
Bernadette,Maybe.
Bernadette,Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
Bernadette,"You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network."
Bernadette,Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.
Bernadette,"Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
Bernadette,I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
Bernadette,"Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up."
Bernadette,I’m a very vengeful person.
Bernadette,With access to weaponised smallpox.
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s nice."
Bernadette,Ooh!
Bernadette,What about me and Howard?
Bernadette,Where are you guys going to eat?
Bernadette,"Oh, smells amazing in here."
Bernadette,Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
Bernadette,Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
Bernadette,I don’t know if I want to stay.
Bernadette,He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
Bernadette,"Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
Bernadette,Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
Bernadette,You mean my special day?
Bernadette,If I ever actually ever get married.
Bernadette,"My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
Bernadette,Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
Bernadette,I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.
Bernadette,"I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex."
Bernadette,Are you mad at me?
Bernadette,"So, what are we gonna do?"
Bernadette,"I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though."
Bernadette,"Really? Oh, that’d be so great."
Bernadette,"I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement."
Bernadette,"And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish."
Bernadette,"So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
Bernadette,In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
Bernadette,That is big.
Bernadette,And ugly.
Bernadette,"I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
Bernadette,That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
Bernadette,What will you tell Amy?
Bernadette,Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
Bernadette,"Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting."
Bernadette,"I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
Bernadette,"Good night, real Penny."
Bernadette,"Good night, transvestite Penny."
Bernadette,"Hi, sweetie."
Bernadette,"I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day."
Bernadette,Cool. How do they do that?
Bernadette,You threw up?
Bernadette,That sounds mean.
Bernadette,"Sure, why?"
Bernadette,"Howie, what happened to you?"
Bernadette,Survival training? Is that like camping?
Bernadette,Do you sleep in tents?
Bernadette,Poor baby.
Bernadette,You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
Bernadette,Are you crying?
Bernadette,"Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you."
Bernadette,"Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
Bernadette,Surprise.
Bernadette,"I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
Bernadette,"Oh, I love you."
Bernadette,Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Bernadette,Pew!
Bernadette,"Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match."
Bernadette,"Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple."
Bernadette,I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
Bernadette,"I’m gonna go, too."
Bernadette,I’ll miss you.
Bernadette,"No, I’ll…"
Bernadette,Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
Bernadette,The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
Bernadette,"So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
Bernadette,Hello.
Bernadette,"Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi."
Bernadette,We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
Bernadette,Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. 
Bernadette,Metrosexual my ass.
Bernadette,"Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, that’s terrible."
Bernadette,Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
Bernadette,"If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great."
Bernadette,It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
Bernadette,"No, you have to stop now."
Bernadette,"Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him."
Bernadette,"Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
Bernadette,"Amy, please."
Bernadette,I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.
Bernadette,"Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
Bernadette,Funny. You boys have a nice time?
Bernadette,That’s nice.
Bernadette,"You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway."
Bernadette,"You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!"
Bernadette,Don’t you try and blame this on him.
Bernadette,"Zip it, pervert!"
Bernadette,I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more.
Bernadette,"When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
Bernadette,Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
Bernadette,Why didn’t you tell me
Bernadette,My God! I thought you were my friend. 
Bernadette,"No, leave me alone."
Bernadette,Howie?
Bernadette,"I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls."
Bernadette,No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.
Bernadette,Is there anything else about your past I should know?
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,"Yeah, the wedding’s still on. "
Bernadette,You’re kidding.
Bernadette,"Oh, you’re in a good mood."
Bernadette,What’s so great?
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!"
Bernadette,What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
Bernadette,When?
Bernadette,What? We’re getting married that Sunday.
Bernadette,Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
Bernadette,"No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back."
Bernadette,We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
Bernadette,I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl.
Bernadette,"But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
Bernadette,"Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch."
Bernadette,Give me those damn Pringles.
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God."
Bernadette,This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.
Bernadette,"Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married."
Bernadette,I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
Bernadette,"We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back."
Bernadette,"So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back."
Bernadette,That wasn’t going to be our processional music.
Bernadette,"So, what do you say, Amy?"
Bernadette,Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?
Bernadette,Why wasn’t it a real proposal?
Bernadette,"Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day."
Bernadette,"Oh, no."
Bernadette,I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
Bernadette,"No, isn’t that kind of tacky?"
Bernadette,Are any of them still married?
Bernadette,There’s got to be some place special we could do it.
Bernadette,"Oh, I like that."
Bernadette,"Great, well, who’s it going to be?"
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,"Not now, Dad."
Bernadette,"Here you go? What am I, a football?"
Bernadette,"They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer."
Bernadette,Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
Bernadette,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, it’s happening."
Bernadette,I love that man.
Bernadette,I can. How are you?
Bernadette,Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
Bernadette,It was. Until I found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. Let’s talk about that for a minute.
Bernadette,"You said you told her, but you never did!"
Bernadette,How clear is the image of me on that screen?
Bernadette,Do I look like I feel better?
Bernadette,"Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself."
Bernadette,"Aw, that’s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her."
Bernadette,Was she upset?
Bernadette,Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
Bernadette,"Good night, Rocket Man."
Bernadette,And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
Bernadette,"In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper."
Bernadette,"So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?"
Bernadette,"What about you, Penny?"
Bernadette,Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
Bernadette,But do you think you’ll ever get married?
Bernadette,It doesn’t sound like it.
Bernadette,Do you tell him that?
Bernadette,Are you gonna break up with him?
Bernadette,I had no idea you were unhappy.
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear."
Bernadette,There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?
Bernadette,What’s wrong?
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,"No, what are they doing?"
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Bernadette,Why don’t you stand up to them?
Bernadette,"I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice."
Bernadette,Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
Bernadette,"Oh, sure, you had no choice."
Bernadette,"Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Bernadette,"Nope, this is my proud face."
Bernadette,"Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?"
Bernadette,"Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home."
Bernadette,I got to get back to work. I love you.
Bernadette,What do you want me to do?
Bernadette,"Really, you’re serious? Okay. "
Bernadette,"Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?"
Bernadette,What’s wrong?
Bernadette,Uh-huh.
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there."
Bernadette,You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
Bernadette,"How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?"
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,"Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety."
Bernadette,"Hey, Howie, how you feeling?"
Bernadette,"Howie, stop that. NASA’s watching this! Put your pants back on!"
Bernadette,Waiting for my husband.
Bernadette,He’s coming back from outer space.
Bernadette,"No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!"
Bernadette,I missed you so much.
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s just me."
Bernadette,"No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me.  "
Bernadette,"I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants."
Bernadette,It’s just allergies.
Bernadette,"Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?"
Bernadette,"Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh."
Bernadette,A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
Bernadette,"Now, kiss me. "
Bernadette,I thought you liked Halloween.
Bernadette,Like my husband?
Bernadette,"Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going."
Bernadette,Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.
Bernadette,I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
Bernadette,You could start by taking an interest in his work.
Bernadette,He’s an experimental physicist.
Bernadette,"Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice."
Bernadette,"Okay, we need to talk."
Bernadette,"Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute."
Bernadette,Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
Bernadette,"I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it."
Bernadette,Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
Bernadette,I love you.
Bernadette,How do I look?
Bernadette,"Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?"
Bernadette,What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.
Bernadette,"No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just a really short person from Avatar."
Bernadette,"Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month."
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking."
Bernadette,"Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?"
Bernadette,And Albert Einstein?
Bernadette,"Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?"
Bernadette,"You, out! You are being very rude."
Bernadette,Me? What did I do?
Bernadette,I’m always on your side.
Bernadette,Just what?
Bernadette,Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
Bernadette,"No, I’m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here."
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Bernadette,"Hey, what you watching?"
Bernadette,"So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard’s mom’s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn’t enough. Nothing will ever be enough."
Bernadette,There’s a book under here.
Bernadette,I got it.
Bernadette,I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?
Bernadette,That’s great. I didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.
Bernadette,Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
Bernadette,I just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him.
Bernadette,Good.
Bernadette,Got it.
Bernadette,"Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable."
Bernadette,"No, no!"
Bernadette,"Yeah, doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us."
Bernadette,"Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes."
Bernadette,You ready to go?
Bernadette,I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
Bernadette,50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.
Bernadette,Because we don’t live here.
Bernadette,"Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,Or in the closet. We can decide later.
Bernadette,Kitchen slammed again?
Bernadette,"So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
Bernadette,What’s your excuse this time?
Bernadette,That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
Bernadette,"Howie, you promised you’d move."
Bernadette,I’m starting to think you’re right.
Bernadette,I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?
Bernadette,"Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman."
Bernadette,That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
Bernadette,She’s lucky you were there.
Bernadette,"Aw, crap. Let’s go."
Bernadette,Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
Bernadette,"Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story."
Bernadette,No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
Bernadette,"We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax."
Bernadette,Really? Only five?
Bernadette,"Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?"
Bernadette,Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
Bernadette,I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.
Bernadette,What’s that supposed to mean?
Bernadette,"You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science."
Bernadette,Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
Bernadette,"Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?"
Bernadette,"I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,"
Bernadette,"What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?"
Bernadette,He’s not here. What’s wrong?
Bernadette,"Oh, no. Where was it parked?"
Bernadette,That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?
Bernadette,"Well, that doesn’t make sense, either."
Bernadette,Because I’m the one who had it towed.
Bernadette,"Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?"
Bernadette,Are you okay?!
Bernadette,Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.
Bernadette,Here.
Bernadette,"Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?"
Bernadette,You hit her! What did I do?
Bernadette,You were parked in Howard’s spot.
Bernadette,Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
Bernadette,"Okay, let’s go."
Bernadette,The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
Bernadette,‘Cause I did it!
Bernadette,"You know, I’m kind of glad this happened."
Bernadette,I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.
Bernadette,You could die.
Bernadette,"So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?"
Bernadette,"Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better."
Bernadette,"Howie, I think you’d have fun."
Bernadette,Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
Bernadette,What thing?
Bernadette,"Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing."
Bernadette,How’s the poor thing?
Bernadette,"Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts."
Bernadette,This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
Bernadette,I don’t understand.
Bernadette,So you’ve just been lying to him?
Bernadette,"I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
Bernadette,Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.
Bernadette,You’re an idiot.
Bernadette,"Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out."
Bernadette,No!
Bernadette,"Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight."
Bernadette,"Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life."
Bernadette,"We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you."
Bernadette,"Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?"
Bernadette,Looks like he’s doing pretty good.
Bernadette,"Oh, here he comes."
Bernadette,Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
Bernadette,"I’m sorry, Raj."
Bernadette,Why would you say that?
Bernadette,Think harder.
Bernadette,Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
Bernadette,Who’s involved?
Bernadette,I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
Bernadette,"Well, Alex is your employee. If she’s doing something that’s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her."
Bernadette,"Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away."
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,He’s not exhausting at all.
Bernadette,It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
Bernadette,"When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out."
Bernadette,"I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child."
Bernadette,I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?
Bernadette,"I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some."
Bernadette,The comic book store isn’t far from here.
Bernadette,Why are they staring?
Bernadette,We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
Bernadette,What kind of comics do the guys like?
Bernadette,"I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!"
Bernadette,"So, what’d you guys think?"
Bernadette,"It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist."
Bernadette,"I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it."
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,Let’s read it again.
Bernadette,You want some tea?
Bernadette,"Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?"
Bernadette,Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?
Bernadette,"Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?"
Bernadette,"Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer."
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie, I love these."
Bernadette,Were they expensive?
Bernadette,How?
Bernadette,"$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?"
Bernadette,"At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?"
Bernadette,"I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this."
Bernadette,I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
Bernadette,"No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?"
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Bernadette,Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
Bernadette,"If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.  "
Bernadette,Should we go back and rescue him?
Bernadette,"Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop."
Bernadette,"Oh, bite me."
Bernadette,"Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you."
Bernadette,"I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine."
Bernadette,"Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy."
Bernadette,And I told you to bite me.
Bernadette,Uh-oh.
Bernadette,They do look happy.
Bernadette,"You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,"Love you, too."
Bernadette,Where you’d never look.
Bernadette,"Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?"
Bernadette,Did something good happen?
Bernadette,It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
Bernadette,"Oh, you poor baby."
Bernadette,"Guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in."
Bernadette,We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We’re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
Bernadette,"Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you."
Bernadette,Weekends are too crowded.
Bernadette,Joke?
Bernadette,"So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?"
Bernadette,Let’s think.
Bernadette,What did you tell your boss?
Bernadette,"Penny, what did you say?"
Bernadette,"I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover."
Bernadette,"Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works."
Bernadette,We can’t all be Cinderella.
Bernadette,"Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now."
Bernadette,"And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist."
Bernadette,That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
Bernadette,Come at me. See what happens.
Bernadette,"Yes, and I have a surprise for you."
Bernadette,"Well, hello, Prince Charming."
Bernadette,What you doing?
Bernadette,You can’t just throw everything in the closet.
Bernadette,What if someone looks in there?
Bernadette,"Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?"
Bernadette,Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,"He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet."
Bernadette,"Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch."
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s my pleasure."
Bernadette,You stopped and got him takeout?
Bernadette,"Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day."
Bernadette,Show him the closet.
Bernadette,That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid."
Bernadette,"Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?"
Bernadette,"Howie, you okay?"
Bernadette,"Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it."
Bernadette,Did you read it?
Bernadette,You must be curious.
Bernadette,Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
Bernadette,"I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?"
Bernadette,Really? Are you sure?
Bernadette,Feel better?
Bernadette,"Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me."
Bernadette,"Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know."
Bernadette,I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
Bernadette,"Yeah, try doing it in heels."
Bernadette,Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
Bernadette,I know what was in your dad’s letter.
Bernadette,I made him tell us.
Bernadette,I’m sorry.
Bernadette,I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.
Bernadette,What are you looking at?
Bernadette,That’s nice.
Bernadette,Think you could take a break?
Bernadette,Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
Bernadette,"Sit down, honey."
Bernadette,"Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?"
Bernadette,"Sheldon, don’t you dare."
Bernadette,That’s more like it.
Bernadette,Glad you’re feeling better.
Bernadette,I think that’s enough wine for now.
Bernadette,I’m gonna make some coffee.
Bernadette,Walk.
Bernadette,"Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?"
Bernadette,Why does this bother you so much?
Bernadette,"Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god."
Bernadette,"Well, there’s no reason you can’t."
Bernadette,Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.
Bernadette,"Yeah, you two were so cute playing together."
Bernadette,And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
Bernadette,"You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family."
Bernadette,"Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it."
Bernadette,Where’d she go?
Bernadette,"Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
Bernadette,"No, I wasn’t."
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, you throw like a girl."
Bernadette,Cinnamon!
Bernadette,"You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent."
Bernadette,Thanks.
Bernadette,It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
Bernadette,Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.
Bernadette,It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?
Bernadette,"Oh, thank God she’s okay."
Bernadette,"Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?"
Bernadette,"So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?"
Bernadette,"Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Bernadette,Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
Bernadette,"Burbank Airport, please."
Bernadette,"No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules."
Bernadette,"Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules."
Bernadette,"I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack."
Bernadette,That’s an excellent question. Amy?
Bernadette,"Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone."
Bernadette,I say we attack the big one.
Bernadette,"Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
Bernadette,"This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
Bernadette,"Ooh! Come on, back me up here."
Bernadette,"Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy."
Bernadette,"You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
Bernadette,"Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
Bernadette,"So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
Bernadette,Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
Bernadette,What’s going on?
Bernadette,"The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. "
Bernadette,"Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland."
Bernadette,I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
Bernadette,To the advancement of science.
Bernadette,"This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys."
Bernadette,Be cool.
Bernadette,You’re right. Thank you.
Bernadette,It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
Bernadette,"Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
Bernadette,I don’t know what I’m saying.
Bernadette,"Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight."
Bernadette,"I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon."
Bernadette,Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
Bernadette,Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
Bernadette,Thanks.
Bernadette,Good night.
Bernadette,"Yeah, that felt nice."
Bernadette,"So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
Bernadette,"Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two."
Bernadette,Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
Bernadette,"Hi, honey."
Bernadette,I made some brownies. You want one?
Bernadette,"We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat."
Bernadette,"Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?"
Bernadette,Why can’t she do it?
Bernadette,Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
Bernadette,This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
Bernadette,"Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. "
Bernadette,That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
Bernadette,It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
Bernadette,"It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?"
Bernadette,"Oh, that happened right after you left."
Bernadette,Maybe we can do it next week.
Bernadette,Should we just do couples?
Bernadette,"Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!"
Bernadette,"Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you."
Bernadette,"Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store."
Bernadette,Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.
Bernadette,I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?"
Bernadette,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call."
Bernadette,"Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time."
Bernadette,"I knew it, we’re gonna lose."
Bernadette,"Congratulations, you got it last. "
Bernadette,"Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things."
Bernadette,Who cares? Focus on the game.
Bernadette,No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
Bernadette,Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. 
Bernadette,How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
Bernadette,If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.
Bernadette,Can you reach the clue?
Bernadette,"Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley."
Bernadette,"Great, climb back up. Come on."
Bernadette,Let’s go.
Bernadette,They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
Bernadette,"No, she doesn’t. I just made that up."
Bernadette,"Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears."
Bernadette,Wish I had a man like her on my team.
Bernadette,Maybe the spot’s the clue.
Bernadette,"Stop her, Leonard, stop her."
Bernadette,Then where’s the coin?
Bernadette,You suck so hard.
Bernadette,You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
Bernadette,"Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
Bernadette,"Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes."
Bernadette,"Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath."
Bernadette,"God, what is going on with you? "
Bernadette,And I’m not buying it. Try again.
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,"So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?"
Bernadette,"If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes."
Bernadette,"You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical."
Bernadette,"He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
Bernadette,He said what?
Bernadette,"Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband."
Bernadette,Well?
Bernadette,What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
Bernadette,Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
Bernadette,"That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. "
Bernadette,Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
Bernadette,Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,I may have overreacted.
Bernadette,It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
Bernadette,"It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
Bernadette,Why tomorrow?
Bernadette,I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
Bernadette,Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
Bernadette,"In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
Bernadette,"Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already."
Bernadette,"Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. "
Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date."
Bernadette,What’s all this?
Bernadette,Howie.
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Bernadette,"Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking."
Bernadette,"Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making."
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,"Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it."
Bernadette,Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
Bernadette,"He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger."
Bernadette,"Penny, can we please get our drinks?"
Bernadette,"Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
Bernadette,That’s Lucy?
Bernadette,I think that reason’s called racism.
Bernadette,Why? What are you gonna say?
Bernadette,You because you just called him your Indian friend.
Bernadette,"No, but we knew that."
Bernadette,"We did, you never brought it."
Bernadette,"So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?"
Bernadette,Then you made her cry and leave.
Bernadette,"If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
Bernadette,"Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,"Maybe, if she asks."
Bernadette,I’d save that for the second date.
Bernadette,"Hi, Dad."
Bernadette,"Oh, you brought beer for everybody."
Bernadette,You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
Bernadette,I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
Bernadette,"If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy."
Bernadette,"Oh, well, that’s a great idea."
Bernadette,Thanks for saving the day.
Bernadette,I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
Bernadette,"Don’t be silly, he loves you."
Bernadette,"Okay, he cares about you a lot."
Bernadette,I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome. "
Bernadette,How’s it going out there?
Bernadette,What are they doing?
Bernadette,So why don’t you do that with them?
Bernadette,What do you mean?
Bernadette,"Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes."
Bernadette,"Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now."
Bernadette,It’s okay.
Bernadette,Thanks again for cooking.
Bernadette,Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
Bernadette,"Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here."
Bernadette,Howie. 
Bernadette,The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,"I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest."
Bernadette,He’s bringing Cinnamon?
Bernadette,"Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?"
Bernadette,"Aw, that’s so sweet."
Bernadette,"Thank you, Raj."
Bernadette,"Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,Aw! Raj did the dishes.
Bernadette,"Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
Bernadette,"Aw, you didn’t have to do that."
Bernadette,What presentation do I have today?
Bernadette,"Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
Bernadette,"Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
Bernadette,"Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj."
Bernadette,"Oh, really?"
Bernadette,"Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em."
Bernadette,This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
Bernadette,You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
Bernadette,I back you up all the time.
Bernadette,What is wrong with you?
Bernadette,"Good idea, I’ll take a picture."
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,"Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later."
Bernadette,But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.
Bernadette,Well…
Bernadette,"Hey, Penny, can I take that table?"
Bernadette,The one in the turtleneck is cute.
Bernadette,Never mind.
Bernadette,"You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him. "
Bernadette,"Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
Bernadette,"Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?"
Bernadette,How is this any different?
Bernadette,"Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?"
Bernadette,You actually got him to do it.
Bernadette,"Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart."
Bernadette,"Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way."
Bernadette,Or maybe just stop talking.
Bernadette,Or just keep dating the possum.
Bernadette,What happened?
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,That’s interesting.
Bernadette,"If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
Bernadette,"No, of course not."
Bernadette,I don’t think you would.
Bernadette,How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
Bernadette,So am I.
Bernadette,Hey Stuart.
Bernadette,Sorry. Did I startle you?
Bernadette,"Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it."
Bernadette,Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
Bernadette,Do you have this one?
Bernadette,"Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work."
Bernadette,"Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
Bernadette,"You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. "
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s great."
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?"
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean."
Bernadette,Wow.
Bernadette,"No, thanks."
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.
Bernadette,"Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart."
Bernadette,"Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now."
Bernadette,"No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. "
Bernadette,"Well, that sounds even better."
Bernadette,Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
Bernadette,"Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
Bernadette,"Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
Bernadette,"La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
Bernadette,I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
Bernadette,That’s cute.
Bernadette,Should we leave?
Bernadette,I could go for a drink.
Bernadette,"Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids."
Bernadette,Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.
Bernadette,"Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
Bernadette,Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
Bernadette,I’m gonna fix this right now.
Bernadette,Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
Bernadette,Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
Bernadette,"Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200"
Bernadette,See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.
Bernadette,"So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me."
Bernadette,"Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?"
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Bernadette,Sorry.
Bernadette,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Bernadette,Let’s go.
Bernadette,"Guys, you’re being childish."
Bernadette,Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,Fine. Can I at least shower first?
Bernadette,What are you talking about?
Bernadette,"Wow. Well, what did you say?"
Bernadette,"Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back."
Bernadette,Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
Bernadette,He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?
Bernadette,So you’ll talk to him?
Bernadette,"Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him."
Bernadette,Since when am I the buzzkill?
Bernadette,"No, I think it’s stupid."
Bernadette,"You’re right, it’s great."
Bernadette,"Hi, honey."
Bernadette,Maybe you should have a seat.
Bernadette,Daddy.
Bernadette,"I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you."
Bernadette,Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s fun up here."
Bernadette,Now I feel bad.
Bernadette,"No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups."
Bernadette,Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
Bernadette,"Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you."
Bernadette,"Raj, your tag’s sticking out."
Bernadette,Now I feel a little gross.
Bernadette,Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
Bernadette,Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Bernadette,That was ten years ago.
Bernadette,What are you doing?
Bernadette,This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
Bernadette,I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,You excited for Texas?
Bernadette,I did. His talk at NASA went great.
Bernadette,"No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream."
Bernadette,"Hi, Stuart."
Bernadette,"Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something."
Bernadette,I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
Bernadette,"All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?"
Bernadette,"What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?"
Bernadette,What do you care? You’re dead.
Bernadette,"So, what happens next?"
Bernadette,I didn’t know you were fat.
Bernadette,"Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt."
Bernadette,For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.
Bernadette,So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
Bernadette,So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
Bernadette,"Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps."
Bernadette,What the hell?
Bernadette,"Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses."
Bernadette,I liked the time travel element.
Bernadette,"Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends."
Bernadette,Aw.
Bernadette,Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
Bernadette,"Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
Bernadette,"Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign."
Bernadette,But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
Bernadette,"So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”"
Bernadette,“LOL.” Smiley face.
Bernadette,“P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”
Bernadette,Am I a terrible person?
Bernadette,Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
Bernadette,I’m so sorry.
Bernadette,Are you gonna take it?
Bernadette,I like the Wii.
Bernadette,"What do you mean, yes?"
Bernadette,Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,"Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition."
Bernadette,"The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings."
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,I’m excited to meet Emily.
Bernadette,Why would you say that?
Bernadette,How?
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,"Emily, what do you do?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, what happened?"
Bernadette,Please don’t say it.
Bernadette,Howie.
Bernadette,"So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?"
Bernadette,"You’re kidding, right?"
Bernadette,"Howie, we moved on a long time ago."
Bernadette,We moved on.
Bernadette,How’s your soup?
Bernadette,Where are you going?
Bernadette,We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
Bernadette,"I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon."
Bernadette,Of course.
Bernadette,"Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice."
Bernadette,"Oh, we know you don’t lie to her."
Bernadette,"I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet."
Bernadette,"Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake."
Bernadette,"Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while."
Bernadette,This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.
Bernadette,"No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it."
Bernadette,"Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?"
Bernadette,Girl Sprouts?
Bernadette,How did that get you into science?
Bernadette,Happy Star Wars Day.
Bernadette,"And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun."
Bernadette,Son of a bitch.
Bernadette,Almost there. You’re doing great.
Bernadette,We set it up in Howie’s old room.
Bernadette,Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
Bernadette,Howie.
Bernadette,Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
Bernadette,I would do it for my mother.
Bernadette,"Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
Bernadette,You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.
Bernadette,You are a putz.
Bernadette,"You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like."
Bernadette,"Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own."
Bernadette,"I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work."
Bernadette,"Howie, I’m back!"
Bernadette,Sorry.
Bernadette,They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
Bernadette,"So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
Bernadette,Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.
Bernadette,I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
Bernadette,"Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this."
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,You were right.
Bernadette,"She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting."
Bernadette,You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
Bernadette,"I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people."
Bernadette,That’s not helpful.
Bernadette,But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
Bernadette,"I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell."
Bernadette,"Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce."
Bernadette,"Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law."
Bernadette,"Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family."
Bernadette,"It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again."
Bernadette,You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
Bernadette,Please. I’m desperate.
Bernadette,I’ll pay you anything you want.
Bernadette,I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
Bernadette,"So, she’s not too much for you?"
Bernadette,"Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
Bernadette,Yep.
Bernadette,"Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
Bernadette,"This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
Bernadette,"Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you."
Bernadette,You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.
Bernadette,"Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it."
Bernadette,It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.
Bernadette,"Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?"
Bernadette,"I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today."
Bernadette,"Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me."
Bernadette,Howie?
Bernadette,"Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father."
Bernadette,"Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him."
Bernadette,Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
Bernadette,Great. When?
Bernadette,"I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start."
Bernadette,But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
Bernadette,Couldn’t hurt.
Bernadette,Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?
Bernadette,Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.
Bernadette,"So it’s not just me. You see it, too."
Bernadette,"It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
Bernadette,I know.
Bernadette,Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
Bernadette,"Hey, Amy."
Bernadette,"That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study."
Bernadette,"I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good."
Bernadette,"Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal."
Bernadette,"Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,Want to stop here?
Bernadette,"Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy."
Bernadette,I can’t believe you’re sore.
Bernadette,But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
Bernadette,I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
Bernadette,"Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up."
Bernadette,"Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
Bernadette,"All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate."
Bernadette,Keep going.
Bernadette,I’ll let you know.
Bernadette,"Okay, stop."
Bernadette,That’s sixty feet.
Bernadette,I’m looking at it.
Bernadette,"Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it."
Bernadette,Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.
Bernadette,Throw the damn ball!
Bernadette,Think he’s getting any better?
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,I think so.
Bernadette,He’s so nice.
Bernadette,"Howie, I am so proud of you."
Bernadette,Go get ’em.
Bernadette,Why is it going so slow?
Bernadette,But he’s going to.
Bernadette,"Long story short, they have seven HBOs."
Bernadette,"You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time."
Bernadette,Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?
Bernadette,Did she say she didn’t like you?
Bernadette,You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?
Bernadette,I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
Bernadette,Really?
Bernadette,"When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine."
Bernadette,"Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you."
Bernadette,And I’m sure you can turn it around.
Bernadette,"Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?"
Bernadette,"Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute."
Bernadette,"Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas."
Bernadette,Nope.
Bernadette,I know.
Bernadette,Fine. What is it?
Bernadette,Nope.
Bernadette,"Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house."
Bernadette,It just seems like a risky investment.
Bernadette,"Oh. Howie, I had no idea."
Bernadette,"Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?"
Bernadette,"Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions."
Bernadette,"Hell, yeah."
Bernadette,I’ll check hotels.
Bernadette,"Well, what do you want to do?"
Bernadette,That sucks.
Bernadette,You sure?
Bernadette,We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Bernadette,"I think after this, I’ll be dead."
Bernadette,I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.
Bernadette,We are.
Bernadette,Amy.
Bernadette,You’re embarrassing me.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,Housekeeping.
Bernadette,It was us the whole time.
Bernadette,Was it working?
Bernadette,"Oh, I’m so sorry."
Bernadette,Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
Bernadette,Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
Bernadette,We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
Bernadette,"Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string like a baby kangaroo?"
Bernadette,Aren’t you gonna chase her?
Bernadette,See? Isn’t this better than a hotel room?
Bernadette,Have you ever seen a body so fine?
Bernadette,Would you please close the drapes?
Bernadette,I like your suit.
Bernadette,"Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?"
Bernadette,Oh. What’s going on?
Bernadette,Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
Bernadette,I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
Bernadette,"Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie."
Bernadette,"Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should."
Bernadette,Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
Bernadette,Without asking me?
Bernadette,"How much, Howie?"
Bernadette,How much?
Bernadette,Was it more or less than falconry school?
Bernadette,"Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here."
Bernadette,That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
Bernadette,"Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance."
Bernadette,Sorry you guys had to see that.
Bernadette,Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
Bernadette,"Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him."
Bernadette,I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him.
Bernadette,I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.
Bernadette,"No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship."
Bernadette,"Now, let’s talk about your birthday party."
Bernadette,Oh.
Bernadette,"So, what are you working on these days?"
Bernadette,What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
Bernadette,"He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?"
Bernadette,Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
Bernadette,"I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad."
Bernadette,"It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
Bernadette,I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
Bernadette,"I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here."
Bernadette,What? How?
Bernadette,"Amy, what did you say?"
Bernadette,"Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche."
Bernadette,"No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity."
Bernadette,"That’s for me to decide, not you."
Bernadette,"And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line."
Bernadette,"Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong."
Bernadette,"Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry."
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,We brought snacks for movie night.
Bernadette,Right here.
Bernadette,"Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
Bernadette,Slutty.
Bernadette,How was your prom? Did you go?
Bernadette,"My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her."
Bernadette,Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
Bernadette,"Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over."
Bernadette,"Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
Bernadette,"Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?"
Bernadette,"Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is."
Bernadette,"Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom."
Bernadette,I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
Bernadette,That’s a neat tattoo.
Bernadette,"Aw, that movie’s so cute."
Bernadette,I like Cinderella.
Bernadette,I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,That’s Jeanie?
Bernadette,"So, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf."
Bernadette,"Howie, get off of him."
Bernadette,Not anymore.
Bernadette,"Well, what are some of the things they like?"
Bernadette,He said that to her?
Bernadette,They’re yours in the divorce.
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,"Oh, muffin much."
Bernadette,He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.
Bernadette,"Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up."
Bernadette,"Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off."
Bernadette,"Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?"
Bernadette,"It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?"
Bernadette,Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us."
Bernadette,"Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?"
Bernadette,So there are things you don’t like.
Bernadette,"Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad."
Bernadette,"Oh. Howie, be serious."
Bernadette,"Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea."
Bernadette,Who were you in couples therapy with?
Bernadette,Was it your mom?
Bernadette,It was your mom.
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that."
Bernadette,"Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh."
Bernadette,"And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me."
Bernadette,"Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that."
Bernadette,"I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair."
Bernadette,"I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought."
Bernadette,"Oh, how is she?"
Bernadette,"Hey, what are you talking about?"
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
Bernadette,"Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”"
Bernadette,What’s his problem?
Bernadette,"Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore."
Bernadette,"What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies."
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah? You one of those people?"
Bernadette,"I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody."
Bernadette,"I did say that, didn’t I?"
Bernadette,Where? To Babies R Us?
Bernadette,"Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me."
Bernadette,I think I’d rather go.
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,"Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Bernadette,Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
Bernadette,"No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me."
Bernadette,"No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me."
Bernadette,No problem. When does that start?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,Who’s been paying for my coffee?
Bernadette,What else don’t I know about?
Bernadette,Yeah?
Bernadette,You’re kidding.
Bernadette,I feel so bad.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster."
Bernadette,"No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person."
Bernadette,It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
Bernadette,I can’t let you do that.
Bernadette,I guess that would be all right.
Bernadette,You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
Bernadette,I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
Bernadette,Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
Bernadette,"Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?"
Bernadette,"Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something."
Bernadette,She’s just excited about the holidays.
Bernadette,How?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that."
Bernadette,Then you’re both sad?
Bernadette,So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
Bernadette,What about that sweater?
Bernadette,I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
Bernadette,"Wow, you really do love her."
Bernadette,You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
Bernadette,You okay?
Bernadette,I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.
Bernadette,What’s he talking about?
Bernadette,"All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack."
Bernadette,"You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens."
Bernadette,We were talking about Penny’s job.
Bernadette,"Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to oranges."
Bernadette,Emily’s feelings?
Bernadette,What happened?
Bernadette,Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?
Bernadette,"Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?"
Bernadette,Search for it.
Bernadette,‘Cause it would be fun to watch.
Bernadette,"Well, now we have two reasons."
Bernadette,"Please, can we watch it?"
Bernadette,"Well, maybe it turned out better than you think."
Bernadette,"Ho-ho, it really didn’t."
Bernadette,"No, give me the remote."
Bernadette,"Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong."
Bernadette,‘Cause it’s embarrassing.
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet."
Bernadette,"Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
Bernadette,We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
Bernadette,Please?
Bernadette,Why? Why did it feel different?
Bernadette,"Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting."
Bernadette,Here we go.
Bernadette,"Oh, Amelia."
Bernadette,Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
Bernadette,I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.
Bernadette,Please?
Bernadette,But they didn’t even kiss.
Bernadette,Not now!
Bernadette,Your mom having fun in Florida?
Bernadette,She’s just being nice.
Bernadette,Because you have a wife.
Bernadette,"I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet."
Bernadette,"Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure."
Bernadette,"Stuart, this place looks amazing."
Bernadette,Howie.
Bernadette,Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?
Bernadette,"I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture."
Bernadette,"Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
Bernadette,This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
Bernadette,Can you please just let it go?
Bernadette,You helped him?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Howie."
Bernadette,Eight sixteen.
Bernadette,Just drop it.
Bernadette,"Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle."
Bernadette,"So, where is it?"
Bernadette,"Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us."
Bernadette,"All right, we’ll wait."
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?
Bernadette,"You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman."
Bernadette,"Okay, thank you so much."
Bernadette,"Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom."
Bernadette,Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
Bernadette,A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
Bernadette,What’s happening?
Bernadette,Aw. I’m gonna miss her.
Bernadette,"Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping."
Bernadette,She sounds really mad.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we should."
Bernadette,Not a chance.
Bernadette,"Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?"
Bernadette,"Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go."
Bernadette,Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
Bernadette,What happened?
Bernadette,"Howie, what’s wrong?"
Bernadette,It’s okay. It’s just food.
Bernadette,"Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?"
Bernadette,What should we do?
Bernadette,"There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
Bernadette,Howie.
Bernadette,I love that.
Bernadette,Thanks.
Bernadette,Did she throw anything away?
Bernadette,You okay?
Bernadette,Should we tell everyone not to come?
Bernadette,"Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can."
Bernadette,"Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before."
Bernadette,"No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable."
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s fine."
Bernadette,"Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!"
Bernadette,"Good news, I found more Tums."
Bernadette,"So, I put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway."
Bernadette,"You know, you can leave one side up and play against it."
Bernadette,I think you just answered your own question.
Bernadette,"Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don’t need to decide this right now."
Bernadette,Of course.
Bernadette,It’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
Bernadette,You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?
Bernadette,How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
Bernadette,"Yes, Penny plays for me."
Bernadette,"Leonard makes you watch that, too?"
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj. if Howard can’t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?"
Bernadette,"I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who."
Bernadette,"Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj."
Bernadette,"Oh, come on, like you even care."
Bernadette,"Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?"
Bernadette,"Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating."
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,"Don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
Bernadette,One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.
Bernadette,Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.
Bernadette,"You know, Amy, I, uh, can’t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place."
Bernadette,"If this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will."
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj."
Bernadette,"Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies."
Bernadette,"You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures."
Bernadette,"Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball."
Bernadette,"Oh, let me do it, Howard."
Bernadette,"So, Josh, what do you do?"
Bernadette,"Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo."
Bernadette,Why don’t you help with the coffee?
Bernadette,"Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
Bernadette,Keep dreaming.
Bernadette,He did it with a robot.
Bernadette,What’s going on in here?
Bernadette,Oh. How do you drink it?
Bernadette,I think I’ll have a beer.
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
Bernadette,"Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together."
Bernadette,Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.
Bernadette,You’re being childish.
Bernadette,I’m sorry. What do we know?
Bernadette,"Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
Bernadette,I was kidding. Of course you are.
Bernadette,"You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?"
Bernadette,There’s my big boss man.
Bernadette,"Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
Bernadette,"Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard."
Bernadette,"You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner."
Bernadette,How about now?
Bernadette,Don’t forget your wallet.
Bernadette,"Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
Bernadette,I have the tool you wanted.
Bernadette,Why don’t you just call tech support?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,I call tech support all the time.
Bernadette,Four hours of our lives gone? Check.
Bernadette,Ready to call tech support?
Bernadette,Maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.
Bernadette,Stuart.
Bernadette,"We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants."
Bernadette,"Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
Bernadette,"Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom."
Bernadette,"Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
Bernadette,Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
Bernadette,You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
Bernadette,"The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it."
Bernadette,"Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night."
Bernadette,"I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it."
Bernadette,I don’t know.
Bernadette,That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
Bernadette,Did you eat all my yoghurt?
Bernadette,You know which yoghurt I mean.
Bernadette,Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
Bernadette,"I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick."
Bernadette,All right. Tonight’s the night.
Bernadette,"Ooh, I like when you take charge."
Bernadette,Right.
Bernadette,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here."
Bernadette,Don’t let that sway you.
Bernadette,"So, we need to talk."
Bernadette,"Well, you’ve been living here a while now."
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is… "
Bernadette,Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,"For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?"
Bernadette,"Howard, do something."
Bernadette,"Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting."
Bernadette,"Aw, that was beautiful."
Bernadette,"No, we totally won."
Bernadette,Amy.
Bernadette,"I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better."
Bernadette,That’s true.
Bernadette,What happened? They just got married.
Bernadette,Think they’ll break up?
Bernadette,Hands off. I’m mad at you.
Bernadette,What will pay for itself?
Bernadette,"I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years."
Bernadette,"I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me."
Bernadette,I guess that’s true.
Bernadette,"I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it."
Bernadette,"Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing."
Bernadette,"You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice."
Bernadette,"Oh, me neither, not until just now."
Bernadette,"Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?"
Bernadette,"Oh, look, Jewish and gentile."
Bernadette,I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.
Bernadette,You guys still aren’t living together?
Bernadette,"Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?"
Bernadette,Good for you.
Bernadette,Good for you.
Bernadette,Your sweater?
Bernadette,Your hair?
Bernadette,You really never had that done?
Bernadette,We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
Bernadette,This party’s weird.
Bernadette,"Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook."
Bernadette,Did you change yours to married yet?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,What about your sister’s wedding?
Bernadette,"Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?"
Bernadette,"That’s a joke, right?"
Bernadette,Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
Bernadette,It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
Bernadette,"Okay, Amy, your turn."
Bernadette,What did we do?
Bernadette,Really? They didn’t eat him?
Bernadette,The breakfast meat family?
Bernadette,Of course.
Bernadette,Aw. I’m honoured.
Bernadette,"So, I’m your seventh choice."
Bernadette,How can I help you?
Bernadette,"Well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new."
Bernadette,Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?
Bernadette,Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now. I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.
Bernadette,"Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate."
Bernadette,He’ll think about it.
Bernadette,I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
Bernadette,"Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart."
Bernadette,"I’m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
Bernadette,Sure. So how can we help?
Bernadette,You are.
Bernadette,Was it?
Bernadette,That really happened?
Bernadette,Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
Bernadette,"Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over."
Bernadette,"Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day."
Bernadette,What did he say?
Bernadette,What can it hurt?
Bernadette,"You mean, not a scientist?"
Bernadette,Are you attracted to him?
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Walk.
Bernadette,Howie?
Bernadette,Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
Bernadette,"Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart."
Bernadette,"I thought so, too."
Bernadette,He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
Bernadette,"I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game."
Bernadette,Can you show us that dating app?
Bernadette,"Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it."
Bernadette,Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
Bernadette,"Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?"
Bernadette,"We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there."
Bernadette,"Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin."
Bernadette,And I’d love to take you out again”?
Bernadette,"Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?"
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,"I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people."
Bernadette,And how many guys have you gone out with?
Bernadette,Hey. You got a minute?
Bernadette,"Pause the game, Howard."
Bernadette,We need to talk about redecorating this place.
Bernadette,"Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too."
Bernadette,"All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things."
Bernadette,Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
Bernadette,Whatcha doing?
Bernadette,"Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
Bernadette,Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
Bernadette,How ’bout this one?
Bernadette,Then how ’bout the bathroom?
Bernadette,Fine. Then the dining room.
Bernadette,Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall."
Bernadette,Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
Bernadette,He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.
Bernadette,Aftershock.
Bernadette,So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
Bernadette,I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.
Bernadette,"Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it."
Bernadette,"Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?"
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,"Okay, I’ll think about it."
Bernadette,It’s an actual I’ll think about it.
Bernadette,I know you would.
Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy."
Bernadette,"Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man."
Bernadette,Did you kiss him yet?
Bernadette,Tea and basketball?
Bernadette,"Oh, nice."
Bernadette,"Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?"
Bernadette,"I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation."
Bernadette,"Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable."
Bernadette,"Across the street, in the left window."
Bernadette,Right here.
Bernadette,"Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends."
Bernadette,No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
Bernadette,"He’s cute, right?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone."
Bernadette,Nothing. Not important.
Bernadette,I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
Bernadette,Why’d you bring him?
Bernadette,"Ugh, I hear that."
Bernadette,Right here.
Bernadette,"Hey, hey, they’re leaving."
Bernadette,We got to get out of here.
Bernadette,He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. 
Bernadette,"Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?"
Bernadette,"And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
Bernadette,You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
Bernadette,"The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours."
Bernadette,"We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh."
Bernadette,Hi. We’d like to volunteer.
Bernadette,Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
Bernadette,That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.
Bernadette,"Oh, great. We’d love to help."
Bernadette,I can’t.
Bernadette,What difference does it make?
Bernadette,I’ll do it.
Bernadette,Happy Thanks… Yikes.
Bernadette,"So, you’re really going out with Dave again?"
Bernadette,But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
Bernadette,Okay. So where’s he taking you?
Bernadette,Oh. That’s a big step.
Bernadette,Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.
Bernadette,You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
Bernadette,‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
Bernadette,Who’s Trent?
Bernadette,Fan of what?
Bernadette,You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
Bernadette,Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.
Bernadette,Maybe I should marry Trent.
Bernadette,"What happens if I say, come in?"
Bernadette,Come in.
Bernadette,Just come in.
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,How about something a little more realistic?
Bernadette,"Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin."
Bernadette,Wild thang.
Bernadette,"Yeah, are you ready for this?"
Bernadette,So where do you want to go?
Bernadette,"Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
Bernadette,"We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical."
Bernadette,"Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…"
Bernadette,"No, they’re not."
Bernadette,Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
Bernadette,"Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin."
Bernadette,It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
Bernadette,"No, it’s okay."
Bernadette,"So, when are you thinking of moving?"
Bernadette,Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
Bernadette,You’re very welcome.
Bernadette,Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
Bernadette,Nobody thought that.
Bernadette,I guess so.
Bernadette,Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
Bernadette,"Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in."
Bernadette,Our pleasure.
Bernadette,Goodbye.
Bernadette,"Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?"
Bernadette,"Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?"
Bernadette,Why can’t it be a woman cave?
Bernadette,I’m being serious.
Bernadette,"I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair."
Bernadette,"Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
Bernadette,Have you heard from him since he left?
Bernadette,Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.
Bernadette,"No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?"
Bernadette,"And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple."
Bernadette,"Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!"
Bernadette,Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
Bernadette,We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
Bernadette,I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
Bernadette,You’re gonna want to take these with food.
Bernadette,"Forgiven, forgiven."
Bernadette,And he made it all better.
Bernadette,You know what that means.
Bernadette,This is so cool.
Bernadette,"Ooh, work that thing."
Bernadette,"Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her."
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad."
Bernadette,I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
Bernadette,"Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?"
Bernadette,Absolutely.
Bernadette,"Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this."
Bernadette,"No, you didn’t."
Bernadette,"Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out."
Bernadette,Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
Bernadette,You’re right. It could totally happen.
Bernadette,You still have a girlfriend.
Bernadette,Are you gonna tell Emily?
Bernadette,Don’t make it too hot.
Bernadette,"Look at that, you shaved it all."
Bernadette,"Ew, really? Get it out."
Bernadette,"Uh, wish we had a skimmer."
Bernadette,I don’t know how to turn off the jets.
Bernadette,"I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive."
Bernadette,"No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it."
Bernadette,"Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel."
Bernadette,Anything else?
Bernadette,He’s eating. That’s a good sign.
Bernadette,He’s pretty cute.
Bernadette,It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?
Bernadette,Are you okay?
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
Bernadette,He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.
Bernadette,"Oh, terrific."
Bernadette,"If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested."
Bernadette,"Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is."
Bernadette,"Howie, this is just your hypochondria."
Bernadette,We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.
Bernadette,Morning.
Bernadette,I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.
Bernadette,What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…"
Bernadette,"I know, it’s crazy."
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out."
Bernadette,"I don’t know, Howie."
Bernadette,"Calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
Bernadette,"So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…"
Bernadette,I’m pregnant.
Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s all real exciting."
Bernadette,"I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat."
Bernadette,"Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones."
Bernadette,"You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down."
Bernadette,Where?
Bernadette,Can’t drink.
Bernadette,Doctor said I can’t have sushi.
Bernadette,Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.
Bernadette,I kind of already do that for Howie.
Bernadette,"Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless."
Bernadette,"No, I’m embarrassed."
Bernadette,"Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
Bernadette,"Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…"
Bernadette,Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.
Bernadette,"I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here."
Bernadette,"I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another."
Bernadette,You guys can go in if you want.
Bernadette,That sounds fun.
Bernadette,How is that a drunk text?
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,"It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too."
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,"I appreciate this, but you really…"
Bernadette,What kind of cake do you like?
Bernadette,"No, no, no. Come on in."
Bernadette,Doing great.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon."
Bernadette,A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.
Bernadette,"Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass."
Bernadette,That’s nice.
Bernadette,"You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?"
Bernadette,Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.
Bernadette,What is that?
Bernadette,I wonder how much she spent on this.
Bernadette,Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
Bernadette,Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.
Bernadette,"Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here."
Bernadette,"I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?"
Bernadette,What is it?
Bernadette,"So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
Bernadette,"I know, but…"
Bernadette,"Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea."
Bernadette,"If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead."
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.
Bernadette,"Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper."
Bernadette,I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
Bernadette,You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
Bernadette,Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?
Bernadette,How would you enforce it?
Bernadette,"25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that’s so nice."
Bernadette,We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
Bernadette,Can we really help?
Bernadette,Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.
Bernadette,I’m kind of getting into the groove here.
Bernadette,It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
Bernadette,Since when do you work on weekends?
Bernadette,Not with Lightning McQueen here.
Bernadette,I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
Bernadette,What’s going on?
Bernadette,Son of a bitch.
Bernadette,"Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves."
Bernadette,"Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out."
Bernadette,Go hide.
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, thank you for being honest."
Bernadette,It’s okay. They apologized.
Bernadette,Should we invite Raj?
Bernadette,"Come on, Raj, give me a bag."
Bernadette,"Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store."
Bernadette,Yes and yes.
Bernadette,"I didn’t, but Raj volunteered."
Bernadette,"Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me."
Bernadette,Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
Bernadette,I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat."
Bernadette,"Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here."
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up."
Bernadette,Leave it alone. He means well.
Bernadette,"No, not really."
Bernadette,He’s just trying to be supportive.
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,You saw him carrying that.
Bernadette,"And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this."
Bernadette,"Raj, Raj, wait."
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,I can’t tell anymore.
Bernadette,And bring back the bear.
Bernadette,I hear that.
Bernadette,Of course.
Bernadette,I’m not hearing anything.
Bernadette,"Wait, that’s it."
Bernadette,Isn’t that the best?
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj."
Bernadette,Good. A little tired.
Bernadette,You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
Bernadette,He’s gonna be okay.
Bernadette,Why are you dressed like that?
Bernadette,That wasn’t nice.
Bernadette,You all right?
Bernadette,"It’s okay, you should go."
Bernadette,Of course.
Bernadette,Me? How? Why?
Bernadette,"Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know."
Bernadette,I guess we could give it a try.
Bernadette,I brought sparkling cider.
Bernadette,So what do you want to do tonight?
Bernadette,There’s more than one?
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,Yeah.
Bernadette,"I’m sorry, I have to ask."
Bernadette,What is it about trains that you like so much?
Bernadette,"That’s lovely, Sheldon."
Bernadette,Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
Bernadette,"Okay, but just for a little bit."
Bernadette,All right.
Bernadette,You bet.
Bernadette,Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
Bernadette,This is getting fun. What’s next?
Bernadette,"Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months."
Bernadette,"I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
Bernadette,Does it have eyes?
Bernadette,I stab it in the middle eye.
Bernadette,"Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn."
Bernadette,"Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought."
Bernadette,"Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight."
Bernadette,"Well, thanks again."
Bernadette,I might just take you up on that.
Bernadette,"Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t."
Bernadette,"So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?"
Bernadette,"Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team."
Bernadette,Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
Bernadette,"Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?"
Bernadette,Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
Bernadette,"Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too."
Bernadette,But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
Bernadette,Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.
Bernadette,Who’s going to officiate?
Bernadette,Who’s Erno Rubik?
Bernadette,"Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother."
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting."
Bernadette,"You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?"
Bernadette,"Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner."
Bernadette,Are you done with this nonsense?
Bernadette,"Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you."
Bernadette,You’re being ridiculous.
Bernadette,"It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
Bernadette,Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.
Bernadette,Because you were driving like a lunatic.
Bernadette,It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
Bernadette,"Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house."
Bernadette,"Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants."
Bernadette,"Okay, I think we’re ready."
Bernadette,We’re here today to celebrate love.
Bernadette,"Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
Bernadette,"Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off."
Bernadette,Howard.
Bernadette,Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
Bernadette,"Thank you. All right, let’s continue."
Bernadette,Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
Bernadette,"I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck."
Bernadette,He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
Bernadette,I don’t believe this.
Bernadette,This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
Bernadette,No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
Bernadette,"I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
Bernadette,"‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else."
Bernadette,"I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant."
Bernadette,I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
Bernadette,"From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows."
Bernadette,Thanks. You guys are the best.
Bernadette,I forgot my coat.
Bernadette,Hey. What brings you by?
Bernadette,Oh. How was it?
Bernadette,Fell asleep?
Bernadette,I’m furious.
Bernadette,"No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about."
Bernadette,It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
Bernadette,What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.
Bernadette,Why did you do that?
Bernadette,Get out.
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
Bernadette,Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
Bernadette,"I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing."
Bernadette,"Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy"
Bernadette,"I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,"Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start."
Bernadette,Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?
Bernadette,And a chocolate shake.
Bernadette,Got a minute?
Bernadette,I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
Bernadette,"For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar."
Bernadette,"Well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and I’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury."
Bernadette,"Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch."
Bernadette,Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning.
Bernadette,"You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I’ll have the jury eating out of my hand."
Bernadette,It’s okay.
Bernadette,You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
Bernadette,"Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me."
Bernadette,Not really.
Bernadette,I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.
Bernadette,Isn’t it a little early for that?
Bernadette,"Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing."
Bernadette,I don’t think you are.
Bernadette,I don’t even know where to begin.
Bernadette,"Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here."
Bernadette,Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
Bernadette,My dad built it for me.
Bernadette,"This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
Bernadette,"They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox."
Bernadette,Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
Bernadette,Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.
Bernadette,Does it really need one?
Bernadette,"Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos."
Bernadette,Are you just gonna name all the colours?
Bernadette,I don’t care what colour the room is.
Bernadette,"Well, you’re not, so just drop it.  I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?"
Bernadette,I don’t know.
Bernadette,"Raj, why don’t I care about anything?"
Bernadette,"It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?"
Bernadette,"I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?"
Bernadette,"Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
Bernadette,"What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you."
Bernadette,"Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies."
Bernadette,But I thought I’d be more excited.
Bernadette,Thank you. I feel better now.
Bernadette,It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
Bernadette,"Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
Bernadette,What if it’s a girl?
Bernadette,Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
Bernadette,"Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter."
Bernadette,You looked in our folder?!
Bernadette,"God, Raj."
Bernadette,We don’t want you to know.
Bernadette,"This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?"
Bernadette,I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
Bernadette,Everyone said I could do better.
Bernadette,"Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know."
Bernadette,"Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!"
Bernadette,Yes.
Bernadette,Wait.
Bernadette,Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
Bernadette,But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
Bernadette,"Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
Bernadette,You just heard me throwing up.
Bernadette,You’re so weird.
Bernadette,That feels great.
Bernadette,Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
Bernadette,"Lock the door, lock the door."
Bernadette,"Uh, I left my phone downstairs."
Bernadette,"Wait, I have my iPad."
Bernadette,That’s not helpful.
Bernadette,"Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny."
Bernadette,Who would use our hot tub?
Bernadette,Who is it?
Bernadette,Should we say something to him?
Bernadette,"I meant like, what are you doing here?"
Bernadette,"Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
Bernadette,Is someone else here?
Bernadette,What?
Bernadette,I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.
Bernadette,You said you got it back.
Bernadette,Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?
Bernadette,"Yeah, he deserves to be alone."
Bernadette,What do you do in there?
Bernadette,What are you doing?
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it."
Bernadette,Which MIT did you go to?
Bernadette,"Howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
Bernadette,The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
Bernadette,"I warned you, and I did it."
Bernadette,"Hey, where you been?"
Bernadette,You bought a crib without me?
Bernadette,Sounds expensive.
Bernadette,Fine.
Bernadette,You bought a minivan?
Bernadette,I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.
Bernadette,"They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
Bernadette,"I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?"
Bernadette,It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
Bernadette,"Oh, is it your back?"
Bernadette,Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
Bernadette,"Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van."
Bernadette,I was hoping it’d be quieter.
Bernadette,Soon.
Bernadette,Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.
Bernadette,"Actually, it’s been ready for weeks."
Bernadette,"Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule."
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
Bernadette,"Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything."
Bernadette,"Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
Bernadette,"Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you."
Bernadette,I’m running out of ways to act excited.
Bernadette,"Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
Bernadette,Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
Bernadette,You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
Bernadette,Mine has a fully developed immune system.
Bernadette,Who is it?
Bernadette,Where did you get that?
Bernadette,Why would you buy it?
Bernadette,Last question. What is wrong with you?
Bernadette,"Howie, it’s in poor taste."
Bernadette,"Okay, call him and show him. I dare you."
Bernadette,"Fine, then do it."
Bernadette,"While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
Bernadette,I can’t imagine you being violent.
Bernadette,I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
Bernadette,I think he looks cute.
Bernadette,"Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift."
Bernadette,A foot massage?
Bernadette,How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
Bernadette,"Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby."
Bernadette,"Thank you, but I’m not really sure."
Bernadette,I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
Bernadette,Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
Bernadette,"I did that, too."
Bernadette,Howard just did that.
Bernadette,"Stuart, you cooked?"
Bernadette,"There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess."
Bernadette,You have a Batsuit.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that."
Bernadette,Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
Bernadette,"Do something, Batman."
Bernadette,"Great, go with the giraffes."
Bernadette,"Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
Bernadette,"Hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
Bernadette,"Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you."
Bernadette,Please just go to the store.
Bernadette,Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
Bernadette,I think I’m in labour.
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Bernadette,Here comes another contraction.
Bernadette,I’m sorry. It’s our first time.
Bernadette,Not that old school. He knows.
Bernadette,We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.
Bernadette,Do you really need to record this?
Bernadette,Raj.
Bernadette,How could you?
Bernadette,Raj.
Bernadette,"Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right."
Bernadette,I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
Bernadette,We could name her after your mom.
Bernadette,Did she have a middle name?
Bernadette,Let’s keep thinking.
Bernadette,I know.
Bernadette,She did always have candy in her pocket.
Bernadette,"I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"
Bernadette,"I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right."
Bernadette,"No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
Bernadette,Hi.
Bernadette,Sorry we’re late.
Bernadette,Really? So you can control it?
Bernadette,I couldn’t explain it if I tried.
Bernadette,It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.
Bernadette,Sure.
Bernadette,"It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking."
Bernadette,"Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?"
Bernadette,It took me two hours to get her down.
Bernadette,That was so fast.
Bernadette,"Yeah, he has a gift."
Bernadette,"Nothing, these are happy tears."
Bernadette,"No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?"
Bernadette,Not funny.
Bernadette,Everyone’s a better mom than me.
Bernadette,How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
Bernadette,Now you hate me too.
Bernadette,"Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now."
Bernadette,"Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
Bernadette,Shh. She’s asleep.
Bernadette,Down here.
Bernadette,I didn’t know what else to do. It worked.
Bernadette,Don’t make me laugh.
Bernadette,I think I live here now. It’s fine.
Bernadette,"Yeah, go ahead."
Bernadette,"Don’t make me cry, either."
Bernadette,"We love you, too."
Bernadette,"I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can."
Bernadette,"Yeah, thanks."
Bernadette,Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
Bernadette,"I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real."
Bernadette,"Uh oh, what’s going on?"
Bernadette,"It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now."
Bernadette,I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
Bernadette,You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark. 
Bernadette,"So, normal."
Bernadette,"You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
Bernadette,"It’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
Bernadette,Wouldn’t that be nice.
Bernadette,I like the first one.
Bernadette,Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?
Bernadette,"Why would you do that, Raj?"
Bernadette,"You’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
Bernadette,I finally got Halley to sleep.
Bernadette,"Let’s see. You’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us."
Bernadette,"For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?"
Bernadette,"Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off."
Bernadette,Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.
Bernadette,"Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back."
Bernadette,"Oh, thank you."
Bernadette,That sounds really nice.
Bernadette,"We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party."
Bernadette,Call if there’s any problems.
Bernadette,Call me. Don’t call Howard.
Bernadette,"Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
Bernadette,"Raj, what’s going on?"
Bernadette,"I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer."
Bernadette,"Stuart, don’t you drink my milk."
Bernadette,You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?
Bernadette,Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we’re all dressed up. Why go home?"
Bernadette,What’s going on with you?
Bernadette,I’m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
Bernadette,You’re upset I had a baby?
Bernadette,"You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I’m constantly worried, I’m always tired, and in a few minutes I’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
Bernadette,"You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great."
Bernadette,"And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice. "
Bernadette,Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.
Bernadette,And there they go.
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s okay. It’s good to get out of the house."
Bernadette,That’s so sweet of you.
Bernadette,"Oh, I’m sure that’s not true."
Bernadette,"Yeah, maybe your dad’s right."
Bernadette,Is it really that high?
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, you really are spoiled."
Bernadette,"When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?"
Bernadette,"I’m sorry, Raj. We really just don’t have the space."
Bernadette,What if you stop helping?
Bernadette,That’s a great idea.
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,Making lasagna.
Bernadette,"You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
Bernadette,"Oh, dear God, you’re cheating on me with Raj. "
Bernadette,What is it?
Bernadette,It’s so hard to say no to you.
Bernadette,So I’ll say maybe.
Bernadette,"You said tickets don’t go on sale till Friday, right?"
Bernadette,"You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
Bernadette,See where I’m going with this?
Bernadette,"If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does."
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
Bernadette,Thank you.
Bernadette,There she goes.
Bernadette,I appreciate it.
Bernadette,He’s such a sweetie. 
Bernadette,"If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
Bernadette,Kinda. 
Bernadette,Howie?
Bernadette,It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done.
Bernadette,And you live here for free.
Bernadette,Keep it. Consider it a gift.
Bernadette,What’s the difference?
Bernadette,You just don’t want to go alone with Sheldon.
Bernadette,What’s so funny?
Bernadette,"Don’t post that, be supportive."
Bernadette,We’re smart. I’m sure we can think of something.
Bernadette,"Oh, we’re smarter than that."
Bernadette,Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.
Bernadette,That sounds awful.
Bernadette,"Not for you, box of towels."
Bernadette,"It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine."
Bernadette,Don’t do that. We’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
Bernadette,"You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
Bernadette,"Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass. "
Bernadette,Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
Bernadette,"Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
Bernadette,"Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
Bernadette,"Well, have you talked to them about it?"
Bernadette,"Look, Raj just gets along with women. "
Bernadette,Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
Bernadette,"Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard."
Bernadette,"Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet."
Bernadette,"You’re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don’t like it, you should just talk to her."
Bernadette,"Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her."
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,No problem.
Bernadette,Okay.
Bernadette,Already cleared the browser history.
Bernadette,Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, I’ll miss Halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine."
Bernadette,And that day care is great.
Bernadette,"Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special."
Bernadette,"It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?"
Bernadette,"Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
Bernadette,"Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner."
Bernadette,Meatloaf.
Bernadette,Stuart made it.
Bernadette,Sounds great.
Bernadette,"Hmm, guess it should be me."
Bernadette,"Of course, why?"
Bernadette,"No, I’m fine."
Bernadette,Fine.
Bernadette,"Love you, too."
Bernadette,"Okay, you won. Can I finish what I’m doing?"
Bernadette,Something on your mind?
Bernadette,"Nope, all good."
Bernadette,"No, what is wrong with you?"
Bernadette,"Howard, I’m sorry if I’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
Bernadette,"No. I didn’t want to tell you, but I’m having a really tough time about going back to work."
Bernadette,It was?
Bernadette,"I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice."
Bernadette,I guess.
Bernadette,I’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
Bernadette,I don’t like when you imitate me.
Bernadette,I’m on the day care’s website.
Bernadette,What if she likes the people who work there more than us?
Bernadette,"When I go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. We don’t know anything about them."
Bernadette,"Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. I’m going back to work after only four months, so I’ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here."
Bernadette,It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.
Bernadette,"Yeah, eventually. She’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
Bernadette,"No, I’ll be fine. "
Bernadette,It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.
Bernadette,"Well, guess I’m ready to go."
Bernadette,You have everything she needs for day care?
Bernadette,"Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
Bernadette,"Stop, you’re gonna make me cry."
Bernadette,"She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care."
Bernadette,"I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is."
Bernadette,"Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done."
Bernadette,"Love you, too. Bye."
Bernadette,You realize they called when you took her.
Bernadette,See? This is the right thing for her. Let’s all just go to work.
Bernadette,"Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go."
Bernadette,"Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
Bernadette,Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head.
Bernadette,"Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone."
Bernadette,So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?
Bernadette,"Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
Bernadette,Is it I’m going to die alone?
Bernadette,Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.
Bernadette,"We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?"
Bernadette,I would never let Howard work with an ex.
Bernadette,I wouldn’t trust her. He’s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.
Bernadette,And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with.
Bernadette,Terrified.
Bernadette,"Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?"
Bernadette,"Seriously, where were you?"
Bernadette,Why?
Bernadette,Oh. What’d she say?
Bernadette,"First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina."
Bernadette,"Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
Bernadette,No. And the little lady has a name.
Bernadette,Tammy Jo St. Cloud.
Bernadette,"Sorry, you’re not a dork.  Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
Bernadette,"Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years.  Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
Bernadette,"Yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
Bernadette,So what happens next?
Bernadette,So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?
Bernadette,"Hey, that’s amazing."
Bernadette,You’re kidding. Why would they do that?
Bernadette,You doing okay?
Bernadette,Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.
Bernadette,You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
Bernadette,Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?
Bernadette,Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
Bernadette,"You’re still gonna go, right?"
Bernadette,"Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram."
Bernadette,"No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage."
Bernadette,"You’re excited about this opportunity, right?"
Bernadette,You have to go.
Bernadette,"I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
Bernadette,"Oh, great."
Bernadette,Oh.
Bernadette,It’s too late for me. Save yourself.
Bernadette,"Come here, let’s talk."
Bernadette,"Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
Bernadette,A little clingy.
Bernadette,"Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
Bernadette,I signed us up for ballroom dance class.
Bernadette,I made us have a baby.
Bernadette,Bring it in.
Bernadette,"That’s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand."
Bernadette,No.
Bernadette,Should we call Amy?
Bernadette,I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
Bernadette,Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?
Bernadette,"Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute."
Bernadette,Which he only did once.
Bernadette,We didn’t want you to worry.
Bernadette,"Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months."
Bernadette,"That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
Bernadette,"Yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down."
Bernadette,"Fine, hundreds."
Bernadette,Can I just squeeze in here?
Bernadette,"I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
Bernadette,To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?
Bernadette,Excuse me.
Bernadette,Let me just put that on vibrate.
Bernadette,"They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow."
Bernadette,Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
Bernadette,My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
Bernadette,My universe!
Bernadette,My universe!
Bernadette,I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
Bernadette,It was an architect!
Bernadette,He didn’t try them yet!
Bernadette,Who is it?
Bernadette,Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
Bernadette,"It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!"
Bernadette,Why can’t she drive herself?
Bernadette,"All right, just hurry!"
Bernadette,Howie? Howie?
Bernadette,Ew. Excuse me.
Bernadette,I don’t sound like that.
Bernadette,"No, it’s not!"
Bernadette,Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
Bernadette,You don’t know his life.
Bernadette,Howard?
Bernadette,"Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?"
Bernadette,"Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here."
Bernadette,Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
Bernadette,No!
Bernadette,"Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on."
Bernadette,Hey.
Bernadette,Why are you being a baby?
Bernadette,"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins."
Bernadette,"Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?"
Bernadette,"Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California."
Bernadette,"I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…"
Bernadette,Earthquake.
Bernadette,"Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while."
Bernadette,"I changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
Bernadette,The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
Bernadette,Howard!
Bernadette,"Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
Bernadette,"Oh, it’s Raj. Everything okay?"
Bernadette,Hello?
Bernadette,"Howie, can you get that?"
Bernadette,Busy like I’ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?
Bernadette,How’s she doing?
Bernadette,"Oh, big daddy, I don’t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now."
Bernadette,"Don’t be that way. If you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh."
Howard,"Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into."
Howard,Wait till you see this.
Howard,It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Howard,It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.
Howard,"Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
Howard,"Hang on, there really is a lady here?"
Howard,And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
Howard,So she’s available for coitus?
Howard,"Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
Howard,Bon douche.
Howard,It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Howard,See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
Howard,"Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women."
Howard,He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?
Howard,"This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
Howard,"Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
Howard,So you’ll think about it?
Howard,Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
Howard,But does it have peanut oil?
Howard,Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
Howard,.
Howard,Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
Howard,Get used to it.
Howard,"He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!"
Howard,"Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
Howard,What’s his problem?
Howard,Been there.
Howard,"Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?"
Howard,She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?
Howard,These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
Howard,"How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…"
Howard,"Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
Howard,"Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
Howard,Done.
Howard,"Alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub."
Howard,"Stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth."
Howard,"Raj, blow up the gates."
Howard,"Don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
Howard,"Leonard, you’ve got one on your tail."
Howard,"Sheldon, he’s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!"
Howard,Leonard look out!
Howard,I am the Swordmaster!
Howard,Sounds like your neighbour’s home.
Howard,"Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. "
Howard,"Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? "
Howard,I’m a romantic.
Howard,Because he looked better than you?
Howard,"I disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. "
Howard,"I don’t know, you guys work in the same lab."
Howard,"There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I’m… a bit of a self-taught expert. "
Howard,"Oh, then you’re probably okay."
Howard,"Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?"
Howard,"Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. "
Howard,"That’s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
Howard,"Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
Howard,I smell robot. 
Howard,"So, how did it go with Lesley? "
Howard,"Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick."
Howard,"Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. "
Howard,Right. Sorry.
Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,"Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
Howard,Oh yeah.
Howard,"Hey, look who’s come out…."
Howard,"Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla."
Howard,"Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?"
Howard,What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
Howard,I’ll take the heart smart platter.
Howard,And walks in quiet beauty like the night. 
Howard,"If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. "
Howard,What’s the matter?
Howard,How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.
Howard,"Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!"
Howard,The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. 
Howard,I put it there. 
Howard,That was absolutely humiliating.
Howard,"Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party. "
Howard,"I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. "
Howard,Morning ma’am. 
Howard,A boy-girl party?
Howard,"As in, costumes? "
Howard,"Gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
Howard,"No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. "
Howard,"I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood. "
Howard,"Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. "
Howard,"What, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
Howard,I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
Howard,"No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights. "
Howard,"Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough. "
Howard,"I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together."
Howard,"You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. "
Howard,"If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat."
Howard,"No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
Howard,"Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?"
Howard,"He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God. "
Howard,I’m supposed to give him a ride home.
Howard,"Watch this, it’s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter."
Howard,No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
Howard,No.
Howard,If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time. 
Howard,"See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck."
Howard,"Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry, I’ll have it cleaned."
Howard,"In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t."
Howard,More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! 
Howard,"Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
Howard,In here my lady.
Howard,chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
Howard,"Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me."
Howard,"I do not, my mother lives with me. "
Howard,"So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz? "
Howard,"I’m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz."
Howard,Anything you want.
Howard,When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.
Howard,"Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!"
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash. "
Howard,What are you guys doing here? 
Howard,"So, Halo night, huh? "
Howard,"Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle. "
Howard,"Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack! "
Howard,Guess whose parents just got broadband. 
Howard,"Neither do I. Doogie Howser’s been off the air for like, twenty years. "
Howard,I bet they love Scrubs.
Howard,It’s the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
Howard,"Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally. "
Howard,Let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.
Howard,So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Howard,Give me the phone.
Howard,Just give it to me. 
Howard,"Don’t worry, you’ll thank me.  You may now thank me. "
Howard,"Fine, next time make your own date."
Howard,Worked for my parents. 
Howard,I’d like to try a slippery nipple. 
Howard,"No, no, let’s see how long it takes him."
Howard,Worked for my parents. 
Howard,"I’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. "
Howard,"Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. "
Howard,"Oh, no it isn’t. "
Howard,"Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but… "
Howard,And you have no wrath. 
Howard,"I’ll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks. "
Howard,"Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this . "
Howard,Are we ready on the stereo? 
Howard,"No problem, turning it down.  et voila. "
Howard,Public access enabled. 
Howard,"The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv. "
Howard,That would be me. 
Howard,I’m with you. I just have to make sure if I’m a synthetic human I’d still be Jewish. I promised my mother. 
Howard,"I don’t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary. "
Howard,Forget the parties? What a nerd. 
Howard,"I’ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed…."
Howard,Oh no he dit’nt!
Howard,"I just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
Howard,"It’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine. "
Howard,"Let’s roll. Hey, nice suit."
Howard,More often than you’d think.
Howard,"That would be me. Hey, check it out, it’s a featured video. . "
Howard,"Uh-oh, here comes “the talk.” "
Howard,Uh-huh?
Howard,Okay. So what’s up? 
Howard,"Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you’re Bogarding the symposium. "
Howard,"No, no, you’re quark-blocking us. "
Howard,Wow.
Howard,"No, it’s okay, it’s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. "
Howard,"Yeah, uh, break a leg."
Howard,"So, road trip to Long Beach."
Howard,I’m game.
Howard,"I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone."
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,How can I ask them when I’m talking to you!  Hello.
Howard,"Dear Lord, not Milky Green! "
Howard,It’s Leonard.
Howard,Sheldon’s sick.
Howard,"For God’s sake, Ma, I’m twenty six years old."
Howard,Chocolate milk and eggoes please! 
Howard,"Hang on, call waiting."
Howard,Hello.
Howard,Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.
Howard,"It’s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06. "
Howard,"Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?"
Howard,That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today. 
Howard,"Look at this, everyone went chimp. "
Howard,Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. 
Howard,Sorry.  Found ‘em. 
Howard,"Sorry, don’t you have a spare."
Howard,"Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. "
Howard,Well?
Howard,I’m not going in there.
Howard,"It’s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We’ll be your eyes. "
Howard,"One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
Howard,"No, you’ll be on your hands and knees. Now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon’s room. "
Howard,Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
Howard,It means go straight.
Howard,"You don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true. "
Howard,"Because you didn’t keep true.  Okay, turn right. "
Howard,"Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  That’s it, now just keep true. Alright, you’re close enough to Sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on."
Howard,No.
Howard,"Oh, I guess you didn’t. "
Howard,Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. 
Howard,"Hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your head back.  "
Howard,"Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? "
Howard,Antonio Salieri?
Howard,"You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. "
Howard,We liked Leonard.
Howard,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Howard,"I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello."
Howard,A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle. 
Howard,"When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. "
Howard,"No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf. "
Howard,"Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering."
Howard,Sheldon.
Howard,Go away. 
Howard,"No, I thought of it all by myself. "
Howard,"Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard."
Howard,Then our problem would be solved. 
Howard,"We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available."
Howard,The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
Howard,What about biology? 
Howard,"You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. "
Howard,"Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. "
Howard,"No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. "
Howard,We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. 
Howard,Smooth.
Howard,All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. 
Howard,Or can we?
Howard,I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t. 
Howard,"Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
Howard,"No, I have allergies. "
Howard,"Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. "
Howard,"Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. "
Howard,Did anyone see how he did it?
Howard,He’s back.
Howard,I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. 
Howard,"Yeah, let’s go with that. "
Howard,"Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. "
Howard,"Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him."
Howard,"Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There’s going to be a scene depicting Spock’s birth. "
Howard,Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
Howard,"Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. "
Howard,"They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. "
Howard,Recognise. 
Howard,Kryptonian villain. Long story.
Howard,What? Why?
Howard,Outweigh the needs of the few. 
Howard,"How about the perpetual motion squad? It’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. "
Howard,"Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
Howard,Fire away. 
Howard,"Hey, I buzzed in. "
Howard,Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
Howard,Some of us might have the correct answers too. 
Howard,"Alright, that’s it."
Howard,Okay. 
Howard,He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve. 
Howard,So who’d he get to be on his team.
Howard,"That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. "
Howard,So?
Howard,"Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
Howard,"Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems. "
Howard,Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.
Howard,Hit that thang. 
Howard,"Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. "
Howard,"Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. "
Howard,Yes.
Howard,Sheldon. 
Howard,"All night long, y’all! "
Howard,"760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
Howard,It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell. 
Howard,Then guess.
Howard,He doesn’t have it. He’s got squat.
Howard,A time machine from the movie The Time Machine? 
Howard,"Oh, that’s cool."
Howard,Do you have $800?
Howard,"Don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping."
Howard,You lucky duck. 
Howard,Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.
Howard,"It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. "
Howard,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. 
Howard,"Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby’s broken. "
Howard,Talk about your chick magnets. 
Howard,"You can’t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that? "
Howard,I was going to put down a towel. 
Howard,"Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson."
Howard,"And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”"
Howard,"Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage. "
Howard,"You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana. "
Howard,"Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection."
Howard,Well you can’t just call dibs.
Howard,Will you forget dibs! 
Howard,"Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here. "
Howard,I guess that makes me large breasts. 
Howard,Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon’s office. 
Howard,Don’t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot. 
Howard,Well she’s free to examine my briefs.
Howard,"I know, I’m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again. "
Howard,"Sorry I’m late, I’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
Howard,"Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM!  Howard Wolowitz. "
Howard,Yeah. 
Howard,"Well, I think you’re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole. "
Howard,"Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny. "
Howard,"Destiny, thy name is Anaheim. "
Howard,"Come on, Shelly, she’s family."
Howard,"I’ll walk you to your car. You’re in structure 3 level C, right? "
Howard,"Ha-ha, not your eyebrows? "
Howard,Can I get a hallelujah. 
Howard,Hallelujah. 
Howard,"Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog. "
Howard,You still have to wear a helmet. 
Howard,"Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You’re welcome!"
Howard,Bye Missy.
Howard,"Okay, you two have to back off."
Howard,"So what, you’ve already got Penny. "
Howard,So I can have Penny?
Howard,"I’m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas! "
Howard,"I’m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp. "
Howard,Who are you to decide that?
Howard,Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? 
Howard,"Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
Howard,"Look, we have to settle this."
Howard,"Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. "
Howard,You want to go again? Let’s go. 
Howard,Okay. 
Howard,"Come on, come on, get up. "
Howard,"I’m fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy. "
Howard,The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
Howard,"Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. "
Howard,Okay. 
Howard,It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. 
Howard,"Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom’s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
Howard,Actually that was last year. 
Howard,"You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. "
Howard,Did someone say party? 
Howard,"I suppose that’s possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one."
Howard,"Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. I’m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? "
Howard,What difference does it make?
Howard,Can you just let us in.
Howard,"Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross’s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics."
Howard,"Okay, well, he might like that, I’ve seen him… chilly. "
Howard,Don’t ask.
Howard,Too late.
Howard,Told you not to ask. 
Howard,Try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention. 
Howard,Just do it. 
Howard,He came with a manual. 
Howard,No problem.
Howard,What if they’re women?
Howard,How’s it going?
Howard,"So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner."
Howard,"No, you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. "
Howard,"Come on, afterwards there’s a Q & A with Harrison Ford’s body double. "
Howard,Can’t you play him some other time?
Howard,"Oh my God, do you smell gas."
Howard,"Yeah, no. "
Howard,"This granola bar, there’s peanuts in it."
Howard,"I don’t know, it was just there."
Howard,"Don’t yell at me, I’ve got to go to the emergency room. "
Howard,"No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. "
Howard,"Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh….  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it’s out of the washer. I’ll call you when it’s in the dryer. "
Howard,Excuse me.
Howard,"No, listen, see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and I’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours."
Howard,"No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I’m allergic to peanuts. "
Howard,"Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. "
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"No, you don’t understand."
Howard,"Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people. "
Howard,"Bad, very bad. "
Howard,We can’t go home. 
Howard,"Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. "
Howard,I don’t think I can. 
Howard,"Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now. "
Howard,"Leonard’s fine. I’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way. "
Howard,"Look, I’ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don’t know how to stop him. "
Howard,"Don’t toy with me, woman. "
Howard,Thy will be done. 
Howard,Pees hep me! 
Howard,Fank-u. 
Howard,I really don’t think the colonoscopy was necessary. 
Howard,"Oh, right, it’s your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it’s all over now."
Howard,Maybe.
Howard,Are you mad?
Howard,"Yeah, that’s why I did it. "
Howard,"No, it’s Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. "
Howard,What’s this? 
Howard,Well it’s not.
Howard,"You know, I’m really glad you decided to learn Mandarin."
Howard,Once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. 
Howard,You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. 
Howard,"Not now, I have a blog to find. "
Howard,"It’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?"
Howard,"Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. "
Howard,"Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. "
Howard,Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm. 
Howard,"What, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?"
Howard,"For God’s sake, Sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken."
Howard,"Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. "
Howard,"Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?"
Howard,"You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. "
Howard,"No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”"
Howard,"Oh really, did you make a second date."
Howard,"Good, ‘cos they don’t work. "
Howard,"Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
Howard,Give him time.
Howard,And some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
Howard,That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. 
Howard,"Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? "
Howard,Did you make fun of trains? 
Howard,Bye  
Howard,Who is it?
Howard,Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? 
Howard,Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench? 
Howard,Do you want to switch?
Howard,"Get out of bed, we’re switching."
Howard,Just get in the bed!
Howard,We’re just talking ma. 
Howard,"For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night!  Comfy now?"
Howard,So don’t look at it.
Howard,No kidding?
Howard,What about Lee Meriwether?
Howard,Well I’m glad that’s settled. 
Howard,"Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep."
Howard,Oh for God’s sake.
Howard,"Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it. "
Howard,Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
Howard,"I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation."
Howard,Hello.
Howard,"Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward."
Howard,Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
Howard,"So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?"
Howard,You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
Howard,"It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl."
Howard,Like who?
Howard,I’d hit that.
Howard,"Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
Howard,You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
Howard,"Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume."
Howard,"Hmm, let’s do it. "
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Let her rip.
Howard,That’s what makes it get all funky.
Howard,What the frak?
Howard,Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
Howard,Me too. But probably in a different way.
Howard,I do that too. But probably in a different way.
Howard,"Mmmm, testify. "
Howard,I’ll take the bullet.
Howard,"Yes, you are."
Howard,Creepy good or creepy bad?
Howard,"That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I’m not necessarily talking to the food."
Howard,So what’s your news?
Howard,"Oh, I’d so do her."
Howard,Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
Howard,"Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley."
Howard,"Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
Howard,You were a colossal ass-hat.
Howard,He can feel sadness?
Howard,"Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that."
Howard,"Oh crap, that’s terrifying."
Howard,Try less teeth. 
Howard,We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
Howard,Dr Gablehauser.
Howard,"Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe."
Howard,Told you.
Howard,I have a master’s degree.
Howard,They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
Howard,"Oh, gee, thanks."
Howard,"Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it."
Howard,That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.
Howard,"Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them."
Howard,"I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis."
Howard,"Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English."
Howard,So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
Howard,"It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons."
Howard,"Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle."
Howard,Lucky?
Howard,"Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue."
Howard,"So, not a puppy?"
Howard,"Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point."
Howard,"Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane."
Howard,"And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties."
Howard,And he should know a lot of women.
Howard,"No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side."
Howard,"Oh damn, I picked the wrong side."
Howard,And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
Howard,This madness has to stop.
Howard,"Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. "
Howard,"Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
Howard,"The application in your hand, give it to her."
Howard,"Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?"
Howard,"Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up."
Howard,This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
Howard,I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…
Howard,"Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena."
Howard,What?
Howard,"Fine, what colour do you want?"
Howard,Black it is.
Howard,Oh.
Howard,Oh God!
Howard,Really? Why?
Howard,"Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait."
Howard,"Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System."
Howard,Woof.
Howard,"You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well."
Howard,I do. I love me a cup of joe.
Howard,"Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
Howard,"To watch, right?"
Howard,"Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis."
Howard,I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
Howard,My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
Howard,Her loss. Let’s go.
Howard,"Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings."
Howard,I have Chorrr.
Howard,Nekhmakh.
Howard,And Kreplach.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Well, as it turns out, it’s also a Klingon word."
Howard,"Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling."
Howard,Did you pay your cable bill?
Howard,"What do you mean, aw? Like she didn’t know we were nerds?"
Howard,Look at those women.
Howard,"Oh, look, the’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz."
Howard,Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
Howard,House? What house?
Howard,"A house, where?"
Howard,"Wait a minute, you’re telling me that I’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?"
Howard,And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
Howard,"Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed."
Howard,"Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz."
Howard,Giselle’s hanging by a thread.
Howard,Then you’re not invited to our wedding.
Howard,Just put it back before he comes!
Howard,"Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence."
Howard,"You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class."
Howard,"One of us, one of us."
Howard,So based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.
Howard,"When we find it, you want to go with us?"
Howard,That’s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
Howard,"Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models."
Howard,I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
Howard,"That’s it. There’s the house, I found America’s top models!"
Howard,"Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style."
Howard,"Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over."
Howard,"It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops."
Howard,"No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online."
Howard,Voila!
Howard,What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.
Howard,"God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark."
Howard,"You know what? If it’s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I’m creepy."
Howard,"Yes, we here to fix the cable."
Howard,That’s what I meant.
Howard,She’s taller than all the women in my family combined.
Howard,Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
Howard,"Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable."
Howard,"Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs."
Howard,"A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?"
Howard,"Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? "
Howard,Ow.
Howard,"Oh, thank God, you’re here."
Howard,I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
Howard,On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
Howard,"Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in."
Howard,"Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish."
Howard,"No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”"
Howard,"I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance."
Howard,"Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?"
Howard,"Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home."
Howard,I’ll call ya.
Howard,My mother is so gonna love her.
Howard,Anything?
Howard,"Hang on, there’s got to be other options."
Howard,"OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B."
Howard,"Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
Howard,Thank God for Plan B.
Howard,"No, you’re mistaken."
Howard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Howard,"Well, that does sound like me, but no."
Howard,Okay.
Howard,It’s Leonard!
Howard,"No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?"
Howard,How do we decide that?
Howard,Sheldon.
Howard,Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
Howard,"Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me."
Howard,Sheldon?
Howard,Lisa?
Howard,"Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!"
Howard,"So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get."
Howard,"Anyway, call me. It’s Howard."
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Howard,I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
Howard,"Oh, I don’t think you can."
Howard,Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
Howard,Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
Howard,And a three hour dinner with Penny.
Howard,"Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes."
Howard,"I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
Howard,Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
Howard,New pants?
Howard,Nice. Cotton?
Howard,"So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious."
Howard,"Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
Howard,A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.
Howard,She’s not my type.
Howard,She was?
Howard,Hey. Nice sweater.
Howard,"You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible."
Howard,Good for you.
Howard,What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
Howard,I don’t know. Kryptonian mustard.
Howard,"Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?"
Howard,"Okay, he’s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration."
Howard,"Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once."
Howard,"Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon."
Howard,No.
Howard,"Did, too."
Howard,"Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy."
Howard,That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!
Howard,There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
Howard,Where were you?
Howard,"Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard’s got a new BFF."
Howard,So? We’re in a rock band.
Howard,Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.
Howard,"Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special."
Howard,"And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about."
Howard,"Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights."
Howard,It’s happening to us.
Howard,"You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick."
Howard,"Come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation."
Howard,"Excuse me, we’re ready."
Howard,This one. Let’s go.
Howard,"I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!"
Howard,See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.
Howard,Why couldn’t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
Howard,"All right, that’s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or…"
Howard,"Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
Howard,"All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something."
Howard,"Gentlemen, goggles."
Howard,"Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte."
Howard,It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
Howard,"Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl."
Howard,How is doable anything but a compliment?
Howard,"Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango."
Howard,"The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot."
Howard,"Um, so what are you saying?"
Howard,"Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious."
Howard,Thanks for the heads up.
Howard,"I’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
Howard,"Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!"
Howard,"I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university."
Howard,I don’t want to talk to anybody.
Howard,I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
Howard,"Cherry, please!"
Howard,You make me want to kill myself.
Howard,Who?
Howard,I don’t want to talk to her.
Howard,Ma!
Howard,I’m fine.
Howard,People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
Howard,"Fine, you’re sorry. Good-bye."
Howard,"Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself."
Howard,"And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show."
Howard,"Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…"
Howard,"I guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin’ ’bout Marcy…"
Howard,Grossman.
Howard,And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
Howard,Look at me. What chance do I have if I don’t try too hard?
Howard,I guess.
Howard,You really think so?
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,"Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub."
Howard,Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
Howard,"Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
Howard,"Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex."
Howard,"Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache."
Howard,"I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!"
Howard,"Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
Howard,"Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…"
Howard,What a jerk.
Howard,Even twenty thousand of ’em.
Howard,"C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke."
Howard,"That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
Howard,"Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune."
Howard,Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
Howard,I can fix it.
Howard,Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?
Howard,"Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… "
Howard,How much time you got?
Howard,"Me, me. Let it be me."
Howard,Guilty as charged. I’m out.
Howard,Oh come on. What do I have to do?
Howard,"Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?"
Howard,You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
Howard,There are too many variables. It would take forever.
Howard,Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.
Howard,"Okay, I guess we only have one option."
Howard,See ya.
Howard,It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
Howard,He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
Howard,"Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?"
Howard,He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
Howard,Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
Howard,"Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?"
Howard,You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.
Howard,What is it?
Howard,"Ooh, double sixes."
Howard,"Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little."
Howard,"Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?"
Howard,"Well, there you go. Problem solved."
Howard,"Come on, Leonard, let’s go"
Howard,Okay.  
Howard,Maybe we should have your head notarized.
Howard,"Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound."
Howard,Not a clue.
Howard,"How about that, you were right."
Howard,"So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister."
Howard,"I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields."
Howard,"So, she’s close to curing diabetes?"
Howard,"Wow, you must be very proud."
Howard,"You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer."
Howard,"Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad."
Howard,"Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?"
Howard,"It’s just temporary, I pay rent."
Howard,Say what?  That’s basically what I just said.
Howard,"Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship."
Howard,Why is it always my responsibility?
Howard,I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
Howard,We’ll talk about this later.
Howard,That was close.
Howard,"Yeah, still funny, Raj."
Howard,But what about the creek bed?
Howard,"I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic."
Howard,No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
Howard,Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
Howard,I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!
Howard,"Oh, Leslie, thank God."
Howard,"Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?"
Howard,Sorry.
Howard,"Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
Howard,All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
Howard,It kind of does.
Howard,I agree. How exactly do we do that? 
Howard,War is hell.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"That’s great, Leslie. Thanks."
Howard,"Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
Howard,"Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history."
Howard,"Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something."
Howard,In the paintball shed! Twice!
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry about that."
Howard,"Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free."
Howard,"Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful."
Howard,"Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
Howard,Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
Howard,"That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail."
Howard,"Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out."
Howard,"You know, most people don’t get that."
Howard,"Oh, great."
Howard,"I’m busy, Ma!"
Howard,"Don’t come in, Ma!"
Howard,"Oh, there’s the arrhythmia."
Howard,Are you Jewish?
Howard,Yes!
Howard,"You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here.  Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy."
Howard,"I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu."
Howard,"What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?"
Howard,"Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider."
Howard,"Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…"
Howard,Bye.
Howard,Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
Howard,"Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not."
Howard,"When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date."
Howard,Thanks.
Howard,What about it?
Howard,When did that happen?
Howard,"Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?"
Howard,"Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable."
Howard,Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
Howard,How so?
Howard,"So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!"
Howard,What’s the plan?
Howard,"Okay, see you."
Howard,"Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver."
Howard,For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
Howard,"Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much."
Howard,"Come on, Raj."
Howard,It can’t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
Howard,"Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I’ve actually got a shot at a Terminator."
Howard,"You’re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz."
Howard,"Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works."
Howard,That’s Summer Glau.
Howard,That’s it.
Howard,"Um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first."
Howard,"Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I’m sober."
Howard,"Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
Howard,"Fine, go ahead. Take a shot."
Howard,"I will, I’m just working on my opening line."
Howard,"No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature."
Howard,"Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalon."
Howard,What?
Howard,What’s going on?
Howard,"Placebo, you say. Interesting."
Howard,Raj.
Howard,Look.
Howard,You tell me.
Howard,"Hi, I’m the small package good things come in."
Howard,"So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?"
Howard,I’ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
Howard,"And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?"
Howard,"Okay, here’s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you’d be Summer Winter."
Howard,"Okay, I’m going to just go for broke here and say I like you."
Howard,"So here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you’d say yes?"
Howard,Fair enough. I’ll leave you in peace.
Howard,"But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?"
Howard,"Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?"
Howard,Terminator broke my phone.
Howard,"Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?"
Howard,"Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up."
Howard,"Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess."
Howard,You underestimate me.
Howard,I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
Howard,Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
Howard,You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
Howard,Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
Howard,"Uh, I’ve seen this before."
Howard,"It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump."
Howard,"Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work."
Howard,Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
Howard,We add Bluetooth!
Howard,And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
Howard,"They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans."
Howard,"Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
Howard,"Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?"
Howard,"1,000 friggin’ Penny Blossoms."
Howard,That’s your entire profit margin.
Howard,You can’t be serious.
Howard,"Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives."
Howard,"Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid."
Howard,"All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today."
Howard,"So, there is a number."
Howard,"I’ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift."
Howard,"Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy."
Howard,"Oh, actually I’m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she’s also my maid."
Howard,"I won’t lie, it’s pretty dope."
Howard,"Oh, pish-posh.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while."
Howard,"Yeah, what’s the occasion?"
Howard,I’ll run lines with you in the car.
Howard,Yum. Starving.
Howard,"Oh, my God! Girl fight! "
Howard,I know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
Howard,May I say you look very comely tonight?
Howard,"You’re right, this filly’s been broken."
Howard,"According to Alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI."
Howard,Here we go.
Howard,"Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately."
Howard,"If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots."
Howard,Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
Howard,"Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient."
Howard,"Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
Howard,"I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex."
Howard,"Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar."
Howard,"Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle."
Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon."
Howard,"Yes, but I saw it from the front."
Howard,"Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection."
Howard,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
Howard,You let go.
Howard,It’s my comic book!
Howard,I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
Howard,Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
Howard,So what are you kids up to?
Howard,"See you, Stuart."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,Really?
Howard,Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
Howard,"Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs."
Howard,"No, he may not."
Howard,I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
Howard,Wrong again!
Howard,"Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
Howard,"All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo."
Howard,"It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
Howard,"That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine."
Howard,"Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week."
Howard,"Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
Howard,"You got it, sir."
Howard,"No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires."
Howard,Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
Howard,"I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine."
Howard,"Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card."
Howard,"I do, all the time."
Howard,"Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?"
Howard,You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
Howard,"Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
Howard,"Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go.  Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped."
Howard,"Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?"
Howard,Were you in the original trilogy?
Howard,Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
Howard,"So, where were we?"
Howard,"No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?"
Howard,"Great, just start."
Howard,She dumped me!
Howard,"I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
Howard,"Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!"
Howard,I don’t want to go anywhere.
Howard,"It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now that…"
Howard,Now? Right now?
Howard,I say Vegas baby!
Howard,"Sea World, baby!"
Howard,"Black case, top compartment."
Howard,"First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
Howard,"You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email."
Howard,"Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her."
Howard,"Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you."
Howard,"Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?"
Howard,"Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?"
Howard,I’m going back to the room.
Howard,"Hi there, Howard Wolowitz."
Howard,"Really, me too."
Howard,Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
Howard,"Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?"
Howard,"She’s a hooker, isn’t she."
Howard,You already gave her the money?
Howard,Thank you!
Howard,"They’re on me today, boys."
Howard,"No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System."
Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
Howard,"Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."
Howard,"Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?"
Howard,Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
Howard,"Guys, we have a code red."
Howard,"Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
Howard,It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
Howard,"Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box."
Howard,No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
Howard,"I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them."
Howard,"Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
Howard,"All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station."
Howard,"Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
Howard,"Classified, Leonard."
Howard,You don’t know what this is?
Howard,Good. Get out.
Howard,"No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
Howard,"Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself."
Howard,Speaking of what goes around comes around…
Howard,"Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?"
Howard,"Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod."
Howard,"Sheldon, I know what I’m doing."
Howard,Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
Howard,Where are you going?
Howard,"Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
Howard,"I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware."
Howard,"Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations."
Howard,"Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. "
Howard,Not enough bread crumbs.
Howard,"Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
Howard,"Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works."
Howard,Meatloaf.
Howard,That’s classified.
Howard,"Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon."
Howard,We could sit on the left side of the couch.
Howard,Godspeed.
Howard,To the North Pole?
Howard,Really?
Howard,"We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
Howard,"We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
Howard,"Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”"
Howard,I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
Howard,So you guys are seriously considering this?
Howard,And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
Howard,"Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine."
Howard,For this I went to MIT.
Howard,"Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued."
Howard,You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.
Howard,"Okay, why?"
Howard,"Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17."
Howard,"Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?"
Howard,I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!
Howard,What?
Howard,Crossbow.
Howard,"Yeah, wow."
Howard,"Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?"
Howard,There’s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
Howard,I can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
Howard,"Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back."
Howard,Great.
Howard,Damn his Vulcan hearing.
Howard,"Okay, Sheldon, sit down."
Howard,"Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole."
Howard,And we agreed to never speak of it again.
Howard,He’s speaking about it.
Howard,"Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
Howard,"That’s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
Howard,"Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
Howard,We had to.
Howard,"Actually, it was his idea."
Howard,Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
Howard,"If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know."
Howard,"Personally, I don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
Howard,What are you doing?
Howard,"Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away."
Howard,"Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we’re done."
Howard,"Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had."
Howard,This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Howard,"No, I want to blend in."
Howard,"Howdy, ma’am."
Howard,Thank you kindly.
Howard,"If y’all don’t mind, I got a hankerin’ for a Lone Star beer."
Howard,Sorry. I’ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
Howard,Again.
Howard,"Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws."
Howard,"Okay, first of all…"
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,"Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?"
Howard,"You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended."
Howard,"What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy."
Howard,"Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?"
Howard,Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
Howard,Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.
Howard,You are the authority on just fine.
Howard,"Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out."
Howard,"No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them."
Howard,Sounds like a cricket.
Howard,"Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?"
Howard,"Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket."
Howard,"No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin."
Howard,"Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket."
Howard,"What’s the matter, you chicken?"
Howard,"Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me."
Howard,"I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue."
Howard,Hmm.
Howard,Shh!
Howard,Shh! Elevator shaft.
Howard,Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
Howard,Let’s open her up.
Howard,"Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it."
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose."
Howard,"That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?"
Howard,Shiksa. Shik-sa.
Howard,"Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again."
Howard,"All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor"
Howard,You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.
Howard,"No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question."
Howard,"Well, could you look at Toby?"
Howard,Yes!
Howard,No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
Howard,"No, no. I’m going out like this. "
Howard,"They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery."
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
Howard,"Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring."
Howard,"Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
Howard,It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
Howard,"Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?"
Howard,What?
Howard,"Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
Howard,I’m actually much morelost than he is.
Howard,Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
Howard,I’m Howard.
Howard,"Nice to meet you, Bethany."
Howard,"Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music."
Howard,"Yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
Howard,Oy vay.
Howard,"Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
Howard,Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap.
Howard,Okay.
Howard,We are fun people.
Howard,Did you bring the black condoms?
Howard,Let’s go.
Howard,Not particularly.
Howard,"Uh, yeah!"
Howard,She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
Howard,"Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog."
Howard,"You know  Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!"
Howard,"Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please."
Howard,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Howard,"I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!"
Howard,What comes after the stencil?
Howard,"Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
Howard,"No, I haven’t, look.  I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
Howard,"Yeah, I think I covered that."
Howard,"We’re not goth, we’re just guys."
Howard,Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
Howard,What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
Howard,"Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
Howard,What’s that got to do with the story?
Howard,"Fine, they smelled good."
Howard,Whatever.
Howard,"No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
Howard,"Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
Howard,We say they’re in a very intimate area.
Howard,"Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
Howard,"True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls."
Howard,"Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
Howard,Could happen.
Howard,"Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?"
Howard,Celebrating Columbus Day.
Howard,"Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
Howard,Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.
Howard,"Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?  All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills."
Howard,"Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
Howard,"The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
Howard,"Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
Howard,"Okay, she’s gone."
Howard,So?
Howard,"Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?"
Howard,"Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview."
Howard,What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?
Howard,I’m really going to miss you.
Howard,"Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?"
Howard,"Tell you what, we’ll skype."
Howard,Hello.
Howard,Am I interrupting?
Howard,Guess I should have called.
Howard,Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
Howard,But he’s working with Sheldon.
Howard,Want me to leave?
Howard,"Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city."
Howard,"Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize."
Howard,Top o’ the mornin’o ya!
Howard,"Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour."
Howard,"By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard."
Howard,"What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
Howard,"Sure. ‘sup, homes?"
Howard,"Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
Howard,Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.
Howard,"Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
Howard,"All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka."
Howard,Unless you have the carrot power.
Howard,Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Howard,"Well, I guess game’s over."
Howard,Not Ka. Ka-ah.
Howard,"That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you."
Howard,"You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
Howard,"So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?"
Howard,Why not?
Howard,"Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works."
Howard,"So, have you talked to Penny yet?"
Howard,Why not?
Howard,"Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up."
Howard,"Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat."
Howard,"Leonard, come on."
Howard,A hot friend.
Howard,And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
Howard,"So, tell me more about the future mother of my children."
Howard,Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
Howard,"Good, good."
Howard,Six if you count Klingon.
Howard,What?
Howard,"So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?"
Howard,"Oh, cool. So you could study me."
Howard,Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
Howard,And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.
Howard,Do you like science-fiction?
Howard,Role-playing games?
Howard,Either.
Howard,You like magic?
Howard,Okay.
Howard,How about computers? Do you like computers?
Howard,Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
Howard,Of course it did.
Howard,"I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over."
Howard,Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
Howard,My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
Howard,You live with your mother?
Howard,"Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children."
Howard,"Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?"
Howard,Corolla!
Howard,More wine?
Howard,"Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime."
Howard,A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.
Howard,It’s a date.
Howard,Kites ho!
Howard,Good guess.
Howard,Whoa! Did you see that?
Howard,"That chick, she smiled at me."
Howard,"Yes, she did."
Howard,Hold my line.
Howard,What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
Howard,I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.
Howard,I totally had a shot.
Howard,"Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
Howard,But I had a shot with that jogger.
Howard,It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
Howard,"All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there."
Howard,Sheldon knows football?
Howard,"I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?"
Howard,"Hey, pal."
Howard,I brought you a little gift. New kite.
Howard,"Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?"
Howard,"Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be."
Howard,Stipulated.
Howard,"I know, I know."
Howard,"Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
Howard,"Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk."
Howard,"No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself."
Howard,"Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want."
Howard,Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
Howard,"Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go."
Howard,"My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie."
Howard,"Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?"
Howard,No. This is our day.
Howard,"Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that."
Howard,You think so?
Howard,"Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me."
Howard,Really?
Howard,Bye.
Howard,"Oh, take all the time you need."
Howard,"Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore."
Howard,Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
Howard,Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It’ll help take your mind off things.
Howard,"No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line."
Howard,"But if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?"
Howard,"Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off."
Howard,I didn’t know you were upset about that.
Howard,"Okay, sorry."
Howard,I said I’m sorry.
Howard,"Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”"
Howard,"Hey, don’t bring my mother into this!"
Howard,"Boy, what got him so upset?"
Howard,"I’m busy too, you answer it."
Howard,"For God’s sake, I don’t need to hear that! Can’t you just say, I’m busy?"
Howard,"You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
Howard,"There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
Howard,How much time do we have?
Howard,Anything yet?
Howard,"Hang on, how about now?"
Howard,"Ooh, Real Sex."
Howard,"Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed."
Howard,"Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex."
Howard,"Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
Howard,"Oh I don’t know, 50, 55."
Howard,I am.
Howard,"Look, they gave me homemade cookies."
Howard,"Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap."
Howard,Cookie?
Howard,Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
Howard,"Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
Howard,"So, when do the meteors get here?"
Howard,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
Howard,I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
Howard,It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
Howard,"To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie."
Howard,Anything?
Howard,No! What about Slim Jims?
Howard,"Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?"
Howard,Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
Howard,"Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
Howard,"Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
Howard,"Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack."
Howard,"You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
Howard,Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
Howard,That’s still not funny.
Howard,And she was my second cousin.
Howard,You’re a real douche.
Howard,"So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”"
Howard,"Well, see, it took two years for the snail to…  not important."
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"To be honest, I was hoping at least second base."
Howard,"A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
Howard,"No, I was just… never mind."
Howard,We do?
Howard,You’re kidding.
Howard,"Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
Howard,"You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
Howard,Three dates means sex? Who knew?
Howard,"Greetings, homies, homette."
Howard,"In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
Howard,"Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
Howard,"Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
Howard,"Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
Howard,Did she say something?
Howard,"I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type."
Howard,"Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
Howard,"Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica."
Howard,"Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
Howard,"Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to."
Howard,"Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?  Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too."
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Howard,So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking lovely as always.
Howard,"Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap."
Howard,"Thank you. So, shall we get started?"
Howard,You want to play Cylon and colonist?
Howard,"You mean, Bernadette?"
Howard,"I know, but she’s not you."
Howard,Really? Tall?
Howard,Ouch.
Howard,I’m taking a bath!
Howard,"Don’t remind me!  Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go."
Howard,"Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?"
Howard,Why not?
Howard,"Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you."
Howard,"This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?"
Howard,"No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
Howard,No.
Howard,I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
Howard,Fair enough. When’s your break?
Howard,Don’t you just hate when this happens?
Howard,"I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong.   Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…"
Howard,"Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette."
Howard,"Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles."
Howard,"I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner."
Howard,"Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
Howard,Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
Howard,Yeah?
Howard,What?
Howard,"Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette."
Howard,"Have no idea. Hey, Leonard."
Howard,Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
Howard,Like Hanukkah in July.
Howard,No.
Howard,"Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
Howard,"Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?"
Howard,Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
Howard,"Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
Howard,Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
Howard,"Not so far, but that’s not the point!"
Howard,"I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy."
Howard,Huh?
Howard,"Oh, that explains a lot."
Howard,Of course.
Howard,"That’s great, Ma!"
Howard,"No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?"
Howard,Please? I got a real hankering.
Howard,"Thanks, Ma."
Howard,Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
Howard,Then get the regular!
Howard,Sorry about that.
Howard,I’m already on vibrate.
Howard,"Uh, what do you mean?"
Howard,Really? He said that?
Howard,Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
Howard,"I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra."
Howard,"Okay, I got a bone to pick with you."
Howard,"I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
Howard,"We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you."
Howard,"Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
Howard,"I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
Howard,"Come on, do I have to think of everything?"
Howard,Hi.
Howard,Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.
Howard,"I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
Howard,"Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not."
Howard,Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
Howard,But I now realize how foolish that is.
Howard,It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?
Howard,"Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance."
Howard,What? No.
Howard,Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
Howard,"No, really. I have a girlfriend now."
Howard,She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
Howard,"Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend."
Howard,What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
Howard,"Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist."
Howard,"If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts."
Howard,"Yes, actual women are the best."
Howard,"No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection."
Howard,"There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too."
Howard,Seen it.
Howard,"Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled."
Howard,"Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
Howard,"Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
Howard,Good job not making fun of her.
Howard,Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.
Howard,"Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?"
Howard,What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
Howard,Sorry.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
Howard,"Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?"
Howard,Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
Howard,"All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon."
Howard,"Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
Howard,Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
Howard,"Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you."
Howard,Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
Howard,I respect that.  
Howard,Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
Howard,"Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys."
Howard,"A little jealous, are we?"
Howard,It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo.
Howard,"Sure, no mobsters there."
Howard,"All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
Howard,"Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
Howard,I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
Howard,"I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good."
Howard,"Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
Howard,"Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you."
Howard,"Hey, look who’s back!"
Howard,How long has he been stuck?
Howard,Have you tried rebooting him?
Howard,"Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating."
Howard,What could be better? We’re in.
Howard,You can come with us.
Howard,"Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?"
Howard,I thought I smelled popcorn.
Howard,Want my corn?
Howard,Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.
Howard,"Not this time, I promise."
Howard,"Thanks. You, too."
Howard,Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
Howard,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
Howard,"I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van."
Howard,Happy now?
Howard,That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
Howard,"Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk."
Howard,"Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
Howard,"I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food."
Howard,I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
Howard,That’s the one.
Howard,"Oh, man!"
Howard,I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
Howard,"So, what did you end up doing?"
Howard,I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.
Howard,Absolutely. And I’d leave him there. 
Howard,"Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried."
Howard,"Ooh, that’s gotta sting."
Howard,"Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples."
Howard,I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.
Howard,That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
Howard,"Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut."
Howard,Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
Howard,"Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
Howard,But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?
Howard,You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
Howard,"Sheldon, this is a summons."
Howard,Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
Howard,You are guilty.  That one I liked.
Howard,"Okay, he’s going to jail."
Howard,"Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie’s Choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. No."
Howard,"Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off."
Howard,"Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Howard,That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
Howard,"Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee."
Howard,"You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato."
Howard,He said we could call him Stan.
Howard,Not just the finger. The moving finger.
Howard,Would you just let it go?
Howard,Sweet.
Howard,"My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one."
Howard,They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
Howard,"Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?"
Howard,Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
Howard,You see what you’re doing? Stop that.
Howard,One Ring to bring them all.
Howard,"So, I was doing some checking on the ring."
Howard,"Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
Howard,"You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
Howard,Just a guy. I know a guy.
Howard,"No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking."
Howard,"I know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
Howard,"Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal."
Howard,"No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring."
Howard,"Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…"
Howard,"Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
Howard,Why do you want a jet ski?
Howard,It’s sad how great that sounds.
Howard,Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
Howard,"Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah."
Howard,"If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat."
Howard,"So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
Howard,You brought a lawyer?
Howard,"Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
Howard,Then let go!
Howard,I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
Howard,You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. 
Howard,"You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
Howard,"I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office."
Howard,Will you be quiet?
Howard,I’ll call you back.
Howard,Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
Howard,That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
Howard,Then let go of the ring and walk away.
Howard,All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
Howard,We’re getting to him.
Howard,What are you doing?
Howard,"No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too."
Howard,We stand up.
Howard,Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
Howard,You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,What’s your point?
Howard,"Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
Howard,Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
Howard,"Uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
Howard,"Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can’t do is shut up."
Howard,Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
Howard,Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
Howard,"Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap."
Howard,"My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy."
Howard,"Oh, that’s not a good name."
Howard,"Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
Howard,What’s with him?
Howard,Are you saying he’s man-struating?
Howard,"Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?"
Howard,"Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
Howard,Would that be a giant rat’s ass?
Howard,"Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible."
Howard,"Oh, but something happened."
Howard,"What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
Howard,Did you ask her to start waxing?
Howard,"While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?"
Howard,That wasn’t a no.
Howard,Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.
Howard,I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
Howard,Then what’s with the disinfectant?
Howard,"Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan."
Howard,"I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?"
Howard,I guessed premature. Does that count?
Howard,"You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers."
Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
Howard,What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.
Howard,"So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny."
Howard,What?
Howard,"Oh, God, this is good."
Howard,Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.
Howard,"Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World."
Howard,I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
Howard,"Yeah, since when do you take walks?"
Howard,Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.
Howard,Or we could go together.
Howard,Let’s go.
Howard,Okay.
Howard,You said you were going for a walk.
Howard,"So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
Howard,Which way are you going?
Howard,I parked my scooter down the block.
Howard,"Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?"
Howard,I definitely smell raw hot dog.
Howard,"All right, have a nice walk."
Howard,You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
Howard,"Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about."
Howard,"Sheldon, come on."
Howard,"See you, buddy."
Howard,Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
Howard,"Yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
Howard,"Yeah, um, I have a two-part question."
Howard,"A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
Howard,So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down."
Howard,What the hell are you doing?
Howard,"If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills."
Howard,She doesn’t know she takes them.
Howard,Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
Howard,"‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
Howard,How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
Howard,Hi.
Howard,What do you mean what? It’s Halo night.
Howard,"That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup."
Howard,Who’s that
Howard,"Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?"
Howard,"Uh, yeah."
Howard,"Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master."
Howard,Beg pardon?
Howard,What the frak?
Howard,We broke up weeks ago.
Howard,I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
Howard,He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
Howard,Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
Howard,I’m out.
Howard,"That’s a bazinga, right?"
Howard,"You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows."
Howard,She dumped you?
Howard,"Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
Howard,"If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now."
Howard,Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.
Howard,Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
Howard,There it is. There’s the spike!
Howard,Horse.
Howard,"The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
Howard,"No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found."
Howard,You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
Howard,"Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
Howard,"Yeah, right."
Howard,He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
Howard,What?
Howard,Excuse me?
Howard,You’re kidding. An actual woman?
Howard,"Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
Howard,"I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon."
Howard,Nope. Why don’t you ask him?
Howard,"Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…"
Howard,Not us. Him.
Howard,"Well, him about to find out about her."
Howard,Sheldon. Hey.
Howard,"Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
Howard,Four thirty.
Howard,What?
Howard,"Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
Howard,"And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”"
Howard,"Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
Howard,"Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later."
Howard,"All right, you can have a hot chocolate."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Okay, I’m out."
Howard,"Good God, what have we done?"
Howard,And now the kung pao chicken.
Howard,"And finally, my moo shu pork."
Howard,"Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station."
Howard,Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
Howard,Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
Howard,Coming up. 
Howard,Just wait.
Howard,"Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand."
Howard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Howard,"No, not peace. Hang on."
Howard,You kidding? They still think it’s in a secure locker at JPL.
Howard,Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
Howard,"Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler."
Howard,"Or, as we call them, Shamy."
Howard,I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
Howard,"Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that’s the spot. Oh, baby."
Howard,"I’ll eat later. I’m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"Yes. Now, help me!"
Howard,"Not funny, Leonard."
Howard,"Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
Howard,"No, no! Don’t touch, the program is paused."
Howard,"No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting."
Howard,What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
Howard,"Okay, I can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches."
Howard,I…
Howard,"That’s great, Mom, thanks!"
Howard,Don’t come up here!
Howard,"Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here."
Howard,Don’t tug. No tugging.
Howard,I slipped and fell.
Howard,It’s a robot arm.
Howard,I only built the arm.
Howard,Can you please just help me?
Howard,You think you could be a little more discreet?
Howard,But it’s frozen.
Howard,"No, you see, it’s more complicated than that.  Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree."
Howard,What do we owe you?
Howard,Here you go.
Howard,"He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life."
Howard,Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?
Howard,"Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars."
Howard,I know!  Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
Howard,"Thank you, sir."
Howard,He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
Howard,"Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag."
Howard,I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
Howard,Is that Steve Wozniak?
Howard,"On the potty? What are you, five?"
Howard,Toilet.
Howard,"Oh, and potty is okay?"
Howard,"What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?"
Howard,Nice to see you.
Howard,"Ah, ah."
Howard,"Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?"
Howard,"Um, tell us about your work, Amy."
Howard,"Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?"
Howard,Philadelphia.
Howard,"Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?"
Howard,"Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it."
Howard,You’re not doing that right.
Howard,Gimme.
Howard,Trust me.
Howard,I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
Howard,"And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them."
Howard,The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. 
Howard,"Yeah, we all thought so."
Howard,What?
Howard,More like Yoko and Yoko.
Howard,"Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses."
Howard,We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.
Howard,"Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."
Howard,You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
Howard,I thought we discussed the P-word.
Howard,Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
Howard,Hello.
Howard,"Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon."
Howard,"Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? ."
Howard,"So, my dear, we meet again."
Howard,"I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff."
Howard,Anything.
Howard,"Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart."
Howard,"Okay, if you insist."
Howard,"No, Ma!"
Howard,"Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?"
Howard,Bernadette? What are you doing here?
Howard,"No, I’m not."
Howard,"Okay, I’m a little confused here."
Howard,Not that kind of confused.
Howard,"No, of course not."
Howard,"Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?"
Howard,"Great, Ma!"
Howard,"And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening."
Howard,I did a stupid thing.
Howard,It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
Howard,No. Stop asking.
Howard,In a nutshell.
Howard,"Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not."
Howard,"Okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
Howard,Why?
Howard,Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
Howard,I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
Howard,She does?
Howard,"She saw that, huh?"
Howard,Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
Howard,"Oh, I’d rather not say."
Howard,But it’s embarrassing.
Howard,"Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?"
Howard,"Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
Howard,Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
Howard,Would you talk to her?
Howard,"Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story."
Howard,"Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey."
Howard,"Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?"
Howard,"No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11."
Howard,"You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted."
Howard,"I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?"
Howard,"Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean."
Howard,"You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?"
Howard,"Not for me, thanks."
Howard,Maybe later.
Howard,"So, are you seeing anybody?"
Howard,"Penny, can we have a little privacy?"
Howard,"Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…"
Howard,"Well, not real girls."
Howard,Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
Howard,"Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?"
Howard,"Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…"
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"What do you mean, whose fault was that?"
Howard,I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
Howard,Really?
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Howard,"Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again."
Howard,Did Penny tell you about that?
Howard,The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
Howard,How’d he know about it?
Howard,Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
Howard,"Short jokes? Really? You’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me."
Howard,I had a good time.
Howard,"You said, well, the move, remember?"
Howard,"No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that."
Howard,What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
Howard,"I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?"
Howard,"So, how’d it go?"
Howard,"Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that."
Howard,You that desperate?
Howard,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
Howard,Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
Howard,I think she likes you.
Howard,"Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you."
Howard,"Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten."
Howard,Not that I’ve ever seen.
Howard,Gagh!
Howard,This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
Howard,"Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now."
Howard,Let’s just agree they’re both hot.
Howard,"Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"So, you got any special plans with your sister?"
Howard,I have a girlfriend now.
Howard,"Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? . "
Howard,Didn’t see it? What were you doing?
Howard,"Really, you, and where, where did you go?"
Howard,How could you? We had a pact!
Howard,"Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you."
Howard,Mmm.
Howard,"Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker."
Howard,"And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food."
Howard,"Thankyou, and I’m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July."
Howard,Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
Howard,"Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI."
Howard,They’re just doing a background check on me.
Howard,"Hey, buddies. Guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?"
Howard,"Apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. You guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?"
Howard,"I see. Well, it’s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything."
Howard,You?
Howard,And they were okay with that?
Howard,"Are you kidding me? You’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I’m sorry?"
Howard,Your apology is not accepted.
Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
Howard,Not really.
Howard,"Oh. Go away, Sheldon."
Howard,"Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts."
Howard,You’re giving me a couch cushion?
Howard,But you love that spot.
Howard,All right. Apology accepted.
Howard,"I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…"
Howard,Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.
Howard,"Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial."
Howard,"Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
Howard,"You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives."
Howard,"Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you."
Howard,Who’s there?
Howard,"Olive you, too."
Howard,Knock-knock.
Howard,I have a girlfriend and you don’t.
Howard,So. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us to Raiders?
Howard,Ooh. Can’t wait for that to start.
Howard,"Oh, shut up."
Howard,Too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
Howard,"Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
Howard,I guess that’s that. Let’s go home.
Howard,I guess we’d better go after him.
Howard,"Where did he go?  We’re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke."
Howard,"Come on, Short Round."
Howard,Let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
Howard,"You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?"
Howard,How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
Howard,That’s a stupid question.
Howard,"Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race."
Howard,"Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist."
Howard,Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
Howard,Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
Howard,"Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits."
Howard,C-7.
Howard,"How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7."
Howard,What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
Howard,"Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her."
Howard,"It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it."
Howard,"I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear."
Howard,What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
Howard,"Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption."
Howard,"Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did."
Howard,"Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
Howard,Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
Howard,What?
Howard,"Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way."
Howard,"Okay, I think that’s enough about me."
Howard,It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
Howard,We’d come visit you.
Howard,Hold on. He could come back.
Howard,Nope. He’s gone.
Howard,What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
Howard,No!
Howard,Hey.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,Whoa. Where did that come from?
Howard,Way to go shutting up.
Howard,Fine.
Howard,Uh-uh.
Howard,"Yeah, I get it now."
Howard,Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
Howard,They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
Howard,"No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?"
Howard,Mouse Boy?
Howard,"First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick."
Howard,"Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?"
Howard,There you are.
Howard,Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
Howard,"No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of."
Howard,Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
Howard,"A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
Howard,Perhaps. Are you scared?
Howard,"Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
Howard,"Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick."
Howard,How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
Howard,"Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!"
Howard,You got a better idea?
Howard,Ding!
Howard,It’s a bell.
Howard,Fine. How do you want to start?
Howard,One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.
Howard,"That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside."
Howard,"Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?"
Howard,"All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle."
Howard,We’re starting now!
Howard,I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!"
Howard,"If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you."
Howard,I prefer to think that I can’t lose.
Howard,"You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?"
Howard,You narcissistic nincompoop!
Howard,Ice Dragon.
Howard,"Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"
Howard,"No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
Howard,So go apologize.
Howard,"You started it, we just piled on."
Howard,Leonard’s buying.
Howard,"Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system."
Howard,Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
Howard,He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
Howard,"Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?"
Howard,She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
Howard,I’m Batman.
Howard,I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
Howard,"Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow."
Howard,"Well, actually."
Howard,"Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman."
Howard,"No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny."
Howard,"You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing."
Howard,Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
Howard,Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.
Howard,"Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn’t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!"
Howard,A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.
Howard,I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
Howard,What’s that? Some weird sex thing?
Howard,Sounds like we’re in business.
Howard,"Sheldon, I don’t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…"
Howard,"Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going."
Howard,"Hey, I…"
Howard,"There’s your answer, free food."
Howard,Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
Howard,"So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…"
Howard,"Like I was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
Howard,"Again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
Howard,"It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home."
Howard,Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?
Howard,We’re not quitting on Leonard.
Howard,"Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function."
Howard,Eureka!
Howard,Fine. Let’s say it together.
Howard,No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
Howard,"Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop."
Howard,We’re going to be hundred-aires.
Howard,We have.
Howard,Still right behind you.
Howard,Really? You want to see the keynote?
Howard,"Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap."
Howard,"We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel."
Howard,"No, see, it’s not…"
Howard,What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.
Howard,Yeah. It’s the Love Car.
Howard,Hi. Ow. Hi.
Howard,Yes. Bernie sure is.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie?"
Howard,Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
Howard,Oh! That’s a relief.
Howard,"That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year."
Howard,"No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?"
Howard,Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
Howard,No. It’s just…
Howard,"I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact."
Howard,"Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?"
Howard,Yep. Loser.
Howard,Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
Howard,I’m… I…
Howard,"No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite."
Howard,"Yeah, let’s go with that."
Howard,"Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry."
Howard,"Let me ask you something, Bernie."
Howard,How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
Howard,"What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?"
Howard,"Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
Howard,"Apparently, if you’re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
Howard,"Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2."
Howard,"So, how’d the lecture go?"
Howard,"Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would."
Howard,"FYI, I think that’s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star."
Howard,Sheldon still moping?
Howard,"Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon."
Howard,Labradoodle?
Howard,"Raj, I have amazing news!"
Howard,I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
Howard,"I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years."
Howard,"That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs."
Howard,Sexual needs.
Howard,"So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her."
Howard,"Raj, is that you?"
Howard,"Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it."
Howard,"Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette."
Howard,Sexually.
Howard,You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
Howard,You’re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
Howard,Why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
Howard,I’m in!
Howard,"Okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
Howard,"Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. My mother does."
Howard,What about Sheldon?
Howard,"Hey, put your tie back in your pants."
Howard,You’re kidding.
Howard,I’m an engineer. Most engineers don’t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
Howard,I’m gonna go hit the bar.
Howard,"It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond."
Howard,Hey. How was dinner?
Howard,What’s going on?
Howard,Yes!
Howard,Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
Howard,You lucky duck.
Howard,How was she?
Howard,What’s so funny?
Howard,"I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?"
Howard,You know it’s meant as a compliment.
Howard,This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
Howard,"Well, gotta go."
Howard,"Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning."
Howard,"It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job."
Howard,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?"
Howard,"Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?"
Howard,Your call.
Howard,"Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?"
Howard,I’ve got a better solution.
Howard,"We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom."
Howard,Look at us planning a future together.
Howard,"Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma."
Howard,I was out with Bernadette.
Howard,"I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!"
Howard,Nobody has a disease!
Howard,That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
Howard,I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
Howard,I need a place to crash.
Howard,Big fight with my mother.
Howard,"No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette."
Howard,Tea does sound nice.
Howard,There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.
Howard,"Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…"
Howard,"I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette."
Howard,That’s not really necessary.
Howard,Thanks.
Howard,"That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?"
Howard,"Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier."
Howard,Isn’t that great?
Howard,"Oh, uh…"
Howard,"No, wait. You didn’t let me finish."
Howard,Uh…
Howard,I choose you.
Howard,Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.
Howard,I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.
Howard,"I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?"
Howard,That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
Howard,"Wow, indeed."
Howard,Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
Howard,A little snack. You got any string cheese?
Howard,Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
Howard,You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
Howard,"Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus."
Howard,"Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist."
Howard,You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.
Howard,It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.
Howard,"What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat."
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?"
Howard,"Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma."
Howard,Didn’t you read my email?
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?"
Howard,"Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
Howard,"Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?"
Howard,Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,I think it’s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
Howard,"Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?"
Howard,"Here, shuffle these."
Howard,"Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it."
Howard,"Now remember your card, put it back in the deck."
Howard,"Remind me, what’s your birthday?"
Howard,"Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card."
Howard,Is that your card?
Howard,A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
Howard,"You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?"
Howard,"That’s your card, right?"
Howard,"Oh, really? So how did I do it?"
Howard,I thought you had more important things to think about.
Howard,So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
Howard,"Yeah, I was talking to Raj."
Howard,Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.
Howard,"I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle."
Howard,And was your card the jack of diamonds?
Howard,"You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!"
Howard,You’re right.
Howard,Really?
Howard,"I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?"
Howard,Okay.
Howard,What’s with the wand and the beep?
Howard,"That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it."
Howard,Three of clubs. 
Howard,Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
Howard,Maybe. When it stops being fun.
Howard,Incoming.
Howard,Hey!
Howard,"Oh, that’s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?"
Howard,Want me to tell you how to do it?
Howard,I’ll show you one more time. Raj?
Howard,All right. . Two of hearts.
Howard,"Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize."
Howard,"Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint."
Howard,Whoa! Somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
Howard,"All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
Howard,Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
Howard,"Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy."
Howard,Our troll just walked in! I got him!
Howard,"So, how do you guys want to play this?"
Howard,"Nah, I think we have to be more subtle."
Howard,"Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker."
Howard,"Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman."
Howard,"Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California."
Howard,"Well, quite a bit, actually."
Howard,"Yes, he does live with his parents. Here’s a Google Earth shot of their house."
Howard,"Also, tonight’s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and"
Howard,And me.
Howard,"I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V."
Howard,"Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant."
Howard,That’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
Howard,"New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D’s, three O’s."
Howard,"I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat."
Howard,"Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?"
Howard,Beyonce? Really?
Howard,"Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train."
Howard,Why did you bring that?
Howard,"Yeah, he walked right into our trap."
Howard,19th-century technology.
Howard,"No, not a clue."
Howard,"This one’s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn’t make it work with her?"
Howard,"Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else."
Howard,It’s a Bernadette thing.
Howard,I’m gonna ask her to marry me.
Howard,Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends."
Howard,Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
Howard,"I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…"
Howard,"Yes, what?"
Howard,You will?
Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
Howard,"That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?"
Howard,Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Howard,I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.
Howard,"Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?"
Howard,Most of those guys live in Texas.
Howard,Okay.
Howard,Fine.
Howard,"I’m not grilling you, I was just curious."
Howard,"It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?"
Howard,Sure.
Howard,Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
Howard,"Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?"
Howard,"Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop"
Howard,He drank from Leonard’s glass.
Howard,Where are you going?
Howard,Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
Howard,I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
Howard,"Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?"
Howard,"Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons."
Howard,Troll master.
Howard,Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
Howard,"Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl."
Howard,You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
Howard,"Ma, I’m home! Where are you?"
Howard,"So, how’d it go?"
Howard,"No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette."
Howard,"Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?"
Howard,"No, she never mentioned it."
Howard,"Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?"
Howard,"That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news."
Howard,"Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Son of a bitch! Ma, help!"
Howard,"So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
Howard,"No, I did what any son would do."
Howard,I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
Howard,"What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable."
Howard,They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
Howard,My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .
Howard,"Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
Howard,It’s not important.
Howard,You’d think that. But no.
Howard,You can’t take that personally.
Howard,"What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t."
Howard,"Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
Howard,"Bernie, wait!"
Howard,"Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways."
Howard,"It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you."
Howard,What’s wrong with the bathroom here?
Howard,"Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home."
Howard,No!
Howard,Is she okay?
Howard,Can I see her?
Howard,Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.
Howard,"Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns."
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
Howard,Yeah. Do you?
Howard,And are you?
Howard,"Well, based on the available evid…"
Howard,Where are you going?
Howard,"Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?"
Howard,Colossal Serpent.
Howard,"If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely."
Howard,Uh..
Howard,"You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty."
Howard,"Congratulations, honey."
Howard,"Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you."
Howard,What?
Howard,Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
Howard,"Hey, what’s up?"
Howard,"No, Ma! It’s Raj!"
Howard,Yes!
Howard,"Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!"
Howard,What’s up?
Howard,"Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother."
Howard,"Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!"
Howard,"I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career."
Howard,So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
Howard,"Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to."
Howard,You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
Howard,I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
Howard,She gave me a beautiful watch.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Yeah, how could you do that?"
Howard,I got his back.
Howard,"Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me."
Howard,You’re not in love with Penny.
Howard,Who?
Howard,I’m sorry. What?
Howard,I don’t see anything.
Howard,Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
Howard,Fine with me.
Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home."
Howard,Damn those sons of bitches!
Howard,What are you going to do in Nebraska?
Howard,"Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand."
Howard,Hang on.
Howard,Hand me the tuna melt.
Howard,Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
Howard,"When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
Howard,"You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
Howard,"Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
Howard,"Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
Howard,"Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books."
Howard,"Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong."
Howard,"Just his head, right?"
Howard,"What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try."
Howard,"Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
Howard,Close. Really French it.
Howard,"Yeah, you got it, you got it."
Howard,Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
Howard,Why do you have to make everything weird?
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Howard,Check it out. Free chair.
Howard,On three?
Howard,"All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go.  Yeah, well, now it means her."
Howard,"Fine. But next time, we get a sitter."
Howard,Neither of them are close.
Howard,Which side do you come down on?
Howard,Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
Howard,"First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
Howard,"Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house."
Howard,Why would she move out? It’s her house.
Howard,"Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
Howard,"Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
Howard,Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
Howard,Movie theatre.
Howard,"I got it! Oh, hi."
Howard,"Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first."
Howard,"The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like."
Howard,"Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?"
Howard,See? She’s good with it.
Howard,"So, dinner went nice."
Howard,"Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?"
Howard,"Relax, it’ll be fine."
Howard,Ready for bed?
Howard,"Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!"
Howard,"Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
Howard,Problem solved.
Howard,"Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time."
Howard,"And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love."
Howard,"Morning, Mom."
Howard,"Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning."
Howard,"Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?"
Howard,Is there any butter?
Howard,Oh.
Howard,I don’t need any butter.
Howard,"Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself."
Howard,"I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”"
Howard,Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.
Howard,You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
Howard,"Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?"
Howard,"Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
Howard,With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
Howard,"So, what’s for dinner?"
Howard,"Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats."
Howard,She says it’s nice to meet you.
Howard,"Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
Howard,He’ll text you.
Howard,Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
Howard,"No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late."
Howard,Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?
Howard,"Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent."
Howard,I don’t know how to spell it.
Howard,He likes your eyes.
Howard,"She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”"
Howard,No.
Howard,She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
Howard,You really want to ask her that?
Howard,"She says, do you play an instrument?"
Howard,Do you hear yourself
Howard,Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.
Howard,"It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling."
Howard,"The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!"
Howard,"Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime."
Howard,"I speak sign language, I don’t read minds."
Howard,"Yeah, but I’m a make out king. "
Howard,You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
Howard,"It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
Howard,Okay.
Howard,Why are you still doing this?
Howard,Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
Howard,"What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
Howard,And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
Howard,"He’s not going to listen, he’s in love."
Howard,"Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go."
Howard,Wow.
Howard,"Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage."
Howard,Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
Howard,"She says, sure, what about him?"
Howard,"Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now."
Howard,Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
Howard,"Thanks for dinner, buddy."
Howard,"It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
Howard,Who’s Mohammed Lee?
Howard,"It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut."
Howard,"Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
Howard,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl."
Howard,You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?
Howard,"I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift."
Howard,"All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?"
Howard,"Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
Howard,This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
Howard,Honestly? Sex.
Howard,Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
Howard,"I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it."
Howard,I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
Howard,"Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?"
Howard,No?
Howard,Well why not?
Howard,"Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again."
Howard,"Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it."
Howard,Really?
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"I love you, too. So, sex now?"
Howard,What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
Howard,Little bit.
Howard,"I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
Howard,Obviously.
Howard,Tell her I’m not home!
Howard,You can. I have nothing to say.
Howard,"I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
Howard,"If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
Howard,"Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
Howard,"Well, those big kids were rocking it."
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Right, right."
Howard,"So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station."
Howard,"Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist."
Howard,"Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still."
Howard,What do you say?
Howard,"Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him."
Howard,"Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames."
Howard,He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
Howard,"No, you only get one wish."
Howard,"Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon."
Howard,We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
Howard,Who had money on faints?
Howard,Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
Howard,"Hey, Sheldon."
Howard,"That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette."
Howard,What’s up?
Howard,"Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?"
Howard,Whatever. 
Howard,"Trick or treat, bubbeleh."
Howard,"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?"
Howard,That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
Howard,"Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
Howard,Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,I guess.
Howard,Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? 
Howard,What?
Howard,What do you want us to do about it?
Howard,"So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset."
Howard,"Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking."
Howard,"Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it."
Howard,I’m pushing play.
Howard,"If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again."
Howard,I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
Howard,It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
Howard,"Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay."
Howard,"A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid."
Howard,Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
Howard,"What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?"
Howard,You interested in Amy?
Howard,"Mmm, make it two."
Howard,"We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous."
Howard,Very.
Howard,Very.
Howard,Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
Howard,Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
Howard,You are.
Howard,"Ooh, a sheriff’s badge."
Howard,I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri."
Howard,"Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
Howard,"Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy."
Howard,You wore underwear? You fool.
Howard,"That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?"
Howard,Like the Black Death and Europe.
Howard,How exactly would these glasses work?
Howard,"How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
Howard,Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?
Howard,"Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?"
Howard,"As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. "
Howard,How is this lying?
Howard,Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
Howard,How is that not amusing?
Howard,"Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da."
Howard,Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
Howard,"Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
Howard,"Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
Howard,I just gave it to her!
Howard,"She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!"
Howard,You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
Howard,"Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
Howard,"Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there."
Howard,"And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear."
Howard,"Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
Howard,"Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
Howard,"Okay, we’re going to stick this in here  and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants."
Howard,"She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake."
Howard,Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
Howard,"Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,"All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine."
Howard,"Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?"
Howard,"Well, yeah."
Howard,I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.
Howard,"Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual."
Howard,"I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers."
Howard,Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.
Howard,"I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
Howard,"Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden."
Howard,You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
Howard,"I don’t know, hunting?"
Howard,"Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
Howard,"I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes."
Howard,Really? That’s great. What?
Howard,Me?
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Yeah, we’re good."
Howard,"I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom."
Howard,"Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
Howard,No.
Howard,Why?
Howard,Why?
Howard,I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
Howard,Why not?
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you."
Howard,Let’s see the new phone.
Howard,"Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part."
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Howard,"Oh, let me try the voice recognition."
Howard,Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
Howard,She is gonna break his heart.
Howard,Great.
Howard,"Yeah, what are we eating?"
Howard,Yes. His phone.
Howard,Uh-huh.
Howard,"Check it out, press release from NASA."
Howard,This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
Howard,I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
Howard,Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
Howard,"Emergency drill night last night, huh?"
Howard,I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
Howard,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
Howard,"Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid."
Howard,You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
Howard,"No, that’s not what I’m talking about."
Howard,No.
Howard,"Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash."
Howard,"Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts."
Howard,Like how?
Howard,Did it work?
Howard,That’s actually not a terrible plan.
Howard,"All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song."
Howard,"Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!"
Howard,"Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning."
Howard,"No problem, Dr. Massimino."
Howard,Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
Howard,Sorry. My phone.
Howard,"Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man."
Howard,Not now!
Howard,My mom. Sorry.
Howard,"No problem, Fruit Loops."
Howard,E.
Howard,I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
Howard,I wonder what he wants.
Howard,No. You should go.
Howard,"How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
Howard,I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
Howard,I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
Howard,Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
Howard,Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?
Howard,Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
Howard,"I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care."
Howard,A pre-nup? Wow.
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,"You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable."
Howard,"Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too."
Howard,I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,What happened to your thumb?
Howard,"We’re grown men, we drink at bars."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sure."
Howard,I’m not signing a pre-nup.
Howard,"No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
Howard,You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
Howard,"Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
Howard,Done.
Howard,Okay.
Howard,"Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?"
Howard,"You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May."
Howard,They’ve got a phone.
Howard,"I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down."
Howard,I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.
Howard,So sad.
Howard,It’s numbered.
Howard,"Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you."
Howard,It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.
Howard,Sheldon was higher.
Howard,Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
Howard,The bird?
Howard,The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
Howard,"Lookie here, I got my travel orders."
Howard,"Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred."
Howard,You read it as oh eight hundred.
Howard,"You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy."
Howard,"Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going"
Howard,I miss you.
Howard,"Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity."
Howard,"It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
Howard,"Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
Howard,"No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
Howard,"I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light."
Howard,"We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
Howard,"Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer."
Howard,"No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
Howard,"But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
Howard,"I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry."
Howard,"No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste."
Howard,"Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
Howard,No. Wait. Send more underwear.
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
Howard,"Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo."
Howard,You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
Howard,Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
Howard,They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
Howard,48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
Howard,"Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
Howard,"Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller."
Howard,"Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. "
Howard,"Hey, guys, I got a surprise."
Howard,"No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah."
Howard,"I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now."
Howard,But I worked hard to get this armour.
Howard,"Fine, I’ll change.  "
Howard,I’ll miss you.
Howard,I’ll miss you more.
Howard,"That’s my ride, got to go. "
Howard,"Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding."
Howard,"Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine."
Howard,"Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
Howard,"Come on, who is it?"
Howard,"No, uh, I don’t think so."
Howard,Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
Howard,Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
Howard,Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
Howard,Nice to meet you.
Howard,"Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer."
Howard,Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
Howard,"What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?"
Howard,Then why did she even go out with you?
Howard,"Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy."
Howard,"Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s."
Howard,"Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you."
Howard,So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
Howard,"Yes, to other gay people."
Howard,I told everybody.
Howard,"Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
Howard,Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
Howard,"So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning."
Howard,"Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking."
Howard,"He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
Howard,I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
Howard,"Hm, it’s no big deal."
Howard,"Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics."
Howard,Yep.
Howard,Not on your life.
Howard,"I told you, no."
Howard,"No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?"
Howard,"Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?"
Howard,Jews don’t have heaven.
Howard,Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
Howard,"Oh, you can’t be serious."
Howard,Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
Howard,Get out of my lab.
Howard,Get out.
Howard,Out!
Howard,It was great. We talked about movies.
Howard,I showed him some card tricks.
Howard,He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
Howard,"Something got you down there, bunky?"
Howard,You’re kidding.
Howard,"You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111."
Howard,No!
Howard,"Let me try gansta, hells no."
Howard,That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
Howard,You walk away.
Howard,I do.
Howard,"Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him."
Howard,"Sheldon, come on back."
Howard,I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
Howard,"But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me."
Howard,Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
Howard,You should be so lucky.
Howard,"Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
Howard,That’s nice.
Howard,"Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back."
Howard,"Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
Howard,"Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?"
Howard,Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
Howard,"Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong."
Howard,"No, no, no, mon petit cherie."
Howard,What’s the matter?
Howard,"It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume."
Howard,"Hey, I gave you first crack at it."
Howard,He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
Howard,"Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
Howard,"Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop."
Howard,"Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs."
Howard,"Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?"
Howard,"Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
Howard,I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one."
Howard,Give me a compliment.
Howard,"No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do."
Howard,"Well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Howard,"Sorry, I can’t."
Howard,I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
Howard,"Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball."
Howard,"Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers."
Howard,"What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more."
Howard,"Well, it’s probably not for me."
Howard,"Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight."
Howard,She was my second cousin.
Howard,"Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down."
Howard,Don’t remember. Please sit down.
Howard,"Oh, please shut up."
Howard,"Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
Howard,"Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes."
Howard,"How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
Howard,"Bernadette, listen…"
Howard,"Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country."
Howard,"Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back."
Howard,"It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you."
Howard,What is this?
Howard,"No, but what is it?"
Howard,I don’t know what my next move is.
Howard,Yeah?
Howard,I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.
Howard,I need to talk to Bernadette.
Howard,"All right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
Howard,"Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
Howard,Penny has a message for you.
Howard,Do you want me to go?
Howard,I get that.
Howard,"Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later."
Howard,"So, is the wedding still on?"
Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,"Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
Howard,"Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,"Well, their technology isn’t that bad."
Howard,"All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried."
Howard,Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
Howard,"Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did."
Howard,"Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?"
Howard,"No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
Howard,"Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon."
Howard,It looks like I’m going into space after all.
Howard,"Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay."
Howard,"Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch."
Howard,A week from Friday.
Howard,"You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back."
Howard,"Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you."
Howard,But what about all the plans and the guests?
Howard,"You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried."
Howard,"No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man."
Howard,We can only hope… that he doesn’t.
Howard,"Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?"
Howard,"Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person."
Howard,I’m not sure.
Howard,"How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something."
Howard,"No, thank you. I’m allergic."
Howard,From nuts?
Howard,"Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station."
Howard,"So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you."
Howard,I’m sorry. May I be excused?
Howard,"I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit."
Howard,"I’m aware of that, sir."
Howard,Uh-huh.
Howard,"Right, right."
Howard,"Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt."
Howard,But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
Howard,"Um, okay."
Howard,"All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?"
Howard,You really think so?
Howard,Hey Mike?
Howard,I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.
Howard,"Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch."
Howard,"Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?"
Howard,Check.
Howard,"No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops."
Howard,"Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch."
Howard,"Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again."
Howard,Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.
Howard,"No, here."
Howard,"Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space."
Howard,"Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything."
Howard,"Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand."
Howard,"No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
Howard,What?
Howard,But I’m leaving in two days.
Howard,I don’t need to take cereal.
Howard,They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.
Howard,Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.
Howard,"I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us."
Howard,You proposed to Penny?
Howard,Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
Howard,"I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette."
Howard,"I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station."
Howard,"Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?"
Howard,Thanks.
Howard,"You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married."
Howard,I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
Howard,"Oh, wait to go, Raj."
Howard,"Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us."
Howard,That’s great.
Howard,"So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony."
Howard,Leaking? What’s leaking?
Howard,There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
Howard,What happens on the tenth time?
Howard,"Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present."
Howard,"Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married."
Howard,What?
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,It’s the groom.
Howard,"Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back."
Howard,She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
Howard,"Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that."
Howard,"Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
Howard,You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
Howard,Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
Howard,"Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you."
Howard,I have strongly mixed feelings.
Howard,"I can hear you without the phone,"
Howard,"I’m excited to talk to you, too."
Howard,How about calling her my wife?
Howard,They do. That’s why we marry them.
Howard,"Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call."
Howard,"Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined."
Howard,"Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?"
Howard,"I’m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable."
Howard,"Oh, yeah? That’s nice."
Howard,"Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?"
Howard,"Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better."
Howard,Pretty clear.
Howard,"I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality."
Howard,Who is it?
Howard,"Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer."
Howard,You can’t catch a computer virus.
Howard,"What do you want, Ma?"
Howard,"Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…"
Howard,Ma…
Howard,It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.
Howard,"Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around."
Howard,"Okay, okay."
Howard,"Now, can we please change the subject?"
Howard,"Hey, I’m a grown man. I’m gonna live with my wife. My mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own."
Howard,Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.
Howard,"I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I’ll talk to you tomorrow?"
Howard,"To infinity and beyond, baby."
Howard,I know.
Howard,"Oh, I’m never going back."
Howard,"You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am."
Howard,It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.
Howard,Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.
Howard,"Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings."
Howard,"Yes, I read you, Sheldon."
Howard,"You’re out of your mind,Sheldon."
Howard,"All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower."
Howard,Bye.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie."
Howard,"Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old."
Howard,Nothing. Everything’s fine.
Howard,The other astronauts are being mean to me.
Howard,"Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes."
Howard,You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
Howard,What am I supposed to say?
Howard,"Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie."
Howard,No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night’s sleep. "
Howard,What’s wrong? You look upset.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie."
Howard,"Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me."
Howard,I know.
Howard,"Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?"
Howard,"Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?"
Howard,"Oh, baby, you’re killing me."
Howard,"Uh, no, not really."
Howard,"Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?"
Howard,"It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties."
Howard,"I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums."
Howard,"Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man."
Howard,"Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place."
Howard,"Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked."
Howard,"No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home."
Howard,"Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky."
Howard,Whee! Whee!
Howard,The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!
Howard,"Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth."
Howard,"I missed you, too. Where are the guys?"
Howard,"Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised. "
Howard,Gesundheit. You okay?
Howard,"Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting."
Howard,"Bernie, you okay?"
Howard,Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
Howard,Okay.
Howard,Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…
Howard,"Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now."
Howard,You okay?
Howard,Okay.
Howard,Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
Howard,"Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door."
Howard,"Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it."
Howard,All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?
Howard,"Ma, who is in there?"
Howard,Who is that?
Howard,"If you’re busy, I can come back."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,You’re a dentist.
Howard,One to beam aboard?
Howard,"Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back."
Howard,"Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist."
Howard,Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
Howard,"It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels."
Howard,"Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?"
Howard,"Wow, so you guys are like buds now?"
Howard,"Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?"
Howard,"Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool."
Howard,So I’d be sitting by myself?
Howard,"No, no, you guys go. Have fun."
Howard,"Absolutely. See you, Stuart."
Howard,At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
Howard,"Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space."
Howard,I don’t think so.
Howard,"Yes. Yes, I am."
Howard,"Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…"
Howard,"Yes, please.  Perfect."
Howard,"Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space."
Howard,It’s my official NASA portrait.
Howard,That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
Howard,"But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn channel."
Howard,"Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view."
Howard,Not really.
Howard,"You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back."
Howard,Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.
Howard,"That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"
Howard,You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.
Howard,"Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?"
Howard,"So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?"
Howard,What?
Howard,I don’t talk about it every minute.
Howard,What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
Howard,"So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?"
Howard,"Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again."
Howard,"I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can’t even point?"
Howard,I don’t care. Get the Tardis.
Howard,"Yeah, sure, whatever."
Howard,Clever.
Howard,Nothing.
Howard,"Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?"
Howard,"You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again."
Howard,Fine.
Howard,"To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood."
Howard,"Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe you should go without me."
Howard,I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.
Howard,Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
Howard,Who cares?
Howard,"You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old."
Howard,"Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!"
Howard,"Great, now I’m in trouble. You happy?"
Howard,"No, I’m not. They’re all being rude. And you’re being rude."
Howard,You’re my wife. You’re supposed to be on my side.
Howard,"Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I’m just…"
Howard,Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
Howard,You’re just saying that.
Howard,I love you.
Howard,I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
Howard,"Okay, I get it."
Howard,"Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now."
Howard,"That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.”"
Howard,"Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"That’s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible."
Howard,"This is what you sound like. I think I’m talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I’m wearing a set of giant dentures."
Howard,Tell him he sounds like that.
Howard,"There’s the problem. You can’t beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy’s a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller."
Howard,"One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."
Howard,Terrible.
Howard,"I can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry."
Howard,You ever hear back from Hawking?
Howard,"So, now all you have to do is let him win."
Howard,What are you waiting for? Hit send.
Howard,So do it.
Howard,Good for you.
Howard,Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
Howard,"Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks."
Howard,"What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?"
Howard,"You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?"
Howard,I know.
Howard,That’s not true.
Howard,There’s some underwear in the hamper.
Howard,"Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place."
Howard,The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
Howard,Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
Howard,"Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great."
Howard,"No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God."
Howard,"My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good."
Howard,And I will.
Howard,I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.
Howard,"She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?"
Howard,"All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it."
Howard,That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.
Howard,"Boy, if these walls could talk."
Howard,Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
Howard,"I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock."
Howard,Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
Howard,"Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room."
Howard,"Fine, let’s go."
Howard,"Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom."
Howard,"Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about."
Howard,"I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her."
Howard,"She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry."
Howard,"You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was."
Howard,Where we going?
Howard,"No, but I want to live here."
Howard,Can’t we talk about this?
Howard,"Oh, you silly doodlebug."
Howard,Do you expect me to build this?
Howard,Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
Howard,"I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time."
Howard,We should figure out where he goes.
Howard,Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
Howard,"Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon."
Howard,Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
Howard,"Well, where are you going?"
Howard,"No, you didn’t."
Howard,Should we follow him?
Howard,"Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?"
Howard,Don’t you know his schedule?
Howard,Come on.
Howard,This is where he goes? What’s in there?
Howard,What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
Howard,Not yet. What are you doing?
Howard,Can’t you face the other way and listen?
Howard,What the hell is he up to?
Howard,Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
Howard,I think we’re more like ninjas.
Howard,"Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,It’s locked.
Howard,"Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…"
Howard,Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.
Howard,"When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini."
Howard,"Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?"
Howard,What?
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,"Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him."
Howard,Are we good?
Howard,I don’t know. The solution to an equation?
Howard,What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
Howard,It’s paprika.
Howard,Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.
Howard,That stuff’s radioactive.
Howard,"Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried."
Howard,Why would you know that?
Howard,"That’s forty-two, dumb-ass."
Howard,We should stop. I’m exhausted.
Howard,Not me.
Howard,Sounds good.
Howard,I have to know!
Howard,"Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working."
Howard,It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.
Howard,"Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock."
Howard,What the hell is that thing?
Howard,Wormhole generator test? 
Howard,"Oh, my God!"
Howard,"Yeah, really sorry."
Howard,But what are you doing in there?
Howard,"Hey, fellas, what’s going on?"
Howard,"Oh, they’re not the same thing."
Howard,Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
Howard,"Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294."
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space."
Howard,"Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car."
Howard,Are you listening to yourself?
Howard,Nope.
Howard,Give it back.
Howard,My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
Howard,"Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back."
Howard,Fine. I’m taking your diploma.
Howard,Hi Sheldon.
Howard,He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
Howard,Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
Howard,You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.
Howard,"Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk."
Howard,What the hell are you doing?
Howard,"Okay, you need to move now."
Howard,You can’t stay there forever.
Howard,"Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,"
Howard,"I’m warning you, Sheldon!"
Howard,Get out of my spot.
Howard,Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
Howard,It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.
Howard,Can you believe this guy?
Howard,"Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream.  "
Howard,What are you doing in there?
Howard,Stop that. You stop that.
Howard,"All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…"
Howard,"I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say."
Howard,"You’re the bigger man, Sheldon."
Howard,"I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Howard,It’s heebie-jeebies.
Howard,Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
Howard,It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
Howard,"Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law."
Howard,"Great, thank you."
Howard,"So, how have you been?"
Howard,Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
Howard,I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?
Howard,I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.
Howard,Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.
Howard,"So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?"
Howard,Had no idea you were the chatty one.
Howard,"Okay, dig in."
Howard,Took the words right out of my mouth.
Howard,"Oh, you like to fish?"
Howard,Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
Howard,"You know, I hadn’t thought of that.  Help me."
Howard,"No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night."
Howard,"Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing."
Howard,"You know, the thing."
Howard,Great.  Thanks for the help.
Howard,I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
Howard,Do either of you guys know how to fish?
Howard,"Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this."
Howard,Ew!
Howard,Really?
Howard,Okay.
Howard,"I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes."
Howard,Fine. There.
Howard,"Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm."
Howard,"No, I’m fine. Keep going."
Howard,"Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday."
Howard,You’re right. Oh! I should do this.
Howard,Here we go. Oh!
Howard,"Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go."
Howard,No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
Howard,Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
Howard,"Wait, now we’re shooting things?"
Howard,"Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them."
Howard,‘Cause Bernadette made me.
Howard,"Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop."
Howard,"So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend."
Howard,"No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion."
Howard,"Really? Thank you, sir."
Howard,"Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?"
Howard,Great couple of gals.
Howard,"But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage."
Howard,I’m your idiot. Forever.
Howard,"I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way."
Howard,"Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
Howard,Can we please move this along?
Howard,"Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile."
Howard,"I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”"
Howard,Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
Howard,What are we supposed to do?
Howard,Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
Howard,"That was amazing, Sheldon."
Howard,Done?
Howard,Good story.
Howard,Great. Let’s do it. 
Howard,"Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that."
Howard,"Wait, what are you doing?"
Howard,"Oh, come on, that can’t be true."
Howard,What’s going on?
Howard,You look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.
Howard,Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
Howard,I don’t know. Seek professional help?
Howard,"Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?"
Howard,Oh.
Howard,"Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in."
Howard,"Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?"
Howard,That is not true. All I did was build a robot.
Howard,"I’m sorry, I’m a feminist, I don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has."
Howard,Has it really only been ten miles?
Howard,"Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it."
Howard,We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
Howard,So what’s our first pose going to be?
Howard,"Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?"
Howard,"Okay, what’s next?"
Howard,"Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!"
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Howard,"Oh, so is mine."
Howard,Car.
Howard,Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?
Howard,I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.
Howard,We’re not with him.
Howard,"Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car."
Howard,I’m with Leonard. I’m done.
Howard,Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
Howard,Let me see.
Howard,"Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler."
Howard,"You’re still out, right?"
Howard,"Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser."
Howard,"Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags."
Howard,"Oh, man. Look at my nose."
Howard,What?
Howard,I can’t believe I wasted all that money.
Howard,Get that waste of money out of my face.
Howard,"Please, I’m working."
Howard,"Oh, yeah? How’s that?"
Howard,I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
Howard,"Yeah, but they’re so expensive."
Howard,"Well, the prices have been coming down."
Howard,"And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…"
Howard,We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.
Howard,"Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?"
Howard,"Eh, what can you do?"
Howard,Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
Howard,"Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure."
Howard,Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
Howard,"All right, you can suck it in a little bit."
Howard,"Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you."
Howard,Say hello to my little friend.
Howard,"I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride."
Howard,I thought you might.
Howard,Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.
Howard,"Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000."
Howard,Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
Howard,It’s kind of dawning on me now.
Howard,What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
Howard,"Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works."
Howard,Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
Howard,Tell me about it.
Howard,"Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards."
Howard,Great. Come on in.
Howard,It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
Howard,"No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s part of a bonus she got."
Howard,Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
Howard,"Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
Howard,"Hey, I got a favour to ask."
Howard,My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
Howard,"She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay."
Howard,Really? What do you got going on?
Howard,"Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot."
Howard,I told her around seven.
Howard,Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?
Howard,What time did you leave?
Howard,What? You spent the night?
Howard,You wore my pyjamas?
Howard,"Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there."
Howard,"If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life."
Howard,"Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you."
Howard,"Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?"
Howard,Here’s some more ice.
Howard,What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
Howard,"Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?"
Howard,"Hey, Raj. What’s up?"
Howard,You’re still at my mother’s?
Howard,"Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one."
Howard,"Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out."
Howard,It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
Howard,"Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed."
Howard,"Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something."
Howard,"Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass."
Howard,Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
Howard,A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
Howard,"Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter."
Howard,"Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?"
Howard,"Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of… "
Howard,"Yes, please."
Howard,Sorry we’re late.
Howard,Terrific. Couldn’t be better.
Howard,"Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is."
Howard,"She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling."
Howard,I said I’m sorry.
Howard,"I told you, turn them inside out."
Howard,"Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will."
Howard,"Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry."
Howard,I love you.
Howard,So where’d you hide it?
Howard,"Damn it, it’s in the washing machine."
Howard,"I’m telling you, something’s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble."
Howard,You in there?
Howard,We’re worried about you.
Howard,"You didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?"
Howard,"I’m sorry. That’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off."
Howard,"Oh, you’re kidding. Let me see. Well, I’ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf."
Howard,Now what?
Howard,He’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.
Howard,He’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.
Howard,"You’re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated."
Howard,"Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history."
Howard,"Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate."
Howard,"Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on."
Howard,"Oh, come on, Raj."
Howard,"Boy, I want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy."
Howard,"All right. Well, I’ll see you around."
Howard,Okay.
Howard,All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
Howard,I got whine.
Howard,"Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower."
Howard,"Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura."
Howard,"Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox."
Howard,"So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?"
Howard,Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
Howard,"Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students."
Howard,What exactly are you looking up?
Howard,"Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes."
Howard,"Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd."
Howard,"So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  Hey."
Howard,Nothing.
Howard,"The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them."
Howard,"No, but I did go to the International Space Station."
Howard,"No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…"
Howard,"No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?"
Howard,"Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here."
Howard,"Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?"
Howard,Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
Howard,Milady.
Howard,You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.
Howard,"Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex."
Howard,They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.
Howard,Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
Howard,You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
Howard,"Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label."
Howard,"No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there."
Howard,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Howard,Colour’s fine.
Howard,"You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home."
Howard,Juggle.
Howard,"Whoa, you opened this?"
Howard,"I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home."
Howard,"If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here."
Howard,Do whatever you want.
Howard,"Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep."
Howard,It’s this stupid letter.
Howard,No.
Howard,"Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?"
Howard,He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
Howard,Something I should have done a long time ago. 
Howard,Yep.
Howard,I do.  Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
Howard,Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
Howard,I am.
Howard,What?
Howard,"Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you."
Howard,What? Us? Who else knows?
Howard,So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
Howard,How could you do this?
Howard,"No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go."
Howard,In here.
Howard,It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
Howard,"Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid."
Howard,"I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those."
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah, what’s that?"
Howard,Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.
Howard,Really?
Howard,Hmm.
Howard,Yeah. I’m terrific.
Howard,"Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true."
Howard,"That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys."
Howard,"Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats."
Howard,"We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong."
Howard,Yeah?
Howard,That’s terrible.
Howard,"Show a little compassion, a man died."
Howard,You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?
Howard,Money from family does come with strings attached.
Howard,Asthma attack?
Howard,You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?
Howard,"Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats."
Howard,"Ooh, meerkat fight!"
Howard,You could talk some smack about his mother.
Howard,So is tenure.
Howard,"I think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out."
Howard,Why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.
Howard,What?
Howard,Cool. Anything juicy?
Howard,"You know what’s going on, don’t you?"
Howard,I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.
Howard,Keep reading. What does it say?
Howard,It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading.
Howard,"Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera."
Howard,Should I go?
Howard,Ready to go to lunch?
Howard,Yeah. Let’s go.
Howard,What’s going on?
Howard,Just a little? That’s great.
Howard,"Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game."
Howard,"Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
Howard,So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
Howard,The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
Howard,"However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it."
Howard,I don’t know. Go with hockey.
Howard,Why don’t you put her in a kennel?
Howard,"To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine."
Howard,You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
Howard,How’d you get him to come to your house?
Howard,"You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?"
Howard,"Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?"
Howard,Classy dog.
Howard,"She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
Howard,It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
Howard,"Yeah, that’s what I was doing."
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone."
Howard,"I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note."
Howard,"No, I wasn’t. You were."
Howard,"Yes, you were!."
Howard,Cinnamon!
Howard,"Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy."
Howard,Nice.
Howard,"When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on."
Howard,Cinnamon!
Howard,"Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?"
Howard,"It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs.  It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk."
Howard,What?
Howard,You have her?
Howard,I’m really sorry.
Howard,Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
Howard,"The ladies are away, the boys will play."
Howard,"Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?"
Howard,Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?
Howard,Ready whenever you guys are.
Howard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
Howard,"We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend."
Howard,"Uh, it does. "
Howard,What are you doing back?
Howard,"A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D."
Howard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!"
Howard,What do you do?
Howard,The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.
Howard,"Uh, fifteen or higher."
Howard,"Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."
Howard,"The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano."
Howard,"But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack."
Howard,"Fine.  You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot."
Howard,It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
Howard,Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure."
Howard,Oh.
Howard,"The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?"
Howard,"Leonard, I may have gotten you a job."
Howard,"No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you."
Howard,"Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen."
Howard,Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
Howard,What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
Howard,"Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary."
Howard,"I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something."
Howard,Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
Howard,"You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water."
Howard,Cheers.
Howard,It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
Howard,It must’ve killed you when I went to space.
Howard,"Buddy, you okay? Oh, man."
Howard,"Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy."
Howard,I’m proud of you.
Howard,"Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new."
Howard,"Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie."
Howard,"Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you."
Howard,Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.
Howard,How’d it go?
Howard,Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
Howard,"I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
Howard,"Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. "
Howard,It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
Howard,Looks like she accepted your apology.
Howard,"Oh, please, you did not have a moment."
Howard,"Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment."
Howard,"There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
Howard,So nothing.
Howard,"What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?"
Howard,Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.
Howard,"I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on."
Howard,I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage."
Howard,"Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying."
Howard,Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
Howard,"‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back."
Howard,I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?
Howard,Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
Howard,You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
Howard,Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.
Howard,I feel so stupid. And fat.
Howard,"Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything. "
Howard,Thanks for coming over.
Howard,"Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven."
Howard,"Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?"
Howard,"Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question."
Howard,Seriously?
Howard,Fine.
Howard,"Yeah, they kind of do."
Howard,"Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
Howard,"Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. "
Howard,You think?
Howard,"Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie’s ready."
Howard,"That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here."
Howard,Stop it.
Howard,"I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it."
Howard,"So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?"
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry."
Howard,Hallelujah.
Howard,Why?
Howard,"Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there."
Howard,"Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college."
Howard,And Princeton.
Howard,"Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?"
Howard,"Wow, you’re really good at puzzles."
Howard,"If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake."
Howard,Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
Howard,Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
Howard,It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.
Howard,"Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?"
Howard,"Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think."
Howard,I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.
Howard,"Hey, how about some music?"
Howard,Find something you like.
Howard,"Yeah, I love Neil Diamond."
Howard,"Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see."
Howard,"Hey, you know what this could mean ."
Howard,That’s it. 
Howard,On the boats and on the planes. 
Howard,Never looking back again. 
Howard,"They’re coming to America, They’re coming to America."
Howard,Today!
Howard,Love on the rocks. 
Howard,Just pour me a drink.
Howard,Let’s go.
Howard,"Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,"
Howard,"Cherry, baby"
Howard,Cherry
Howard,Halle Berry. Why?
Howard,Because her life wasn’t enough?
Howard,"Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first."
Howard,"Leonard, you ready for lunch?"
Howard,"Hi, Penny."
Howard,Wow. Sex at work?
Howard,Sorry. 
Howard,Damn. How’d you swing that?
Howard,Seriously?
Howard,You sound kind of proud of it.
Howard,"Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
Howard,How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
Howard,That’s it? No compassion?
Howard,Bernie…
Howard,I’m sharing my pain.
Howard,I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
Howard,"I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python."
Howard,"I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes."
Howard,"Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. "
Howard,Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
Howard,Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
Howard,"I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
Howard,"Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear."
Howard,"No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
Howard,"Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other."
Howard,"For the love of God, why?"
Howard,It’s nothing in particular. I…
Howard,My arm is feeling numb.
Howard,"My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
Howard,"Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?"
Howard,Bernie…
Howard,"Please, stop talking."
Howard,"I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you."
Howard,I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.
Howard,"Ooh, shrimp was spicy."
Howard,You got the tropical fruit kind?
Howard,"Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk.  I’ll get it."
Howard,"Oh, hi."
Howard,"Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either."
Howard,That’s not true.
Howard,"Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority."
Howard,"Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game."
Howard,Should I go after you?
Howard,Thanks for getting me in trouble.
Howard,Pull.
Howard,Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
Howard,"Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
Howard,"Guys, listen up. "
Howard,Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
Howard,"I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
Howard,Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
Howard,"Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together."
Howard,Sheldon?
Howard,So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?
Howard,Great. Will you play the ukulele?
Howard,"Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
Howard,"Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon."
Howard,"So, what happens next?"
Howard,Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.
Howard,E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.
Howard,"No, I want this to be romantic."
Howard,I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.
Howard,"Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab."
Howard,"Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine."
Howard,"Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?"
Howard,You’re sure you’re okay?
Howard,"Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in."
Howard,"Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
Howard,"A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom."
Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette."
Howard,"If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam. "
Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette."
Howard,Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
Howard,Doing what?
Howard,You’re going to girls’ night.
Howard,You know they’re making jewellery right?
Howard,Not his testosterone levels.
Howard,How is that possible?
Howard,You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
Howard,"It’s true, you’d rust."
Howard,"Hello, everyone."
Howard,Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.
Howard,"So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
Howard,"Oh, that’s actually pretty nice."
Howard,"You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff."
Howard,Be right back.
Howard,Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
Howard,Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
Howard,"Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. "
Howard,"Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
Howard,"Okay, who’s up first?"
Howard,"I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet."
Howard,"You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it."
Howard,Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.
Howard,"Whoa, where is that coming from?"
Howard,How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
Howard,Since when can’t you open up with me?
Howard,"Buddy, I was just joking around. "
Howard,You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
Howard,"Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?"
Howard,You didn’t have to do that.
Howard,"Wow, this is so cool. Thanks."
Howard,Wow.
Howard,"So, you can never take it off?"
Howard,"So, you’re just an idiot?"
Howard,Is the point that you’re an idiot?
Howard,And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
Howard,You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?
Howard,You had to be taught not to play with cobras?
Howard,"Hey, what’re you working on?"
Howard,That’s a pretty cool idea.
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin."
Howard,I believe this is yours.
Howard,"You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence."
Howard,"Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house."
Howard,"Come on, it’ll be fun."
Howard,"Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy."
Howard,Sheldon.
Howard,"Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away."
Howard,"Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her."
Howard,I have a better idea.
Howard,I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
Howard,"Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek."
Howard,He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
Howard,Does he?
Howard,Really?
Howard,So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?
Howard,"You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys."
Howard,What’s with you?
Howard,Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
Howard,You ever play football?
Howard,No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
Howard,Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
Howard,"Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz."
Howard,That’s why I sit.
Howard,Anyone need a beer?
Howard,Thank God.
Howard,Here you go.
Howard,"I never had a beer with my dad, either."
Howard,Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
Howard,They’re drinking beer and watching football. 
Howard,They don’t want me.
Howard,"Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…"
Howard,Don’t worry about it.
Howard,"Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me."
Howard,I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.
Howard,"Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse."
Howard,I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.
Howard,"Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?"
Howard,Then you left me no choice.
Howard,"I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs."
Howard,"For a whole week, the nerve of some people."
Howard,You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
Howard,Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.
Howard,"No, we were waiting for you."
Howard,Yeah. So what do you feel like making?
Howard,"No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot."
Howard,"Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone."
Howard,I thought of you the whole time.
Howard,How do you know I didn’t do them?
Howard,"Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park."
Howard,Just go.
Howard,What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
Howard,"No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
Howard,I don’t want coffee.
Howard,Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
Howard,"Um, is this getting weird?"
Howard,"So, yes."
Howard,"What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?"
Howard,"Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. "
Howard,"Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em."
Howard,"I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them."
Howard,I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.
Howard,Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.
Howard,You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
Howard,"Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
Howard,That is not… he’s doing it again. 
Howard,I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.
Howard,Howdy.
Howard,Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room.
Howard,"I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen."
Howard,"Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes."
Howard,"Fine, then go talk to her on your own."
Howard,She nailed it.
Howard,"Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me."
Howard,"Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum."
Howard,More.
Howard,I lived with her to save money.
Howard,Not exactly.
Howard,"Well, things would be a little different."
Howard,I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving.
Howard,"You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother."
Howard,"Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead."
Howard,You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.
Howard,"Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly."
Howard,And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
Howard,"Oh, yeah"
Howard,What’s your part?
Howard,"If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom."
Howard,We’ll be there.
Howard,Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
Howard,"If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
Howard,"I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary."
Howard,That stinks.
Howard,Where’s Sheldon?
Howard,Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
Howard,"Well, I’d be able to tell anyway."
Howard,"Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms."
Howard,"Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…"
Howard,I’m in the middle of something.
Howard,Anybody home?
Howard,Hi.
Howard,You’re both into rock?
Howard,"Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you."
Howard,"You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay."
Howard,Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?
Howard,There you go. 
Howard,"So, what is she doing today?"
Howard,The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
Howard,"Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel."
Howard,"Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino."
Howard,Tammy Cho.
Howard,Arlene Russel.
Howard,Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
Howard,That’s how you reject a guy.
Howard,"No, don’t."
Howard,You want us to talk to him?
Howard,Let’s go.
Howard,Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
Howard,"Really, really sorry."
Howard,T-minus 60 seconds.
Howard,T Minus 45 seconds.
Howard,T-minus 30 seconds.
Howard,15 seconds.
Howard,"Five, four, three, two, one. "
Howard,Nope.
Howard,It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.
Howard,Great.
Howard,Damn.
Howard,Really?
Howard,I can’t believe we’re not going.
Howard,"Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo."
Howard,I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
Howard,"Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention."
Howard,"Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over."
Howard,And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
Howard,What do you mean?
Howard,Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
Howard,Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
Howard,I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
Howard,Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.
Howard,Do what?
Howard,No need. I’m breaking rules all the time. 
Howard,Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
Howard,Yeah. What about it?
Howard,He just parked. He’s on his way up.
Howard,"Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
Howard,"Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
Howard,"I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup."
Howard,"Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now."
Howard,"I’m sorry, what?"
Howard,I don’t own a pocket watch.
Howard,"Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train."
Howard,Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
Howard,"A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world."
Howard,You okay?
Howard,"Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos."
Howard,I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
Howard,She’s right. 
Howard,I had a little to do with it.
Howard,I am.
Howard,I love you so much.
Howard,Sorry.
Howard,There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
Howard,I’m thinking about growing a goatee.
Howard,He said it.
Howard,Say what?
Howard,He said it.
Howard,"Hey, how come we never get that option?"
Howard,Check it out.
Howard,"Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff."
Howard,Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
Howard,"Well, that’s the last time I play with that.  I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137"
Howard,Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.
Howard,That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
Howard,I told them I’d be honoured.
Howard,"And I’m gonna miss you, too."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
Howard,"No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs."
Howard,"Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it."
Howard,What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
Howard,Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
Howard,I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
Howard,"But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good."
Howard,"Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello."
Howard,What’s going on?
Howard,"Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons."
Howard,Massimino? Why are you here?
Howard,Sure.
Howard,You don’t think I did a good job up there?
Howard,"Fine, maybe I was a little scared."
Howard,You’re supposed to do that.
Howard,Hang on. That was just me joking around.
Howard,"Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot."
Howard,"Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it."
Howard,Really?
Howard,You’ve got to get me out of this.
Howard,Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.  
Howard,"Hi, Ma. How are you?"
Howard,"Go, go, go."
Howard,"Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest."
Howard,"Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it."
Howard,"Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one."
Howard,You mean tings like moo-stache?
Howard,"Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me."
Howard,Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Howard,"Hey, I work at the same university you do."
Howard,I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.
Howard,The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends."
Howard,"Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off."
Howard,"Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other."
Howard,"Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre."
Howard,No.
Howard,I really don’t think we do tha…
Howard,Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
Howard,Will you please sto…
Howard,That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.
Howard,"Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car."
Howard,You’re the reason I’m doing it.
Howard,How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
Howard,"Hey, buddy."
Howard,It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
Howard,Buzz Aldrin.
Howard,What now?
Howard,You just went to the bathroom.
Howard,"Well, it still doesn’t."
Howard,Fine.
Howard,"I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things."
Howard,"When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,No.
Howard,Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
Howard,"Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one."
Howard,I’m gonna need that bag back.
Howard,"I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault."
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Howard,It’s over.
Howard,Should we stop holding hands now?
Howard,"Okay, good."
Howard,Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
Howard,We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.
Howard,"Oh, boy."
Howard,I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
Howard,"Okay, give me the flowers and pie."
Howard,They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
Howard,What’s wrong?
Howard,"What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on."
Howard,You ready to talk about it?
Howard,"Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?"
Howard,"Well, did she see you in the window?"
Howard,Then don’t say anything.
Howard,"Well, don’t do it on the phone."
Howard,"That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off."
Howard,"Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business."
Howard,Good luck.
Howard,While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
Howard,"Hey, can I come in?"
Howard,"That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom."
Howard,"You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself."
Howard,I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
Howard,"Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it."
Howard,"Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why."
Howard,All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
Howard,And the healing begins.
Howard,Both great.
Howard,Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
Howard,"What do you mean, yes?"
Howard,No. Were you seeing other men?
Howard,Were you like this when I married you?
Howard,"He’s gonna die alone, right?"
Howard,Only without the sex.
Howard,Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
Howard,And?
Howard,I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
Howard,She is. But I like that attitude.
Howard,You’re reading Cosmo?
Howard,What’s this?
Howard,"So, you and Emily still together?"
Howard,I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.
Howard,"Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?"
Howard,"Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe."
Howard,I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.
Howard,You got it.
Howard,You took ballet?
Howard,"Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it."
Howard,"Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl."
Howard,"In a bad way, very bad."
Howard,"Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey."
Howard,"Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so."
Howard,"Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van."
Howard,That must be it.
Howard,Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?
Howard,"It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…"
Howard,Can I finish my astronaut story?
Howard,Please don’t say it.
Howard,Please don’t say it.
Howard,You’re saying it.
Howard,"Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom."
Howard,"One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again."
Howard,"I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
Howard,"Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am."
Howard,"Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Howard,"Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you."
Howard,"Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on."
Howard,I’m just saying…
Howard,Okay. Fine.
Howard,"Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me."
Howard,I need some fresh air.
Howard,You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?
Howard,"Ugh. Me, too. What happened?"
Howard,I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
Howard,"Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two."
Howard,"Get out of here, Barry."
Howard,Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.
Howard,"Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine."
Howard,"Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?"
Howard,"Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit."
Howard,A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.
Howard,"That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit."
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you."
Howard,"Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie."
Howard,And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
Howard,What difference does it make?
Howard,"Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her."
Howard,"Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her."
Howard,"Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.  Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me."
Howard,I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.
Howard,No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.
Howard,You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
Howard,You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
Howard,"Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time."
Howard,"Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters."
Howard,I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
Howard,Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
Howard,That’s what good friends would do.
Howard,"Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV."
Howard,"Me, too."
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Obviously.
Howard,"Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch."
Howard,"Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over."
Howard,"Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box."
Howard,The doctor says you need to get exercise.
Howard,Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
Howard,She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
Howard,"Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out."
Howard,"Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room."
Howard,You mean a forklift?
Howard,I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.
Howard,"Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?"
Howard,"Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz."
Howard,We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
Howard,Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
Howard,Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
Howard,As advertised.
Howard,It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
Howard,"No, it’s not."
Howard,Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
Howard,"Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby."
Howard,"I’m coming, you big baby."
Howard,"Shh, I just got her to sleep."
Howard,What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
Howard,Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
Howard,"A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen."
Howard,"Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people."
Howard,Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
Howard,How you feeling?
Howard,I’m proud of us.
Howard,Welcome to Team Putz.
Howard,"She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
Howard,"Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them."
Howard,A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.
Howard,Because you had sex the other night?
Howard,Why?
Howard,"You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
Howard,"Oh, come on, give her a chance."
Howard,"Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea."
Howard,"Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months."
Howard,"Well, what if we use our vacation time?"
Howard,I don’t know what else we can do.
Howard,"Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?"
Howard,Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
Howard,"I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
Howard,You sure?
Howard,You call her Debbie?
Howard,Was that a little weird?
Howard,"Okay, let’s go."
Howard,What’s wrong with your car?
Howard,Why?
Howard,What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.
Howard,I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.
Howard,"He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird."
Howard,"I don’t know, they’re, chummy."
Howard,"No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog."
Howard,"I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out."
Howard,"First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life."
Howard,I said well past it.
Howard,"Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be."
Howard,"Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out."
Howard,It’s not that precious.
Howard,Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.
Howard,"It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother."
Howard,"Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?"
Howard,Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?
Howard,This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
Howard,"Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon."
Howard,She did?
Howard,"You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird."
Howard,"It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?"
Howard,Your mother and I? You’re not my father.
Howard,"Well, I didn’t say I was your father."
Howard,"Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules."
Howard,Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.
Howard,"Yeah, in my house."
Howard,What a sick use of science.
Howard,"Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
Howard,"So, Penny, when’s the new job start?"
Howard,Why is it your last name and her first name?
Howard,And you love the sound of your own voice.
Howard,Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?
Howard,"Hey, what if I took your class?"
Howard,"I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?"
Howard,"Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
Howard,"I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign."
Howard,"Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?"
Howard,"Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists."
Howard,No.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot."
Howard,Okay.
Howard,I am.
Howard,It’s an inverted cycloid.
Howard,That’s where I’m a little fuzzy.
Howard,"If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…"
Howard,Okay.
Howard,Making a straw.
Howard,So I can shoot you with a spitball.
Howard,Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again.
Howard,You reported me to human resources?
Howard,"Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy."
Howard,"I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you."
Howard,"Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?"
Howard,"Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?"
Howard,"That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?"
Howard,"Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg."
Howard,"Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?"
Howard,Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!
Howard,"So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?"
Howard,All right.
Howard,What’s that about?
Howard,"The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?"
Howard,"Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me."
Howard,"All right, here we go."
Howard,Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.
Howard,"Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game."
Howard,"For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five."
Howard,They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.
Howard,"Thank you, that would be great."
Howard,What’s wrong with the way I run?
Howard,"Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out."
Howard,Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
Howard,How about now?
Howard,Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
Howard,Are you kidding me?!
Howard,There’s no way this is sixty feet.
Howard,You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
Howard,"That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
Howard,That was a close one.
Howard,Heads up! Watch out!
Howard,"Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?"
Howard,Why shouldn’t I do it?
Howard,But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?
Howard,"Well, maybe I’ll do a good job."
Howard,"Okay, thanks for the pep talk."
Howard,"Thanks. I’m proud of me, too."
Howard,Let’s do it.
Howard,Wish me luck.
Howard,Thank you. Thank you.
Howard,"I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch."
Howard,‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
Howard,"Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars."
Howard,"Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster."
Howard,What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,Since when do you read social science?
Howard,I don’t want to talk about it.
Howard,"My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven."
Howard,"Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too."
Howard,"Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?"
Howard,"All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?"
Howard,That does sound fun.
Howard,"You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride."
Howard,"Toy stores, puppet shows."
Howard,We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
Howard,You say things like that all the time.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry."
Howard,"Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
Howard,He’s right.
Howard,"Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity."
Howard,But you didn’t hear what it was.
Howard,"Oh, come on."
Howard,It’s to help reopen the comic book store.
Howard,"Well, hear me out."
Howard,"I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money."
Howard,"I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together."
Howard,"Well, I don’t like to talk about it."
Howard,That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
Howard,"Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house."
Howard,I’m always welcome.
Howard,What?
Howard,"Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala."
Howard,With comfy seats.
Howard,"Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
Howard,No one wants to hear it.
Howard,Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
Howard,"And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
Howard,You admit Amy’s a distraction?
Howard,It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
Howard,My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
Howard,Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.
Howard,"Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
Howard,Here we go.
Howard,Oh. I never saw that.
Howard,Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
Howard,"Mm, that was mine."
Howard,Also mine.
Howard,There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
Howard,"No, it vibrates. Keep going."
Howard,We got to watch Back to the Future II.
Howard,"Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in."
Howard,What?
Howard,"Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
Howard,"Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling."
Howard,"Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener."
Howard,Like behavior modification?
Howard,We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
Howard,"That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,Negative reinforcement is really wrong?
Howard,Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
Howard,"How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?"
Howard,"Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?"
Howard,I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.
Howard,So what did you want to know?
Howard,You didn’t have to say so much more.
Howard,"I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too."
Howard,"For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay."
Howard,There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
Howard,Not a lot.
Howard,Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
Howard,"For the tenth time, that was a Groupon."
Howard,Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
Howard,"Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart."
Howard,Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.
Howard,That pan had to soak and you know it.
Howard,"It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends."
Howard,It’s okay.
Howard,"I want that, too."
Howard,"Ooh, laser tag, laser tag."
Howard,How’d you get that?
Howard,"Wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
Howard,We know.
Howard,A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
Howard,"Oh, come on. It’s a replica."
Howard,"Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife."
Howard,"Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?"
Howard,Stick your head in there and find out.
Howard,It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld."
Howard,That’s fine. I don’t care.
Howard,They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
Howard,"Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating."
Howard,Like you and your dog.
Howard,"Fine, it bothers me. You happy?"
Howard,How is this helpful?
Howard,Hey.
Howard,She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
Howard,"Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling."
Howard,Yep.
Howard,You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
Howard,"I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone."
Howard,What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.
Howard,"Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?"
Howard,"Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?"
Howard,Do you like her because you both have red hair?
Howard,"Oh, my God."
Howard,That’s Jeanie.
Howard,Don’t say it.
Howard,"She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it."
Howard,Raj.
Howard,"So, my mother’s okay with this?"
Howard,"‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship."
Howard,Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
Howard,"Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?"
Howard,"So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are."
Howard,What?
Howard,"Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here."
Howard,You sure you’re okay?
Howard,You don’t look okay.
Howard,"Knock, knock."
Howard,"Told you, not funny."
Howard,"So, how you doing?"
Howard,Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.
Howard,"As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up."
Howard,What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.
Howard,"They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on."
Howard,How can I convince you it won’t?
Howard,I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.
Howard,And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.
Howard,"Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful."
Howard,"Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel."
Howard,"I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…"
Howard,Not important.
Howard,Not important.
Howard,"Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another."
Howard,All right.
Howard,Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.
Howard,"I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that."
Howard,"See, I am. Isn’t this great?"
Howard,I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
Howard,And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster.
Howard,We’re just saying all the things we love about each other.
Howard,Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
Howard,"Makes you think. Oh, well."
Howard,I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.
Howard,"Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade."
Howard,"Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too."
Howard,That’s intense.
Howard,Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
Howard,Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
Howard,Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
Howard,"Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check."
Howard,Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
Howard,"Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis."
Howard,"Oh, let’s do that."
Howard,"Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word."
Howard,Are we sure this is the place?
Howard,We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
Howard,Seriously?
Howard,"I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
Howard,"Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered."
Howard,I love that.
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Howard,"Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York."
Howard,I agree.
Howard,We should get going to Amy’s.
Howard,"I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty."
Howard,How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
Howard,I thought you did.
Howard,"You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
Howard,And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
Howard,"Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it."
Howard,Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
Howard,"Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do."
Howard,"Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up."
Howard,It’s all I could find. It’ll work.
Howard,"Okay, well, what’s your plan?"
Howard,And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
Howard,Why do you keep assuming it was me?
Howard,Like when?
Howard,"Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys."
Howard,"Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?"
Howard,You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
Howard,Stay out of this.
Howard,"You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me."
Howard,"I said, stay out of it."
Howard,"Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out."
Howard,How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?
Howard,Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
Howard,"Yeah, I do."
Howard,"Okay. One, two, three."
Howard,"On three. One, two, three."
Howard,"It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
Howard,"Uh, maybe it’s just stunned."
Howard,"Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again."
Howard,"When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious."
Howard,Great. Do it.
Howard,No. I need to do it. This is on me.
Howard,I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
Howard,"Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive."
Howard,"I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain."
Howard,"You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault."
Howard,Can’t do what?
Howard,We can’t do that.
Howard,It smelled too much like blue jay.
Howard,Will you please relax?
Howard,"Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
Howard,Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
Howard,"I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…"
Howard,A story can do two things.
Howard,"You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?"
Howard,Maybe you need to do something more productive.
Howard,"So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
Howard,The man who crashed his stationary bike.
Howard,You happy? Now you can relax.
Howard,"I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?"
Howard,"Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels."
Howard,"Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out."
Howard,You love that movie.
Howard,I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
Howard,"Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house."
Howard,"Yeah, but you’re a scientist."
Howard,"So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?"
Howard,No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.
Howard,"Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe."
Howard,"You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine."
Howard,"Here we go, my first Hindu temple."
Howard,Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
Howard,"Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?"
Howard,Like am I dressed okay?
Howard,"I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass."
Howard,That’s nice.
Howard,Raj.
Howard,"Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine."
Howard,I invented a game. You want to play?
Howard,"It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog."
Howard,"Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it."
Howard,"Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters."
Howard,What do you mean?
Howard,Hold on. What’s in it for us?
Howard,"Okay, we’ll do it."
Howard,Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?
Howard,"Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair."
Howard,"Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all."
Howard,"Yes, we can."
Howard,Nah.
Howard,"Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you’re the tiebreaker."
Howard,It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more."
Howard,"I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody."
Howard,"Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?"
Howard,You look like you got some rest.
Howard,"Yeah, no problem."
Howard,"Well, um, we were just kidding around."
Howard,"Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog."
Howard,"Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
Howard,"How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?"
Howard,It wasn’t that bad.
Howard,What are you doing?
Howard,This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka."
Howard,"Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face."
Howard,"How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?"
Howard,"Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely."
Howard,"Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?"
Howard,"Yeah, well, sometimes you work late."
Howard,That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.
Howard,You really did a nice job.
Howard,"I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?"
Howard,Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
Howard,Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
Howard,"Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay."
Howard,"Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother."
Howard,Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere.
Howard,"It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art."
Howard,That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.
Howard,"I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy."
Howard,Hold that thought.  Hello?
Howard,No.
Howard,My mom died.
Howard,"Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up."
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,"No, it’s okay. What?"
Howard,Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?
Howard,"All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,"
Howard,I really did mean first.
Howard,The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
Howard,"So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?"
Howard,"Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth."
Howard,"No, I’m not leaving without her."
Howard,I could’ve driven her.
Howard,The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.
Howard,"Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here."
Howard,Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
Howard,How are the taxes going?
Howard,Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
Howard,"Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, what’s up?"
Howard,Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
Howard,"She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans."
Howard,What’s wrong?
Howard,So?
Howard,Why were you looking in it?
Howard,"Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there."
Howard,"You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go."
Howard,Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.
Howard,"Okay, let me see the damage."
Howard,"Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it."
Howard,Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
Howard,Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
Howard,It’s fine. You just need two more nails.
Howard,In Emily’s eyes.
Howard,We should hang up.
Howard,"But we’re not going to, are we?"
Howard,What happened to snooping is wrong?
Howard,Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
Howard,"Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories."
Howard,"Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."
Howard,"Stuart, we’re here."
Howard,"Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him."
Howard,"Wait, when did it go out?"
Howard,"Oh, my God."
Howard,It’s all defrosting.
Howard,"It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one."
Howard,No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
Howard,I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.
Howard,All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
Howard,Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.
Howard,"Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah."
Howard,"No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself."
Howard,"No, that’s noodle kugel."
Howard,"Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking."
Howard,"Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started."
Howard,I’m never gonna talk to her again.
Howard,No. I want to do this.
Howard,Okay.
Howard,"Hey, guys."
Howard,"I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion."
Howard,"Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
Howard,That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.
Howard,Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
Howard,I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
Howard,"Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real."
Howard,You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
Howard,It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
Howard,"All right, Amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75."
Howard,Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
Howard,"Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it."
Howard,"Well, I guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind."
Howard,We’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
Howard,"We’re not selling it, it’s mine."
Howard,That’s not fair. It’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
Howard,I would do that.
Howard,"Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods."
Howard,"That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles."
Howard,"That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me."
Howard,So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
Howard,"Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, ’cause I don’t have a third one. Yes. Woo."
Howard,"Yeah, what?"
Howard,"Don’t listen to her. You and I go way back, we’re like brothers."
Howard,"This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?"
Howard,She’s my champion.
Howard,"You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you."
Howard,"Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on."
Howard,"One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
Howard,Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.
Howard,"It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over."
Howard,"Don’t listen to her, just hit the ball."
Howard,"No, I’m not."
Howard,"No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?"
Howard,"I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?"
Howard,Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
Howard,"Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass."
Howard,"Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is."
Howard,Nope.
Howard,"Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down."
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"Wuh, uh, who’s your father?"
Howard,Sam Wolowitz is my father.
Howard,"Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?"
Howard,"Bernadette, weird things are happening out here."
Howard,"You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee."
Howard,"No, I got it."
Howard,"Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?"
Howard,"I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this."
Howard,"Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy."
Howard,"Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question."
Howard,"I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
Howard,"Well, I hope I get to see you again."
Howard,"Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game."
Howard,That’s not what she meant.
Howard,It was actually just a mechanical hand.
Howard,You are my brother.
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,Good for you.
Howard,"Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities."
Howard,"Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?"
Howard,I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
Howard,"Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
Howard,First take a picture with me.
Howard,"Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese."
Howard,You betcha. The very one.
Howard,I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.
Howard,With my honeybunch.
Howard,No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
Howard,"In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge."
Howard,You don’t think I’m a leader?
Howard,Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.
Howard,All by myself.
Howard,Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
Howard,"Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?"
Howard,Hello.
Howard,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?"
Howard,I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
Howard,Sure.
Howard,"Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese."
Howard,I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
Howard,The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
Howard,You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.
Howard,It’s not always.
Howard,He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
Howard,You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.
Howard,"Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us."
Howard,I’ll figure it out.
Howard,Nice. Where were you when I was single?
Howard,Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
Howard,"Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image."
Howard,Maybe we should recalibrate it.
Howard,"Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Sheldon.
Howard,Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
Howard,Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
Howard,It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
Howard,"No red and yellow, no red and yellow."
Howard,It’s green.
Howard,"Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off."
Howard,"Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up."
Howard,"Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run."
Howard,"Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces."
Howard,"Yes, of course."
Howard,"Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
Howard,That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
Howard,I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station.
Howard,"It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Relax, it’ll be fine."
Howard,Calm down.
Howard,"Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip."
Howard,One toy at a time.
Howard,Suicide.
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
Howard,Ha-ha.
Howard,"All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?"
Howard,GPS?
Howard,Battery charged?
Howard,All right. All systems go. In five…
Howard,Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have. 
Howard,"What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to."
Howard,"Hang on, hang on. It’s working. I did it."
Howard,"No idea, but I did it."
Howard,"Well, I’m not flying it."
Howard,I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be."
Howard,Kiss-ass.
Howard,Sorry we have to do this.
Howard,She doesn’t baby me.
Howard,"For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck."
Howard,"You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess."
Howard,"That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it."
Howard,"Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave."
Howard,One more time?
Howard,"Like, a random person or somebody she knew?"
Howard,"Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge."
Howard,Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
Howard,How are you saying that with a straight face?
Howard,"Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life."
Howard,"That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for."
Howard,You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
Howard,I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.
Howard,We should have done it months ago.
Howard,"Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that."
Howard,"Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer."
Howard,"Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer."
Howard,"Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness."
Howard,Good luck.
Howard,Never should have told you my middle name.
Howard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Howard,It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
Howard,His middle name is David. Go.
Howard,You need to take that?
Howard,"Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy."
Howard,I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
Howard,I’m on it.
Howard,I’m not taking sides.
Howard,"Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
Howard,We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
Howard,Everything’s gonna be okay.
Howard,I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
Howard,I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
Howard,I did.
Howard,Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
Howard,"You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two."
Howard,"Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!"
Howard,"Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself."
Howard,Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?
Howard,"And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it."
Howard,And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.
Howard,"And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?"
Howard,250 dollars an hour. Why?
Howard,"Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things."
Howard,"Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on."
Howard,Why are marine biologists always so cute?
Howard,Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
Howard,"Leonard, wait."
Howard,I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
Howard,"Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you."
Howard,Right now.
Howard,"Wow, okay."
Howard,I told you to put tape on his mouth.
Howard,"Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting."
Howard,Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
Howard,I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
Howard,We are going to Me-hi-co.
Howard,"Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize."
Howard,You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
Howard,"Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
Howard,I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
Howard,"Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants."
Howard,I think it’s a tyre.
Howard,It’s the tyre.
Howard,Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
Howard,"Wow, this one’s really stuck."
Howard,"No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up."
Howard,What are you doing?
Howard,Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.
Howard,Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
Howard,What makes you say that?
Howard,"No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision."
Howard,We have plenty of food for the animals.
Howard,Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
Howard,It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
Howard,"Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters."
Howard,Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
Howard,"You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match."
Howard,How could Archie defeat Predator?
Howard,"Hey, Stuart."
Howard,Why?
Howard,What kind of music are you thinking of?
Howard,"Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing."
Howard,"You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on for years."
Howard,"It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends."
Howard,Footprints on the Moon.
Howard,So did I.
Howard,"Is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my."
Howard,Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.
Howard,"Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma."
Howard,Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.
Howard,"Oh, man, that rocks."
Howard,Yeah?
Howard,Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.
Howard,"Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song."
Howard,"You played it for Emily, didn’t you?"
Howard,"You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t like it."
Howard,The past was lunch. You know what’s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
Howard,"Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you."
Howard,Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?
Howard,I don’t need this. I’m quitting the band.
Howard,Then get out of my house.
Howard,"Raj, wait."
Howard,"Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
Howard,"Oh, one sec."
Howard,"No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising."
Howard,"Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young."
Howard,"The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her."
Howard,"You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high."
Howard,"Well said, Puss."
Howard,And maybe a little Princess Bride.
Howard,Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
Howard,"When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?"
Howard,He’s a righty.
Howard,"Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow."
Howard,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Howard,I thought you were Puss in Boots.
Howard,My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
Howard,"Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl."
Howard,"Oh, boy."
Howard,What’s up?
Howard,Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
Howard,"If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions."
Howard,Maybe he’s not for you.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money."
Howard,What was wrong with that guy?
Howard,"Hey, I want to try."
Howard,"Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
Howard,Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
Howard,"I love you, Amy. "
Howard,Who’s Dave?
Howard,Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
Howard,"Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?"
Howard,"Oh, no, not this again."
Howard,"Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?"
Howard,May I say something?
Howard,Never mind.
Howard,"Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died."
Howard,I’m listening.
Howard,That is reasonable. But what room?
Howard,"No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom."
Howard,I want to change my answer.
Howard,I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
Howard,Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
Howard,Hey. What’s going on?
Howard,Your dad’s on your side.
Howard,"Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing."
Howard,When is your visa up?
Howard,"Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell."
Howard,Oh.
Howard,Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
Howard,"Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room."
Howard,Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?
Howard,"That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids."
Howard,"I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…"
Howard,"Oh, my God, we’re gonna die."
Howard,That would be nice.
Howard,But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
Howard,Why are you still here?
Howard,"All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different."
Howard,"Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there."
Howard,"And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?"
Howard,I really believe I’d be a great dad.
Howard,"Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
Howard,No problem.
Howard,You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.
Howard,Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.
Howard,But what are you looking for?
Howard,Isn’t that a little unreasonable?
Howard,I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
Howard,"If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?"
Howard,You seriously think women would fight for you?
Howard,"He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes."
Howard,"Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist."
Howard,"I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."
Howard,"Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment."
Howard,"Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize."
Howard,Congratulations.
Howard,Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
Howard,"Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night."
Howard,"And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
Howard,I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
Howard,What?
Howard,You thought she was great in X-Men.
Howard,Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
Howard,Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
Howard,"It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty."
Howard,No. How does it work?
Howard,"So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
Howard,"Oh. Cool.  Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
Howard,"Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too."
Howard,"If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?"
Howard,"Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long."
Howard,I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
Howard,Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
Howard,Wipe that smug smile off your face.
Howard,So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
Howard,"I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more."
Howard,It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.
Howard,"All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad."
Howard,We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
Howard,Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
Howard,"Huh. Okay, I’ll try it."
Howard,"No fair, I was meditating."
Howard,Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
Howard,"Y, you’re Elon Musk."
Howard,"Wh, what are you doing here?"
Howard,"Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech."
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer."
Howard,"Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me."
Howard,"Oh. I made my wife come down, too."
Howard,Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do."
Howard,Really? Why?
Howard,"Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?"
Howard,Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
Howard,"That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo."
Howard,"All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together."
Howard,We did raise the roof that night.
Howard,Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
Howard,What should we write?
Howard,Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
Howard,"Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’."
Howard,I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.
Howard,"So, who is this guy?"
Howard,Cool name.
Howard,"Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment."
Howard,Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
Howard,"Oh, he’s our fan."
Howard,"Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band."
Howard,And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
Howard,Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
Howard,"After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle."
Howard,"So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy."
Howard,No. Let him spot us.
Howard,"Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
Howard,I can’t watch.
Howard,Why is he looking at it?
Howard,"Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah."
Howard,Let’s just go.
Howard,Nope.
Howard,They’re not supposed to be available yet.
Howard,Same here!
Howard,What are we gonna do?!
Howard,Got ’em.
Howard,"Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  "
Howard,"It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
Howard,"Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?"
Howard,Ready to go?
Howard,I know.
Howard,T minus 15 minutes.
Howard,Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it.
Howard,He’s right.
Howard,I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this.
Howard,He’s right.
Howard,Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
Howard,Hi.
Howard,What kind of doctor is she?
Howard,"Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her."
Howard,Social anxiety.
Howard,Fear of failure.
Howard,Spineless.
Howard,That was incredible.
Howard,I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
Howard,"What is it, Stuart?"
Howard,Hang on. Should I send him away?
Howard,What’s up?
Howard,Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
Howard,What?
Howard,"You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
Howard,No one.
Howard,Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
Howard,He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.
Howard,"No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?"
Howard,"Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave."
Howard,"As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
Howard,"Well, what do you think we should do?"
Howard,Oh. He was so excited.
Howard,I’ll give it to him next time I see him.
Howard,No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
Howard,Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
Howard,Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
Howard,That was pretty cute.
Howard,I can’t believe I miss Stuart.
Howard,I don’t know.
Howard,Glad to hear it.
Howard,"Hey, she came all the way here…"
Howard,He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.
Howard,"You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship."
Howard,We should all take a trip or something.
Howard,Bernie would love that.
Howard,No.
Howard,No.
Howard,Wow. I’m impressed.
Howard,Apology accepted.
Howard,Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
Howard,"Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option."
Howard,"Ooh, check out the stripper pole."
Howard,"That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?"
Howard,"I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar."
Howard,"Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned."
Howard,"Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago."
Howard,You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
Howard,You should. He’s really looked.
Howard,Hi.
Howard,You’re a screenwriter?
Howard,"He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it."
Howard,What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
Howard,"So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
Howard,Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?
Howard,You weren’t there. He was really flirting.
Howard,Really? So it’s okay if I fl…
Howard,No. Never.
Howard,What?
Howard,"Fine. I had reservations about you, too."
Howard,"No, I didn’t."
Howard,"Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose."
Howard,"Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily."
Howard,"And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke."
Howard,When are you gonna tell Emily?
Howard,Hello.
Howard,"Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean."
Howard,Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
Howard,You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?
Howard,No.
Howard,I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
Howard,"Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in."
Howard,"You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?"
Howard,How?
Howard,"Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen."
Howard,"Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer."
Howard,"I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much."
Howard,"Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?"
Howard,"Well, how do we do that?"
Howard,"Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check."
Howard,"To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah."
Howard,You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
Howard,He is. Should we name him?
Howard,"Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me."
Howard,"No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies."
Howard,"Poor judgement, obviously."
Howard,How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
Howard,"It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely."
Howard,"It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me."
Howard,"Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
Howard,He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howard,"No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
Howard,Morning.
Howard,We? What is this?
Howard,"Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more."
Howard,Are you serious?
Howard,Are you sure?
Howard,"Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall."
Howard,"It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before."
Howard,"But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid."
Howard,"Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket."
Howard,"How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny."
Howard,"Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something."
Howard,"I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father."
Howard,I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.
Howard,"And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?"
Howard,"Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?"
Howard,"A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now."
Howard,This isn’t a joke.
Howard,"You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now."
Howard,"Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants."
Howard,"If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money."
Howard,That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
Howard,"Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas."
Howard,"I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
Howard,"Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
Howard,"Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?"
Howard,"Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?"
Howard,"And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence."
Howard,You think so?
Howard,I’m not finding anything either.
Howard,Damn. What is it?
Howard,"If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
Howard,Maybe you’re right.
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?
Howard,I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.
Howard,"Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it."
Howard,I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
Howard,"I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.  Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me."
Howard,"Thank you, Pasadena. Good night."
Howard,You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?
Howard,That’s funny. Let’s do that.
Howard,Don’t say that to him.
Howard,"Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman."
Howard,Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?
Howard,"Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…"
Howard,"Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend."
Howard,What? You gotta be kidding me?
Howard,"Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?"
Howard,Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
Howard,"See, he’s not wearing a tie."
Howard,Excellent.
Howard,"Oh, I don’t think there will be."
Howard,Can you imagine if we make money with this?
Howard,"That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose."
Howard,Seventy-five percent?
Howard,"Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?"
Howard,"Come on, let’s go."
Howard,"We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with."
Howard,"Either way, I get nothing."
Howard,I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
Howard,"Okay, great."
Howard,"You can do it, Sheldon."
Howard,This contract looks good to me.
Howard,"Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract."
Howard,"Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
Howard,"Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out."
Howard,"Honey, this is fine."
Howard,Can I talk to you in the hall?
Howard,Excuse us.
Howard,What are you doing?
Howard,What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.
Howard,"All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself."
Howard,Here we go with the ironclad logic again.
Howard,Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership."
Howard,"Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me."
Howard,See? This is what happens every time we work together.
Howard,I’m on board.
Howard,"Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
Howard,"All right, let’s sign this."
Howard,I should’ve known.
Howard,"That’s very generous, Sheldon."
Howard,I appreciate that.
Howard,Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
Howard,"There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
Howard,"While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape."
Howard,I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
Howard,"What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder."
Howard,You want to come with us?
Howard,Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
Howard,"Well, hang on. What movie is it?"
Howard,Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.
Howard,"Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?"
Howard,It’s not a problem.
Howard,And now you’ve made it a problem.
Howard,But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
Howard,"Well, I lie a lot."
Howard,"Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
Howard,Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
Howard,I know. I want to make him feel bad.
Howard,Hi.
Howard,"We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
Howard,Yeah. Anywhere you want.
Howard,What is he doing in there?
Howard,You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
Howard,Ready for dinner?
Howard,"Hey, where you been?"
Howard,"Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?"
Howard,I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
Howard,Really?
Howard,"Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet."
Howard,And it just got weird.
Howard,What the hell are you watching?
Howard,"Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?"
Howard,"All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?"
Howard,Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?
Howard,So he can be part of the experience?
Howard,I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
Howard,Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.
Howard,So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
Howard,"And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?"
Howard,Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
Howard,Astronauts saw him carrying that.
Howard,"Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
Howard,But we have to set some boundaries.
Howard,The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.
Howard,"Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off."
Howard,Thanks for understanding.
Howard,You need some help?
Howard,I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
Howard,"But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little."
Howard,What? Are you gonna cry?
Howard,Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
Howard,I’ll go get him.
Howard,"No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here."
Howard,"Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat."
Howard,"Hey, look at that. It’s weird again."
Howard,"All right, here we go."
Howard,"Well, give me a second."
Howard,"Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?"
Howard,We did.
Howard,You didn’t.
Howard,But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.
Howard,So does that answer your question?
Howard,"I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
Howard,I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
Howard,You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
Howard,I guess I am lucky.
Howard,You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
Howard,"I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are."
Howard,There you go again.
Howard,"Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
Howard,"Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
Howard,Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
Howard,"No, I’m fine."
Howard,Just drop it.
Howard,"Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?"
Howard,"Wait, what is going on?"
Howard,As long as I don’t have to watch with him.
Howard,Why do you get to pick?
Howard,Don’t tell me where to go.
Howard,And I’m gonna eat it all.
Howard,So what the hell happened?
Howard,"Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too."
Howard,Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,"Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on."
Howard,I don’t know. I like the pain of others.
Howard,"No, she doesn’t."
Howard,She does not.
Howard,"Well, she did. And human resources."
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Howard,"Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?"
Howard,Well just a feeling.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
Howard,‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.
Howard,"Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on."
Howard,You sure?
Howard,I bet you’d like a drink right now.
Howard,Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.
Howard,"Actually, it’s making me dizzy."
Howard,Hey. Where is everybody?
Howard,Oh. Cool.
Howard,"You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are."
Howard,I know. What are they gonna talk about?
Howard,"Oh, good."
Howard,"No, two minutes."
Howard,Where’s Claire?
Howard,Really? Nothing?
Howard,"Yeah, hey, buddy."
Howard,We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
Howard,"Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
Howard,"Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems."
Howard,"You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever."
Howard,"Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons."
Howard,A lot.
Howard,"Me, too."
Howard,Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.
Howard,Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.
Howard,But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
Howard,"Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world."
Howard,Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
Howard,You got something better?
Howard,"Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?"
Howard,Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
Howard,Let’s do it.
Howard,"In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?"
Howard,"If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
Howard,Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
Howard,"We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?"
Howard,Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
Howard,You look like you come with a kickstand.
Howard,"Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?"
Howard,I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
Howard,Five.
Howard,"Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know."
Howard,We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.
Howard,"I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair."
Howard,"Oh, my God. It’s working."
Howard,"Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation."
Howard,Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.
Howard,"Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force."
Howard,"Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird."
Howard,I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
Howard,I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
Howard,"Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho."
Howard,"Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over."
Howard,"I’m sorry, you find this funny?"
Howard,"I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?"
Howard,"One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it."
Howard,It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
Howard,"You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us."
Howard,Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
Howard,"I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam."
Howard,"Oh, God. I think someone’s following us."
Howard,"I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail."
Howard,I told you.
Howard,He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?
Howard,Hang on.
Howard,"I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me."
Howard,Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
Howard,"Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay."
Howard,I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
Howard,"That’s great, now they know where I live."
Howard,Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
Howard,"All right, all right."
Howard,"Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams."
Howard,"Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?"
Howard,Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
Howard,That’s really stupid advice.
Howard,"Calm down, try not to think about it."
Howard,Why do I bother talking to you?
Howard,"I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?"
Howard,What’s the point of that story?
Howard,At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
Howard,The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
Howard,"And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially."
Howard,I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.
Howard,"Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?"
Howard,"Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
Howard,"You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
Howard,"Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?"
Howard,And my cousin’s a lawyer.
Howard,Give me a second to call my cousin.
Howard,"First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy."
Howard,"Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us."
Howard,"Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system."
Howard,"And this is my friend, Raj."
Howard,"Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?"
Howard,"Marty, let me call you back."
Howard,No.
Howard,Hello.
Howard,"It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
Howard,Really? You’re a physicist?
Howard,"Oh. Well, hey, me, too."
Howard,"Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
Howard,I’m not even sure that’s possible.
Howard,Four months?
Howard,"Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
Howard,I love your French toast.
Howard,We didn’t. Sheldon did.
Howard,"No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay."
Howard,Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.
Howard,You are a deeply silly man.
Howard,Maybe that’s because it’s classified.
Howard,I guess this is it. 
Howard,Let’s find out.
Howard,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
Howard,It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
Howard,What?
Howard,"Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere."
Howard,"Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights."
Howard,"Well, I don’t know, midnight, one."
Howard,"If you’re tired, have some coffee."
Howard,I am having coffee.
Howard,Sorry I have to work all weekend.
Howard,Thanks again for breakfast.
Howard,Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
Howard,You wanted him awake.
Howard,Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
Howard,Why don’t you just go home?
Howard,You can’t develop a problem that fast.
Howard,"Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
Howard,No worries.
Howard,That was painful to watch.
Howard,No.
Howard,"When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
Howard,We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.
Howard,"We, we’re thinking, two years."
Howard,That’s it? You’re okay with that?
Howard,"Yes, thank you so much."
Howard,Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
Howard,"Yeah, we could name him Blobert."
Howard,Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
Howard,"Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing."
Howard,Mm.
Howard,"So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?"
Howard,It’s unbelievable.
Howard,I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
Howard,But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
Howard,"But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da."
Howard,Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.
Howard,But you just said you wanted to know.
Howard,Call you back.
Howard,"Okay, you’re positive you want to know?"
Howard,Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.
Howard,Wrong number.
Howard,As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.
Howard,"Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Howard,"Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Howard,"Honey, how ya feeling?  So that’s good news, right?"
Howard,"There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
Howard,I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.
Howard,How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home. 
Howard,Does it sound sexy?
Howard,You bet I did.
Howard,You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.
Howard,"Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?"
Howard,"It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house."
Howard,We should call the police.
Howard,"Damn, so did I."
Howard,"What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?"
Howard,You know I rely on humour in times of stress.
Howard,Is that the hot tub?
Howard,"Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
Howard,Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
Howard,"Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
Howard,"Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings."
Howard,Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
Howard,"Well, clearly, I lied."
Howard,He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
Howard,"Those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
Howard,"It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know."
Howard,You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
Howard,That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.
Howard,I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.
Howard,"Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
Howard,"Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
Howard,Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
Howard,Are we even in a good school…? Ow!
Howard,Hi.
Howard,"Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
Howard,You’re gonna love it.
Howard,"Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety. "
Howard,"But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it."
Howard,"In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?"
Howard,"It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
Howard,The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore. 
Howard,"It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future."
Howard,"Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?"
Howard,You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
Howard,"Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
Howard,Yes.
Howard,"See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room."
Howard,Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
Howard,"You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
Howard,You’re right. It sells itself.
Howard,"If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?"
Howard,Why is it taking so long?
Howard,"I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one."
Howard,"Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags."
Howard,"Oh, right. "
Howard,"Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny."
Howard,"I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us."
Howard,"Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
Howard,"You heard him, guys, don’t ask."
Howard,And how single are you right now?
Howard,"Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face."
Howard,So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
Howard,"So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?"
Howard,I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
Howard,"See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
Howard,"It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv "
Howard,"You’re up, blabby."
Howard,"You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything."
Howard,"Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?"
Howard,This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
Howard,"Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
Howard,"No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
Howard,"Oh, did you meet her at work?"
Howard,"So, when do we meet her?"
Howard,"Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?"
Howard,Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,"Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper."
Howard,"I can keep this, right?"
Howard,"Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart."
Howard,"Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant."
Howard,Ah.
Howard,"And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
Howard,Here he comes.
Howard,Do you?
Howard,That’s amazing.
Howard,You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
Howard,"Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking."
Howard,I found him in an old box.
Howard,I didn’t buy it. I made it.
Howard,What’s the big deal?
Howard,"No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff."
Howard,His eyes also light up in the dark.
Howard,"Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it."
Howard,"You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it."
Howard,I have no problem calling him.
Howard,"Fine, I will."
Howard,You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
Howard,I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
Howard,Do you think this is in poor taste?
Howard,Yeah
Howard,What do you think?
Howard,"All right, we’re done. It’s offensive."
Howard,You’re in a good mood.
Howard,What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
Howard,And I think you’re cute.
Howard,"This is very nice Stuart, thank you."
Howard,"Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
Howard,When would you move in?
Howard,"Yeah, let him do it."
Howard,How did you know it wasn’t me?
Howard,It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.
Howard,"It’s pajamas, there’s no cape."
Howard,That’d be great.
Howard,Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
Howard,"Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
Howard,Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
Howard,"Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
Howard,"Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
Howard,"Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan."
Howard,I love you.
Howard,"Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?"
Howard,"Stop that, this isn’t India."
Howard,Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
Howard,I’m the father.
Howard,No idea. Ask him.
Howard,"No, we’re keeping it a surprise."
Howard,And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
Howard,"All right, enough with the camera."
Howard,"I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?"
Howard,"We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it."
Howard,"Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little."
Howard,"Deep breaths, slow breaths."
Howard,"Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back."
Howard,"So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz."
Howard,Debbie? No. She hated that name.
Howard,Melvina.
Howard,Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.
Howard,Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.
Howard,Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.
Howard,"Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today."
Howard,"Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class."
Howard,Do you want me to get the nurse?
Howard,"She’s here, the baby’s here."
Howard,"Tired, but great. They’re both great."
Howard,We have named her Halley.
Howard,"Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
Howard,"I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
Howard,Of course.
Howard,"Hey, guys."
Howard,"The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?"
Howard,"No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me."
Howard,What did we miss?
Howard,So what did you and Leonard do?
Howard,What happened 
Howard,"Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies."
Howard,"Hey, he got her to stop."
Howard,What’s the matter?
Howard,"Oh, good."
Howard,"I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away."
Howard,It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
Howard,"She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that."
Howard,"Shh, I don’t hate you. "
Howard,Bernie?
Howard,Great. And where are you?
Howard,Oh. This is new.
Howard,"Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on."
Howard,Do you need help getting out?
Howard,Is it okay if I get some sleep?
Howard,"Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you."
Howard,Good night. I love both my girls.
Howard,"Not me, paternity leave."
Howard,"With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this."
Howard,"All right, got Halley to sleep. "
Howard,"Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
Howard,"Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help."
Howard,Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
Howard,"Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug. "
Howard,That sounds expensive.
Howard,"MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
Howard,No.
Howard,No.
Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
Howard,"Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
Howard,Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
Howard,"Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it."
Howard,Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
Howard,"It’s a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
Howard,"So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,"
Howard,"Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea."
Howard,"Bigger problems, I felt something pop. "
Howard,I thought things were going well. What happened?
Howard,Sometimes people say things they don’t mean.
Howard,Because that’s not what people do.
Howard,"You if it’s at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype."
Howard,"Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. They’re sending a prototype for you to beta test."
Howard,"Well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
Howard,"Yeah, I was joking."
Howard,This thing’s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
Howard,The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.
Howard,"Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you’re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?"
Howard,Try another one.
Howard,"Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?"
Howard,You’re so stupid.
Howard,"No, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
Howard,"Hey, you went out with him. I didn’t."
Howard,Like this one?
Howard,Schmuck. Got it.
Howard,"Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed."
Howard,"Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?"
Howard,"Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne."
Howard,"Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that’s very brave."
Howard,"Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette."
Howard,"Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
Howard,Don’t beat yourself up. That’s what I’m here for.
Howard,"Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no."
Howard,"Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go."
Howard,Too late. Stuart called dibs.
Howard,I don’t know. What difference does it make?
Howard,Those do look fun.
Howard,"If you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?"
Howard,I’m not gonna get fat.
Howard,"Fine. Look, I’ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way."
Howard,Okay. How about if I eat like this?
Howard,"Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
Howard,"Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you’re gonna melt."
Howard,"Okay, I’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
Howard,"Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things."
Howard,Those are just the things I say out loud.
Howard,What’s wrong?
Howard,Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller. 
Howard,"Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home."
Howard,I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.
Howard,"I don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
Howard,"We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him."
Howard,It’s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?
Howard,Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
Howard,But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations. 
Howard,"Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought."
Howard,The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
Howard,I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Howard,"I don’t know, but if he yells It’s alive, we run."
Howard,How’d you even get that up the stairs?
Howard,Open a window. It’s about to get smug in here.
Howard,He’s worried about looking foolish. That’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.
Howard,All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.
Howard,Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
Howard,"Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven’t pitched anything."
Howard,You really figured it out?
Howard,"Oh, you’re a genius."
Howard,That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard.
Howard,It’s a manifold.
Howard,Told ya. Can you fix it for us?
Howard,"But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know."
Howard,"And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store."
Howard,That’s a turbo.
Howard,"Go. Come on, Raj."
Howard,We’re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Howard,"Yeah, we’re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it."
Howard,"Yes, he is."
Howard,"Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks."
Howard,"Come on, Raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it."
Howard,And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Howard,"Oh, no, now we have two."
Howard,Maybe your dad’s right.
Howard,You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary.
Howard,"Well, how much do you spend on food?"
Howard,"What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?"
Howard,"We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless."
Howard,Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
Howard,Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Howard,That’s understandable.
Howard,I thought your dad paid your cards.
Howard,What if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?
Howard,"Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks."
Howard,You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?
Howard,And hate all the crowds at the panels.
Howard,Why don’t you just tell her not to come?
Howard,What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?
Howard,"Yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you."
Howard,So?
Howard,"Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?"
Howard,What you doing?
Howard,"Oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. I’m such a lucky guy."
Howard,"No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
Howard,"Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it’s not a big deal."
Howard,"Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go. "
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,What? Why? 
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Yeah.
Howard,Hey.
Howard,They complete my ensemble. What do you want?
Howard,"Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?"
Howard,I tried.
Howard,There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
Howard,"I know, I wish there was some way we could help him."
Howard,"Yeah, that’s working out great for me."
Howard,"Dinner’s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
Howard,Sure. This is for you.
Howard,There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.
Howard,"You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family."
Howard,I’m gonna go check on dinner.
Howard,"Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India."
Howard,"Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?"
Howard,You want to let him live here?
Howard,"I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
Howard,"Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
Howard,"Let’s hope he thinks so, too."
Howard,"Hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you."
Howard,"I know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
Howard,"It is our pleasure.  Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?"
Howard,"Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
Howard,"Yeah. We barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours."
Howard,What?
Howard,I don’t know. Why are you asking all these questions?
Howard,Great. Go live there.
Howard,"I just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
Howard,It was really no problem.
Howard,"Hey, look at that. You’ve got a Raj, we’ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
Howard,He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to.
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,I’ll say it again. India.
Howard,Never should’ve had all these kids so close together.
Howard,"If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here."
Howard,"Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it."
Howard,"I’m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?"
Howard,"Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting."
Howard,"Well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
Howard,Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.
Howard,This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.
Howard,You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.
Howard,You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to.
Howard,Wait. What? What do I make you do?
Howard,"It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It’s not my fault you didn’t listen."
Howard,"Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
Howard,"Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
Howard,"Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
Howard,You can just feel the time being saved.
Howard,The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.
Howard,"Seven? Look at the board, it’s four."
Howard,Four.
Howard,"Son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
Howard,"Hey, what’s for dinner?"
Howard,"Oh, cool."
Howard,"Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
Howard,"Speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
Howard,You okay?
Howard,"Well, I don’t know, you seem a little upset."
Howard,You sure?
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"Look, something’s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?"
Howard,"Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?"
Howard,"Well, I know she’s mad at me about something."
Howard,"Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
Howard,"Hmm, let’s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie’s great-aunt, Trixie, died. "
Howard,And I forgot to give her the message.
Howard,"The terrible part is, ever since then, I’ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie."
Howard,"Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse."
Howard,"Hey, how’s it going?"
Howard,Good. Love you.
Howard,Love you more. 
Howard,"Sure, sorry. "
Howard,"No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
Howard,"Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
Howard,"Aha, you are upset. I don’t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them."
Howard,It doesn’t?
Howard,"Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back."
Howard,Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.
Howard,"Look, I don’t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
Howard,"And the best part is Halley won’t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they’re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I’m gone, then magically I’m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
Howard,"Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don’t need food as long as I can look at my phone."
Howard,You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
Howard,This is supposed to be our family fun day. What’s so important on your phone?
Howard,Stop looking at that. The day care’s great. It’s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There’s nothing to worry about.
Howard,She already likes soap bubbles more than us.
Howard,They’re highly-trained educators with background checks. They’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.
Howard,How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
Howard,Learning anything?
Howard,"Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
Howard,What are you making?
Howard,Finally get Halley down?
Howard,"Look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out."
Howard,"I mean, why would you say that?"
Howard,I guess. It wasn’t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
Howard,Have a great first day back.
Howard,"I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
Howard,"Great, now everybody’s crying."
Howard,That’s good.
Howard,She’s great. Look.
Howard,See? Nothing to worry about.
Howard,"Yeah, me, too. Love you."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet.
Howard,Probably. We should go.
Howard,"I’ll get her, you grab her bag. "
Howard,It’s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid’s foot.
Howard,Guess who’s home from the aquarium?
Howard,She does look happy.
Howard,We can’t get through.
Howard,"Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button."
Howard,"Okay, challenge them again."
Howard,"No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks."
Howard,Kids are always better at video games.
Howard,"Oh, so our love is not real?"
Howard,"Now, this is rare. I don’t know which one of you I want to stop talking first."
Howard,"Boy, it is neck and neck right now."
Howard,"All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?"
Howard,"Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic."
Howard,"Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?"
Howard,"And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?"
Howard,"Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling."
Howard,"No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
Howard,No.
Howard,So you told her she was being dumb?
Howard,"I don’t know, maybe."
Howard,"Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
Howard,Again.
Howard,"You know what? I’m with Leonard, this isn’t cool."
Howard,I went to see your mom.
Howard,"I just told you, your mom’s."
Howard,"Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
Howard,"She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot.  Hi, Bernadette, remember me?"
Howard,I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.
Howard,"Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
Howard,Which is?
Howard,"Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling."
Howard,"All right, very funny."
Howard,"That’s enough, put her away."
Howard,"All right, you’re freaking me out."
Howard,"Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
Howard,What the hell?
Howard,But the movie did just get good.
Howard,But why would you do that?
Howard,This is all very upsetting.
Howard,How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
Howard,"Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny."
Howard,They wouldn’t say.
Howard,Give us some good news.
Howard,Not really.
Howard,"No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted."
Howard,"Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world. "
Howard,"I’m happy about it, but, I mean, it’s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
Howard,"Hey, wait up."
Howard,You left something at home. A big hug.
Howard,I found it right next to these kisses.
Howard,I missed you.
Howard,Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.
Howard,Oh.
Howard,I know and I’m sorry.
Howard,"Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?"
Howard,"Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
Howard,So?
Howard,And now the movie just got rated R.
Howard,How’s Sheldon doing with Amy gone?
Howard,"If you’d like, we can help you out."
Howard,"I mean, not me, I’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram."
Howard,A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
Howard,Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.
Howard,"Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
Howard,That ain’t Sheldon.
Howard,It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.
Howard,Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?
Howard,She’s not that kind of doctor.
Howard,"Great. Anybody’s better than, mmm."
Howard,"We should call Guinness, that might be a record."
Howard,You done trying to make yourself feel better?
Howard,"Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me."
Howard,"No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna sausages."
Howard,"Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served. "
Howard,"Oh boy, I was afraid of this."
Howard,"Good point, how you gonna cool it?"
Howard,"I think Mrs Tishman’s got her eye on you. I’ve been there, you’re in for a treat. "
Howard,"Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you’re new in town. "
Howard,"Ola, nerd-migos. "
Howard, Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,We can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
Howard,"Ladies, ladies, I’m sure there’s a middle ground."
Howard,"You girl’s talk, I’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin. "
Howard,"Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless. "
Howard,You won’t believe this.
Howard,"Oh boy, group hug."
Howard,"No, I’m lost too, I think she skipped a step. "
Howard,"Howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour? "
Howard,Told you the sensor would work. 
Howard,I’ll talk to you later. 
Howard,Is he here? 
Howard,I agree.
Howard,If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon. 
Howard,If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon. 
Howard,"Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. "
Howard,What are you so happy about?
Howard,Make sure they remember no peanuts.
Howard,What if guests show up?
Howard,Hey!
Howard,"Penny, look, I’ve got a problem."
Howard,"Hey, qu’est q’wass up?"
Howard,"No, that’s what she said, Sheldon."
Howard,"Hello, boys."
Howard,"Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard."
Howard,"Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard."
Howard,"Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant."
Howard,"We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!"
Howard,I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
Howard,I know. It’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
Howard,I got your text. How bad is… Oy.
Howard,"Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…"
Howard,It’s hot in here. It must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
Howard,"Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?"
Howard,"Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings."
Howard,Someone’s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
Howard,"You’re right, that’s a great idea."
Howard,"Enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. I’ll come over every night and have dinner with you."
Howard,"Okay, I get it, you’re angry. You don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest."
Howard,"Fine, I’ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!"
Howard,"Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now."
Howard,He says they didn’t do it.
Howard,"Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away."
Howard,"Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great."
Howard,"What’s going on, day dwellers?"
Howard,"Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
Howard,What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.
Howard,"Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
Howard,"Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother."
Howard,"Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa."
Howard,Testing. Check. Check two.
Howard,"…Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!"
Howard,"What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette."
Howard,Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
Howard,How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
Howard,"Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too."
Howard,"You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together."
Howard,Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?
Howard,I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
Howard,"No, no, no. He won. Suck it up."
Howard,"Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette."
Howard,Why can’t you get it?
Howard,"I don’t care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I’m not reading it."
Howard,He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.
Howard,"Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman."
Howard,Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
Howard,Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
Howard,"Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you."
Howard,"No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!"
Howard,What ya thinking so hard about?
Howard,"Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her."
Howard,I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
Howard,"Bernie, you okay?"
Howard,"Okay, the Eagle has landed."
Howard,I’ll get it!
Howard,I said I’m getting it!
Howard,"Emily, this is our friend Raj."
Howard,"I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
Howard,"Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you."
Howard,"Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring."
Howard,He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
Howard,I’ll tell you later.
Howard,"Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
Howard,How about now?
Howard,Hi.
Howard,Hi.
Howard,You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
Howard,"Oh, hi."
Howard,Oy vay!
Howard,"Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz"
Howard,Dr. Schneider?
Howard,"Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it."
Howard,"Come on, guys. Let’s do this."
Howard,Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.
Howard,"Hey, what’s up?"
Howard,"Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent."
Howard,Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
Howard,"If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS."
Howard,"Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
Howard,What do you want?
Howard,"All I do is win, win, win no matter what."
Howard,"Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!"
Howard,Why are you being so bossy?
Howard,"I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?"
Howard,"Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye."
Howard,Can I help you?
Howard,"All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow."
Howard,"We will, we will percussive shock you."
Howard,"Indy’ whip snapped, Thor’s hammer missed."
Howard,"Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’."
Howard,"I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question."
Howard,"Raj, who’s at the door?"
Howard,"All right, we got a problem."
Howard,Wanna see a movie?
Howard,For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
Howard,That’s Raj.
Howard,"I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents."
Howard,"Oh, wow. Don’t let him get away."
Howard,Kind of busy.
Howard,Wondering how it all began?
Howard,For information and entertainment.
Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I’m just a little concerned about you."
Leonard,"Okay, maybe later."
Howard,Hey.
Howard,"I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too."
Leonard,"This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet."
Leonard,Can we please stop saying coitus?
Leonard,"He’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest. "
Leonard,"Agreed, what’s your point?"
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti. "
Leonard,"Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
Leonard,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
Leonard,"What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
Leonard,I’m sure she’ll still love him.
Leonard,"Well, what do you want to do?"
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,See you.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Not really.
Leonard,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Leonard,New neighbour?
Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
Leonard,"Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
Leonard,"Leonard, Sheldon."
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
Leonard,"Oh, great."
Leonard,"Great. Well, bye."
Leonard,Bye. 
Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
Leonard,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
Leonard,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
Leonard,"Yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
Leonard,I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.
Leonard,"Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
Leonard,Hi. Again.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
Leonard,"Uh, yes."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,"Okay, well, make yourself at home."
Leonard,You’re very welcome.
Leonard,"I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
Leonard,In what universe?
Leonard,Here we go.
Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
Leonard,"Sheldon, sit!"
Leonard,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.
Leonard,"Yes I now, but…"
Leonard,"Yes, I remember."
Leonard,I’m sorry.
Leonard,I said I’m sorry.
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
Leonard,"I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
Leonard,"Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
Leonard,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
Leonard,"I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea."
Leonard,So it’s based on your life?
Leonard,"Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
Leonard,Don’t.
Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
Leonard,"No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse."
Leonard,Our shower works.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,It’s right down the hall.
Leonard,How so?
Leonard,"That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode."
Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
Leonard,"What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?"
Leonard,"I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
Leonard,That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
Leonard,It’s Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.
Leonard,See what?
Leonard,This is not a good time.
Leonard,"That’s great, you guys have to go."
Leonard,It’s just not a good time.
Leonard,"No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,I’m not anticipating coitus.
Leonard,"Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower."
Leonard,"Save it for your blog, Howard."
Leonard,"Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry."
Leonard,"You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…."
Leonard,The hair products are Sheldon’s.
Leonard,"A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you."
Leonard,"Oh, I’ll probably say yes."
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,Must we?
Leonard,"She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon."
Leonard,Which is?
Leonard,That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
Leonard,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
Leonard,"Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim."
Leonard,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
Leonard,"No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him."
Leonard,"Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
Leonard,"What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV."
Leonard,We’re not going to give up just like that.
Leonard,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
Leonard,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
Leonard,Just grab the door.
Leonard,This is it.  I’ll do the talking.
Leonard,"I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
Leonard,Oh. We’re scientists.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I’m sorry.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this."
Leonard,"And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex."
Leonard,"Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone."
Leonard,"Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend."
Leonard,We’re home.
Leonard,"Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
Leonard,"No, it was a valid hypothesis."
Leonard,Really? Great.
Leonard,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Leonard,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
Leonard,"There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts."
Leonard,"Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."
Leonard,Here we go.
Leonard,"Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I’ll get it."
Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"They’re not going anywhere.  So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work."
Leonard,"So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?"
Leonard,"Yeah, no problem."
Leonard,"Penny, wait."
Leonard,"Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
Leonard,"Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength."
Leonard,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells."
Leonard,"Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves."
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter…  I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this."
Leonard,Do you have any ideas?
Leonard,"Easy, easy  Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. "
Leonard,"What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
Leonard,Men do things for women without expecting sex.
Leonard,"I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds."
Leonard,"Almost there, almost there, almost there. "
Leonard,You okay?
Leonard,So Penny’s a little messy.
Leonard,"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
Leonard,"Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
Leonard,"Come on, we should go."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not your home."
Leonard,"When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place."
Leonard,What were you doing in his closet?
Leonard,"Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Well, we’ll get out of your hair."
Leonard,It’s a joke.
Leonard,"Yeah, he didn’t tell it right."
Leonard,Sheldon?
Leonard,Sheldon? Hello? 
Leonard,Sheldon!
Leonard,"Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
Leonard,"Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
Leonard,"No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to get out of here."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,That’s ridiculous. 
Leonard,O-o-o-oh! .
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
Leonard,Morning. 
Leonard,I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
Leonard,You think?
Leonard,"You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
Leonard,"Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth."
Leonard,"No, I do not have a sarcasm sign."
Leonard,Penny’s up.
Leonard,How did she know it was us?
Leonard,"God, this is going to be bad."
Leonard,"Yes, but, only to clean."
Leonard,"I’m very, very sorry."
Leonard,"Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
Leonard,"Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
Leonard,"Sure, that’s another way to go."
Leonard,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What’s funny?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,It’s fine. You win.
Leonard,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,"Um, here’s the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research…."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Six two inch dowels.
Leonard,"One package, Phillips head screws."
Leonard,"No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering. "
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
Leonard,And control it how?
Leonard,"Also inefficient, and might be loud."
Leonard,"Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
Leonard,"Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium. "
Leonard,Meet back here in an hour?
Leonard,Got it. .
Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
Leonard,"Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
Leonard,Stay in formation.
Leonard,"That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off."
Leonard,"Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
Leonard,"Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj."
Leonard,"Dammit man, we’re dying here. "
Leonard,The bastard teleported. 
Leonard,"You betrayed us for money, who are you?"
Leonard,"No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right now."
Leonard,Excuse me.
Leonard,"Oh, right, right right right right."
Leonard,Not much. Bro. 
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here."
Leonard,"Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. "
Leonard,"No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! ."
Leonard,"No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
Leonard,What is wrong with you?
Leonard,"No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with."
Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
Leonard,"Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
Leonard,I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
Leonard,Hello Lesley.
Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
Leonard,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
Leonard,"Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. "
Leonard,"I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology. "
Leonard,"There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. "
Leonard,"Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. "
Leonard,"You mean, kiss you now?"
Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Leonard,Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
Leonard,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
Leonard,None?
Leonard,"Ah. Well, thank you for your time."
Leonard,None at all?
Leonard,"Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. "
Leonard,"I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. "
Leonard,"I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. "
Leonard,"Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat."
Leonard,"It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me. "
Leonard,"You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask her out."
Leonard,"No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out. "
Leonard,"Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
Leonard,"There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper."
Leonard,"Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
Leonard,Really? Great!
Leonard,Us guys?
Leonard,"They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu."
Leonard,Great. Did we say a time?
Leonard,And that’s still good for you.
Leonard,Cos it’s not carved in stone.
Leonard,I’ll get my chisel.
Leonard,"To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty."
Leonard,How do I look?
Leonard,Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?
Leonard,Six thirty. 
Leonard,Is it too much?
Leonard,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. "
Leonard,"No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea. "
Leonard,"You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
Leonard,You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
Leonard,"I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!"
Leonard,I’m having a panic attack.
Leonard,"If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack."
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.
Leonard,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
Leonard,Give me the phone. 
Leonard,I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
Leonard,"Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet. "
Leonard,"You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common. "
Leonard,We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
Leonard,Nothing.
Leonard,"Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
Leonard,What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?
Leonard,"Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend."
Leonard,"No,  You were saying, but…"
Leonard,Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back. 
Leonard,"Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex."
Leonard,"I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer."
Leonard,"Well, chafing, right?"
Leonard,"Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. "
Leonard,Physics. .
Leonard,"Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. "
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?"
Leonard,I’m not okay.
Leonard,"No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding."
Leonard,"Yes, but I get car sick too, so…"
Leonard,"Sorry about your car, by the way."
Leonard,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
Leonard,"When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night. "
Leonard,Awesome!
Leonard,"Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
Leonard,Interesting.
Leonard,"Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? "
Leonard,Then I guess congratulations are in order.
Leonard,"I know, I’m familiar with you."
Leonard,"Yes, I was there."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. "
Leonard,Mahalo’s a nice touch. 
Leonard,"Interesting, you should lead with that."
Leonard,You don’t have buffets in India?
Leonard,What.  Howard brought a date?
Leonard,"Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Leonard,Morning
Leonard,You’re making eggs for breakfast?
Leonard,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
Leonard,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
Leonard,"You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back."
Leonard,Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
Leonard,And we all thank you.
Leonard,What’s with the fish?
Leonard,What happened to your scrambled egg research?
Leonard,So… fish. 
Leonard,Fish nightlights.
Leonard,"Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back."
Leonard,Like luminous fish.
Leonard,Right… I didn’t….
Leonard,Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Leonard,"I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one. "
Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. 
Leonard,"Really, when was the last time you left the house."
Leonard,That was three weeks ago.
Leonard,Where are you going?
Leonard,Oh. 
Leonard,I see.
Leonard,Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
Leonard,"That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"
Leonard,Sounds like a wise man.
Leonard,A death ray?
Leonard,"No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends."
Leonard,"This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. "
Leonard,Really? That’s impressive.
Leonard,"Hey, how did it go?"
Leonard,Really? What happened?
Leonard,That narrows it down. 
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk."
Leonard,And Orcs!
Leonard,"Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
Leonard,I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger. 
Leonard,Make it two. 
Leonard,Hey Lesley. 
Leonard,"Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. "
Leonard,Lesley and I do research together at the University. 
Leonard,What happened to Elliot Wong?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure, why not."
Leonard,Why at my place?
Leonard,"Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough. "
Leonard,"Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
Leonard,"What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
Leonard,"If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. "
Leonard,How so?
Leonard,"Well, what do you think."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. "
Leonard,"Uh, sure, why not. "
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,I thought you weren’t interested in me.
Leonard,You mean my cello?
Leonard,No kidding?
Leonard,"Gee, uh…"
Leonard,Penny? What about her?
Leonard,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up. "
Leonard,"No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me."
Leonard,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. "
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. 
Leonard,"I’m good, I’m good to go. "
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
Leonard,"Thank you, I’ll see you at work. "
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,Pretty good. 
Leonard,"Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
Leonard,Sheldon!
Leonard,"Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go! "
Leonard,"Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
Leonard,"You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent."
Leonard,She fixed your equation.
Leonard,You don’t believe in luck.
Leonard,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. "
Leonard,Yeah. 
Leonard,"Hey, Lesley."
Leonard,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
Leonard,So anyway  Hello.
Leonard,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
Leonard,"I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt. "
Leonard,Who wouldn’t? 
Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Leonard,You want to make plans for New Years.
Leonard,Doctor what?
Leonard,Wha… how did it get on the internet?
Leonard,"Well, how did you know about it?"
Leonard,"Well, that part’s true! "
Leonard,No kidding.
Leonard,Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. 
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out. "
Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? 
Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
Leonard,"Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. . "
Leonard,"Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
Leonard,"I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go."
Leonard,"You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
Leonard,Hello Penny.
Leonard,A party? 
Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…"
Leonard,We’re really more….
Leonard,"But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
Leonard,Is there a theme?
Leonard,"He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…"
Leonard,"Oh, no. "
Leonard,"We all have other costumes, we can change."
Leonard,"Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?"
Leonard,I call Frodo!
Leonard,You went with Thor?
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
Leonard,"No, it’s not…"
Leonard,"Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. "
Leonard,"For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. "
Leonard,All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork. 
Leonard,"Hey, sorry we’re late. "
Leonard,"Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…"
Leonard,"Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect."
Leonard,Okay. 
Leonard,We’re socialising. Meeting new people. 
Leonard,"She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat."
Leonard,Where do you get this stuff?
Leonard,"I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people. "
Leonard,How so?
Leonard,Go on.
Leonard,Then what happens?
Leonard,"This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in."
Leonard,"No, you’re coming with me."
Leonard,Come on.
Leonard,Yes. But I need a wing-man.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
Leonard,Because I’m Frodo.
Leonard,Oh no.
Leonard,That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
Leonard,"If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him."
Leonard,"Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. ."
Leonard,Maybe they just want to be friends. 
Leonard,Then he and I are on equal ground.
Leonard,"Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
Leonard,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down. "
Leonard,No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face. 
Leonard,Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
Leonard,"No, I’m a Hobbit."
Leonard,"Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. "
Leonard,I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
Leonard,"Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery. "
Leonard,"No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. "
Leonard,"No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
Leonard,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
Leonard,I think I’ve made my point.
Leonard,"There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…."
Leonard,What’s that?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
Leonard,Hi Penny.
Leonard,I’m fine. 
Leonard,It’s not your fault.
Leonard,So why was he at your party?
Leonard,There there. 
Leonard,"Nothing, you’re perfect."
Leonard,Yes you are. 
Leonard,Penny?
Leonard,How much have you had to drink tonight?
Leonard,"Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius. "
Leonard,"Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. "
Leonard,Probably. 
Leonard,"That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. "
Leonard,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. "
Leonard,So? We’ll start now.
Leonard,Sure. What’s going on.
Leonard,"So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay? "
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore."
Leonard,"Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back. "
Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
Leonard,Great idea.
Leonard,It’s the only way we can play teams. 
Leonard,"Penny, you are on fire."
Leonard,"Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. "
Leonard,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
Leonard,I guess for you that’s an option.
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,"She’s an enigma, Raj. "
Leonard,"She’s gone, Sheldon. "
Leonard,What’s wrong?
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. "
Leonard,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
Leonard,"It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice. "
Leonard,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? "
Leonard,So? 
Leonard,"I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
Leonard,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. "
Leonard,I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow. 
Leonard,Here you go.
Leonard,Sorry about that.
Leonard,"FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. "
Leonard,"Well, sleep tight."
Leonard,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight. "
Leonard,What are you doing? 
Leonard,Penny’s still sleeping.
Leonard,"I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed? "
Leonard,Almost 6:30. 
Leonard,"Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning."
Leonard,Leonard. 
Leonard,"Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
Leonard,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
Leonard,"Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
Leonard,We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
Leonard,I see a problem. 
Leonard,"So, we’ll just order three entrees."
Leonard,"Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
Leonard,"This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction. "
Leonard,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four. "
Leonard,"If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
Leonard,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
Leonard,We don’t order egg rolls.
Leonard,"Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food."
Leonard,"Yeah, we can always divide soup."
Leonard,"Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie, "
Leonard,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. 
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. "
Leonard,"No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
Leonard,Who are you calling?
Leonard,"Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
Leonard,"You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. "
Leonard,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
Leonard,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
Leonard,"There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher. "
Leonard,I thought I heard something. 
Leonard,"No, never mind, alright, go. "
Leonard,Problem?
Leonard,"Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,Hi! 
Leonard,"Yeah, we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!"
Leonard,"Actually, I read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in India. "
Leonard,I bet you’re right.
Leonard,"I’m not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show. "
Leonard,What? 
Leonard,"Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer. "
Leonard,"Hey, I thought you were finding new friends."
Leonard,So don’t call her.
Leonard,So call her. 
Leonard,"I’m done, anybody else?"
Leonard,"Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. "
Leonard,"Oh, hey. "
Leonard,His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?
Leonard,"Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
Leonard,"Look, Penny, we’d love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn’t drink, so…  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking. "
Leonard,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you. 
Leonard,Whatever you recommend.
Leonard,It’s amazing.
Leonard,Um… Raj.
Leonard,"Wait a minute, what’s the plan here? Let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.
Leonard,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
Leonard,Beats the hell out of me. 
Leonard,"Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely Raj’s fault. "
Leonard,"No, I’m Leonard. "
Leonard,You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to each other. 
Leonard,"Take it, Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten. "
Leonard,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
Leonard,So you’re not going to see her again?
Leonard,I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren. 
Leonard,"I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him? "
Leonard,You didn’t?
Leonard,"Okay, the X10s are online."
Leonard,"Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
Leonard,"No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access. "
Leonard,"No, hang on, hang on.  See! "
Leonard,"Wireless webcams, wave hello. "
Leonard,Who’s running the red Corvette?
Leonard,"Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? "
Leonard,It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates. 
Leonard,"Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
Leonard,Forget the parties.
Leonard,Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Leonard,"Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this."
Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it."
Leonard,"Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. "
Leonard,So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
Leonard,"Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings. "
Leonard,You forbid it?
Leonard,"Oh, you admit that it’s our work."
Leonard,Ah!
Leonard,"Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”"
Leonard,"They don’t, that’s why I saved this one. "
Leonard,Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,"Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor. "
Leonard,"You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. "
Leonard,It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
Leonard,"Great, be right back."
Leonard,Here?
Leonard,"No, I’m not shy."
Leonard,"I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
Leonard,Putting them on.
Leonard,"No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. "
Leonard,"Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit. "
Leonard,"Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit. "
Leonard,"Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. "
Leonard,"Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two. "
Leonard,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. 
Leonard,My last growth spurt. 
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,What… . 
Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving for the conference. "
Leonard,Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.
Leonard,"I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…"
Leonard,"No, no not at all. A little bit. "
Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
Leonard,Let’s go.
Leonard,"You’re right, this side does look better. "
Leonard,You’re kidding. 
Leonard,"All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock. "
Leonard,"I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous. "
Leonard,"A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right? "
Leonard,"It’s a classic, right? "
Leonard,"So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Are there any questions?"
Leonard,Any other questions?
Leonard,"I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science."
Leonard,You are not Isaac Newton.
Leonard,You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
Leonard,"Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
Leonard,"Really, so why did you come?"
Leonard,I didn’t screw it up.
Leonard,"I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
Leonard,"Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse."
Leonard,You cannot blow up my head with your mind. 
Leonard,You were trying to blow up my head.
Leonard,"It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase."
Leonard,"Stop, stop it, quit it. "
Leonard,You’re lucky I didn’t run you over. 
Leonard,"You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs help. "
Leonard,Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
Leonard,What? 
Leonard,Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
Leonard,"See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2."
Leonard,Skynet is kinky? I don’t know. 
Leonard,"Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…"
Leonard,What the hell is that? 
Leonard,What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and 
Leonard,"Oh, I give up."
Leonard,"Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?"
Leonard,No you don’t. No he doesn’t.
Leonard,"Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
Leonard,No you don’t. He doesn’t.
Leonard,"Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
Leonard,"No, it’s this Friday, at eight. "
Leonard,See you.  
Leonard,"Yes, I did. "
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
Leonard,That’s very true. 
Leonard,What?
Leonard,It’s two o’clock in the morning
Leonard,I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there? 
Leonard,"Sheldon, what is it? "
Leonard,What was I supposed to say. 
Leonard,That would have hurt her feelings. 
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,And what would I have said afterwards? 
Leonard,"I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again. "
Leonard,"It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. "
Leonard,Well now you are.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?
Leonard,How?
Leonard,"You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help."
Leonard,"Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling. "
Leonard,Your cousin Leopold?
Leonard,What’s important?
Leonard,Do you have a cousin Leopold.
Leonard,"I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
Leonard,Un-unravelable?
Leonard,"Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
Leonard,We’re going to Long Beach?
Leonard,"Oh, come on!"
Leonard,So he goes back into rehab?
Leonard,You still told her I lied.
Leonard,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
Leonard,"So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach? "
Leonard,"Oh, well, thankyou."
Leonard,I don’t know what to say. 
Leonard,"Oh, okay, alright, good. "
Leonard,"Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re"
Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
Leonard,"Howard, listen…"
Leonard,Well… I don’t know what to say. 
Leonard,"Oh, another hug, thank you."
Leonard,Thanks Penny. 
Leonard,"No, we’re not going to Long Beach."
Leonard,Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold. 
Leonard,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? "
Leonard,"Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. "
Leonard,"What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over. "
Leonard,Why not? 
Leonard,"There is no Leo, how can you say that? "
Leonard,I’ve got a solution.
Leonard,Get out.
Leonard,Who are you? 
Leonard,"Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
Leonard,Sheldon?
Leonard,"Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?"
Leonard,Oh…!
Leonard,"Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?"
Leonard,There were only two people there?
Leonard,"As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy."
Leonard,Sounds good.
Leonard,"Gee, why wouldn’t I?"
Leonard,Yeah! Funny how things work out. 
Leonard,How long is he going to stay here.
Leonard,O-o-o-o-h! Again?
Leonard,Just reset the board.
Leonard,Hey! 
Leonard,"Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?"
Leonard,How was your family?
Leonard,Here we go. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s not contagious."
Leonard,"Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe. "
Leonard,You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. 
Leonard,No problem. Welcome home. 
Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
Leonard,With lime jello?
Leonard,I don’t think so.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting? "
Leonard,I’m going back to bed. 
Leonard,What for? 
Leonard,I mix pancake batter in this! 
Leonard,"You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? "
Leonard,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. 
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,They asked me to come in.
Leonard,They texted me. 
Leonard,No kidding?
Leonard,"Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. "
Leonard,Drink whatever you want.
Leonard,Then make soup. 
Leonard,"I’m at work, Sheldon.  "
Leonard,"Yes, "
Leonard,"Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go. "
Leonard,"Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green. "
Leonard,"Affirmative, with fever."
Leonard,"Howard, listen to me."
Leonard,I tried to stop you. 
Leonard,"You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. "
Leonard,"Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start. "
Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny!"
Leonard,I’m… uh… at work.
Leonard,I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny.  I feel really guilty. "
Leonard,"Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
Leonard,Oh great.
Leonard,"Yeah, at home. "
Leonard,You want me to get eye surgery? 
Leonard,I’m thinking! 
Leonard,"What do you see, what do you see."
Leonard,"Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. "
Leonard,Raj?
Leonard,"Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything. "
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,Won’t my footsteps set it off? 
Leonard,"Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?"
Leonard,What? 
Leonard,Then just say go straight. 
Leonard,Alright  I just hit my head. 
Leonard,It wasn’t on? 
Leonard,Then why did I have to crawl? 
Leonard,"Okay, it’s on."
Leonard,I know. 
Leonard,Hi!
Leonard,"Well, I had to, you see what he’s like. "
Leonard,No! 
Leonard,W-wait! 
Leonard,Wait! Penny! Take me with you!  
Leonard,I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again. 
Leonard,"Yeah, so?"
Leonard,"If I stand, I’ll vomit. "
Leonard,Lay it on me. 
Leonard,How about that. 
Leonard,Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? 
Leonard,That is a problem. 
Leonard,"Graduate work, very impressive."
Leonard,Advantage Kim. 
Leonard,Yes sir. 
Leonard,"So, Dennis, how long have you been in America."
Leonard,"No kidding, you speak English really well."
Leonard,What are you talking about? 
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything."
Leonard,"Huh, yeah? "
Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment."
Leonard,Not heavy ones. 
Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab."
Leonard,"It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it? "
Leonard,Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
Leonard,"Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better. "
Leonard,You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
Leonard,"Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,Great. 
Leonard,"Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help. "
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,It would blow up.
Leonard,Pretty sure.
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. "
Leonard,Go away.
Leonard,"If he were, I wouldn’t be. "
Leonard,Is that even possible?
Leonard,Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. 
Leonard,"Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no. "
Leonard,"That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Howard, he’s fifteen."
Leonard,"Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. "
Leonard,It’s take your daughter to work day. 
Leonard,"Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. "
Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
Leonard,Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  
Leonard,"No, we can’t. "
Leonard,"Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. "
Leonard,"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you. "
Leonard,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her. 
Leonard,"I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. "
Leonard,"Well, we’re not in India. "
Leonard,"Okay, that was uncalled for."
Leonard,The kid got a girl. 
Leonard,"Yeah, mission accomplished. "
Leonard,"Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart. "
Leonard,"I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”"
Leonard,"Yeah, we really ruined his life. "
Leonard,"Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive."
Leonard,What did you spill on it?
Leonard,I’ll take a look at it. 
Leonard,"You’re kidding, why not?"
Leonard,"This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. "
Leonard,"Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you."
Leonard,The needs of the many.
Leonard,The ladies?
Leonard,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? 
Leonard,"After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
Leonard,"I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
Leonard,"I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start. "
Leonard,I knew that too.
Leonard,Just ask another one.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. "
Leonard,"Howard, sit down."
Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
Leonard,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
Leonard,Why do they say AA? 
Leonard,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. 
Leonard,"No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
Leonard,"Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team. "
Leonard,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. "
Leonard,"Yes we did, I just came from it."
Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team. "
Leonard,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. "
Leonard,Thanks for the heads up. 
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. "
Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go? 
Leonard,"Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
Leonard,"So nothing, let’s destroy him. "
Leonard,"Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team. "
Leonard,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
Leonard,Yes. 
Leonard,"Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
Leonard,"Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…"
Leonard,"There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. "
Leonard,"That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now."
Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
Leonard,She’s in. 
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing. "
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,"So, is that your team."
Leonard,Here’s your tee-shirt.  
Leonard,"No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. "
Leonard,The Eta Meson.
Leonard,Prevost’s theory of exchanges. 
Leonard,What the hell is that.
Leonard,"Come on, think, Leslie."
Leonard,"You’re never going to let that go, are you? "
Leonard,"Sorry, I panicked. "
Leonard,"Um, eight.  Point four. "
Leonard,"Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. "
Leonard,Go ahead.
Leonard,"Sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy! 
Leonard,I know someone who would disagree.
Leonard,"My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”"
Leonard,"You’re right, I’m sorry.  I’m not! "
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Bring it on.
Leonard,How do you know these things?
Leonard,"Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner."
Leonard,I don’t believe it.
Leonard,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. 
Leonard,"No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice. "
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,Yeah. And that’s my bid.
Leonard,"It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. "
Leonard,Not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
Leonard,"Come on, snipers. "
Leonard,Where are your snipers?
Leonard,Snipe.
Leonard,Snipe. 
Leonard,Snipe!
Leonard,SNIPE!
Leonard,Aaaa-aw! 
Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it. "
Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs? 
Leonard,Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years. 
Leonard,"Come on, guys, push. "
Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs. "
Leonard,"It’s… you know, time machine. "
Leonard,"Uh, just give us a few minutes."
Leonard,"Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind. "
Leonard,"Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
Leonard,Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. 
Leonard,Seconded. 
Leonard,That sounds fair.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. "
Leonard,"So, when it’s your turn you can."
Leonard,"Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun. "
Leonard,Are you okay?
Leonard,That doesn’t sound too bad.
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,"The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
Leonard,So?
Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now? 
Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer. 
Leonard,What was your first clue?
Leonard,Yes I’m upset. 
Leonard,"Yeah, good for you. "
Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
Leonard,"Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. "
Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
Leonard,Those are movies.
Leonard,"Come on, guys, push. "
Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine. "
Leonard,No problem. 
Leonard,Some things are more important than toys. 
Leonard,"Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you."
Leonard,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. 
Leonard,It’s not about money.
Leonard,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
Leonard,Because I don’t want it any more. 
Leonard,Just… personal reasons. 
Leonard,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
Leonard,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it. "
Leonard,Not for long.
Leonard,"It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. "
Leonard,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
Leonard,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
Leonard,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
Leonard,"Sheldon, get out of my way."
Leonard,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it. "
Leonard,"No, I needed to hear it."
Leonard,"Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life. "
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…"
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you okay? "
Leonard,"It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
Leonard,"I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. "
Leonard,"On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it. "
Leonard,"I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  What’s going on?"
Leonard,Sheldon’s office? Is she lost? 
Leonard,Maybe she’s his lawyer.
Leonard,Howard…
Leonard,"Oh, hey buddy. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you going to introduce us? "
Leonard,"You too, swell, also."
Leonard,"So, how do you two know each other."
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,"So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas? "
Leonard,"If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight? "
Leonard,"Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room."
Leonard,So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.
Leonard,"Hee-hee, just classic. "
Leonard,Those are not mine.
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny."
Leonard,I wasn’t staring! 
Leonard,"Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect. "
Leonard,I brought snacks.
Leonard,"Onion dip, it’s onion dip. "
Leonard,We don’t entertain much. 
Leonard,"Bye Missy, see you."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny."
Leonard,"Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister."
Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
Leonard,"Hell, no! "
Leonard,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
Leonard,Thank you. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
Leonard,"That’s fascinating, but I…"
Leonard,"Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister. "
Leonard,"That’s great, but I…."
Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
Leonard,Because she’s your sister. 
Leonard,"Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate. "
Leonard,Uh-huh. 
Leonard,"Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring. "
Leonard,"He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
Leonard,Say what?
Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. "
Leonard,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time. 
Leonard,Sit down.
Leonard,"If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way."
Leonard,And he’s down!
Leonard,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
Leonard,Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. 
Leonard,"Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
Leonard,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? "
Leonard,"Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
Leonard,"Oh. You have other plans, or…?"
Leonard,Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
Leonard,"Oh, it’s called trestling."
Leonard,"Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? "
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think so."
Leonard,I don’t celebrate my birthday.
Leonard,"No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
Leonard,"Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.  "
Leonard,"Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
Leonard,"Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
Leonard,Hey. 
Leonard,Fine. 
Leonard,Seen it.
Leonard,Oh. Pass. 
Leonard,"Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7."
Leonard,Not if you believe his doctors. 
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.  Come on, come on, oh you clever little…. Come on, come on, take that! "
Leonard,What’s the matter?
Leonard,"Oh my God, why did you eat it?"
Leonard,"Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? "
Leonard,Now?
Leonard,"Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
Leonard,"Really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. "
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"Alright, I’ll be right back. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
Leonard,Yes he is.
Leonard,"Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. "
Leonard,"You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. "
Leonard,"There is a party, isn’t there."
Leonard,Howard. 
Leonard,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
Leonard,Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party. 
Leonard,"Oh, it’s okay."
Leonard,"Hey Penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?"
Leonard,Why are you learning Chinese?
Leonard,"If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken. "
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. "
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,"Penny, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…."
Leonard,"Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn’t want to talk. "
Leonard,"It was Penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up."
Leonard,"You know what, I’m going to go back and try talking to her again."
Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Howard."
Leonard,What about “damsel in distress?”
Leonard,"I don’t care. She’s upset, I’m going over there. "
Leonard,"I’m her friend, I’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
Leonard,I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend. 
Leonard,"Wait, did you say wait?"
Leonard,No. No. 
Leonard,Of course not.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, what were the choices again? "
Leonard,"Yeah, no, sure."
Leonard,Actually it’s not all that easy to find. 
Leonard,"Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind. "
Leonard,"Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. "
Leonard,"Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? "
Leonard,Doesn’t that violate the health code?
Leonard,Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. 
Leonard,Maybe a little.
Leonard,"No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
Leonard,"Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. "
Leonard,"What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal. "
Leonard,I’m pretty sure I never said that. 
Leonard,"Aw, good for me. Where are you going?"
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. "
Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
Leonard,Just roll the dice. 
Leonard,"She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"
Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken. 
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I know that part. "
Leonard,"Already, that was quick."
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I am so sorry."
Leonard,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that. "
Leonard,"Yeah, that must get old quick. "
Leonard,What about me?
Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
Leonard,Um… yes… I am… asking you out. 
Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
Leonard,Yes what? 
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Yeah. That’s the spirit. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake. "
Leonard,"No, it’s about Penny."
Leonard,I don’t think I can go out with her tonight. 
Leonard,Other people would say “why not?” 
Leonard,I’m going to talk anyway.
Leonard,"Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny, I’m not excited, I’m nauseous. "
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. "
Leonard,You’re not helping. 
Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
Leonard,"Wow, that’s brilliant."
Leonard,Hi. 
Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
Leonard,I made an eight o’clock reservation.
Leonard,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat? "
Leonard,Good.  
Leonard,"So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. "
Leonard,It’s also not pink and has no berries.
Leonard,What was your question again?
Leonard,"Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant."
Leonard,"So, gas."
Leonard,"Well, good night. "
Leonard,There was a draft.
Leonard,Why don’t we just go into your….
Leonard,"No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast. "
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R."
Leonard,That might work too. 
Leonard,Goodnight.  
Leonard,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
Leonard,"What are you talking about, the date went fine. "
Leonard,"Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.” "
Leonard,I’m not the fish. 
Leonard,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it. "
Leonard,"Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. "
Leonard,I didn’t say anything like that.
Leonard,"Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. "
Leonard,That’s not a bad sign.
Leonard,"I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. "
Leonard,You could be Batman?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. "
Leonard,What about Saturday?
Leonard,"Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"
Leonard,No I didn’t.
Leonard,What’s going on with you?
Leonard,What’s wrong with your face? 
Leonard,What? 
Leonard,Good day? 
Leonard,"What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why? "
Leonard,"Yeah, there kind of does."
Leonard,I’m still confused.
Leonard,"It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out. "
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No. 
Leonard,"I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
Leonard,That was fast. 
Leonard,Where are you gonna live? 
Leonard,This could work. 
Leonard,I’m coming! 
Leonard,What’s with him?
Leonard,I still don’t know why you left.
Leonard,Why not.
Leonard,You promised Penny what? 
Leonard,What secret. Tell me the secret. 
Leonard,"Not that secret, the other secret."
Leonard,"Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
Leonard,I promise. 
Leonard,So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem? 
Leonard,"Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous. "
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. "
Leonard,"First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. "
Leonard,"Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.  "
Leonard,"A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal. "
Leonard,"Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college. "
Leonard,That doesn’t matter to me at all.
Leonard,Absolutely.  Oh bite me! 
Leonard,"Please let it go, Sheldon."
Leonard,You’re nitpicking.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"So, yeah, good to see you."
Leonard,"It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on."
Leonard,"Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
Leonard,"Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?"
Leonard,You went out and bought linen?
Leonard,Borrowed?
Leonard,"You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself."
Leonard,Of course. Out of respect.
Leonard,"What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle."
Leonard,"Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?"
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,What happened to you?
Leonard,"Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
Leonard,"Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable."
Leonard,"Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
Leonard,How?
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Leonard,"Uh, sure."
Leonard,Where did you hear that?
Leonard,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
Leonard,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
Leonard,"Really, what changed?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?"
Leonard,"Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?"
Leonard,Sounds fun.
Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very thoughtful."
Leonard,Terrific.
Leonard,I kind of have other plans tonight.
Leonard,"Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over."
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over."
Leonard,"Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?"
Leonard,"Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
Leonard,"You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s from Changs."
Leonard,"No, Changs."
Leonard,It changed.
Leonard,A little.
Leonard,I sure hope so.
Leonard,"Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?"
Leonard,"Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
Leonard,"Well, I think tonight was a very good start."
Leonard,"No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,"Okay, well, goodnight. "
Leonard,Right 
Leonard,"Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us."
Leonard,Don’t make this hard for me.
Leonard,"You’re right, it is simple. "
Leonard,"If the word is pee-pee, just do it."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful."
Leonard,"Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy."
Leonard,"Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal."
Leonard,I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
Leonard,"Wait, where are you going?"
Leonard,What’s the bright side?
Leonard,Oh yeah.
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?"
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,"Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
Leonard,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
Leonard,Want to catch me up?
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?"
Leonard,"Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water."
Leonard,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
Leonard,"No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic."
Leonard,"Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming."
Leonard,Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
Leonard,"You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?"
Leonard,I’ll go talk to her.
Leonard,"Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?"
Leonard,"It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny."
Leonard,"Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
Leonard,"Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
Leonard,"Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair."
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,Penny’s been keeping him up at night.
Leonard,"She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop."
Leonard,"Sheldon, wake up."
Leonard,"That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
Leonard,"Leslie, you are way off base here."
Leonard,"Excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
Leonard,Sheldon…
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
Leonard,Chosen by science?
Leonard,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
Leonard,This is bad.
Leonard,"Really, really bad."
Leonard,They never do.
Leonard,"Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."
Leonard,Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
Leonard,"Penny, you don’t have to do that."
Leonard,"Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen."
Leonard,You’d do the dolphins.
Leonard,Are you proud of yourself?
Leonard,"Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner."
Leonard,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive."
Leonard,"Really, do tell."
Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?"
Leonard,Come on.
Leonard,"Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension."
Leonard,"And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him."
Leonard,Smile. 
Leonard,"We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman."
Leonard,"Close enough, come on.  Hi Raj."
Leonard,Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?  
Leonard,Dr Gablehauser.
Leonard,Sheldon!
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,You can stop smiling now.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Not yet.
Leonard,You just got him this afternoon.
Leonard,A lackey?
Leonard,Almost.
Leonard,"Well, uh, no I… the… no."
Leonard,Now. 
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,You look very nice.
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Terrific.
Leonard,Anythingforagreencard.com?
Leonard,You’re joking.
Leonard,Pass.
Leonard,"It’s not a date, and that’s racist."
Leonard,Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,You’re welcome.
Leonard,Just sit down and eat.
Leonard,"Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?"
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
Leonard,Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
Leonard,"He’s irony impaired, just move on."
Leonard,A griffin?
Leonard,And mythological.
Leonard,You want to breed a new friend?
Leonard,"That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
Leonard,"If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back."
Leonard,"Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man."
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,I’m not going to work.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements."
Leonard,And?
Leonard,"Goodnight, Sheldon."
Leonard,Take the bus.
Leonard,You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Leonard,"Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out."
Leonard,I just got here.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks."
Leonard,"Howard, help me out here."
Leonard,How did you get here in the first place?
Leonard,"Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
Leonard,"Sheldon, sit down."
Leonard,"So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
Leonard,"Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed."
Leonard,"Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
Leonard,Booting.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
Leonard,"Okay, fasten your seat belt."
Leonard,You don’t need air bags.
Leonard,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,Watch out.
Leonard,"Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
Leonard,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
Leonard,Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
Leonard,"Aw, the pet store?"
Leonard,"So wait,you’re just gonna give up?"
Leonard,So what is it you’re doing?
Leonard,What does that mean?
Leonard,"I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that."
Leonard,No kidding.
Leonard,"Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!"
Leonard,It’s never safe.
Leonard,"Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
Leonard,"Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"No, he lives here now."
Leonard,"Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment."
Leonard,Yep
Leonard,"So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?"
Leonard,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
Leonard,"If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store."
Leonard,"Oh, good God."
Leonard,"Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?"
Leonard,"No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Leonard,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
Leonard,"Hey, Ramona. Come on in."
Leonard,"Uh, the kitchen’s fine.  Hey, what are you doing?"
Leonard,"Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. No, we were just going."
Leonard,"No, come on, now, we’re going out."
Leonard,"Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is."
Leonard,What do you mean “deal”?
Leonard,"Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
Leonard,"On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
Leonard,"Hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
Leonard,Uh…
Leonard,The one with the little onions? Mmm.
Leonard,Don’t.
Leonard,"Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?"
Leonard,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
Leonard,"So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?"
Leonard,Touche.
Leonard,"Ah, hey Leslie."
Leonard,Wait for me.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny."
Leonard,Why? What are they doing?
Leonard,"Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?"
Leonard,Seriously? You’re not coming?
Leonard,"Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is."
Leonard,Sheldon?  What are you doing?!
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,We are communicating through the wall.
Leonard,I don’t know Morse code.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!"
Leonard,"Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t  Aw! What’s going on?"
Leonard,I know. When is she going home?
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
Leonard,Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
Leonard,That’s it. No more Thai food.
Leonard,"Okay, I have pokh."
Leonard,Potl.
Leonard,Pukhpa.
Leonard,Really? Define it.
Leonard,"No, no, don’t tell her."
Leonard,Aw!
Leonard,They’re gorgeous.
Leonard,"Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz."
Leonard,Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
Leonard,"Sheldon, the food’s here."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I asked.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Just eat.
Leonard,Here you go.
Leonard,Put it on the agenda.
Leonard,"Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it."
Leonard,Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
Leonard,"No, no, no,  no, I don’t think that’s where it was."
Leonard,Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
Leonard,Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him."
Leonard,"Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him."
Leonard,"Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!"
Leonard,To do what?
Leonard,"Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi."
Leonard,"Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line."
Leonard,"Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?"
Leonard,"Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say."
Leonard,We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
Leonard,"Well, actually, technically, you did do it."
Leonard,You can recognize people on Google Earth?
Leonard,NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
Leonard,Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
Leonard,Problem with the WiFi?
Leonard,"I reiterate, knuckle under."
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."
Leonard,"There, see? Problem solved."
Leonard,"Thanks a lot, Howard."
Leonard,"Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?"
Leonard,"Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?"
Leonard,"No. Look, this has to stop."
Leonard,"All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here."
Leonard,Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
Leonard,He can never know that I gave that to you.
Leonard,It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
Leonard,"Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy."
Leonard,Your mother.
Leonard,Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
Leonard,Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
Leonard,"Well, five is partway between three… Never mind."
Leonard,"Ahoy, matey."
Leonard,"Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
Leonard,"You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic."
Leonard,"Well, I want to watch it now."
Leonard,Watch whatever you want.
Leonard,Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,How can 5 not be worse than 1?
Leonard,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
Leonard,What’s the emergency?
Leonard,"Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,No one’s a scientist like Howard.
Leonard,"Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
Leonard,"Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
Leonard,Then why did you?
Leonard,"Got it. So, can I see you again?"
Leonard,Ooh. Cool.
Leonard,Psst! Psst!
Leonard,"Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while."
Leonard,"No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know."
Leonard,I can’t tell you that.
Leonard,"I can’t tell you that, either."
Leonard,"Yeah, I really didn’t think this through."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Just say, Leonard went to the office."
Leonard,"What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office."
Leonard,I’m going to the office.
Leonard,I’m going out for a while.
Leonard,So how was work today?
Leonard,I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
Leonard,"Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff."
Leonard,"Well, I wrote some of it down."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Leonard,"If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole."
Leonard,I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
Leonard,"That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed."
Leonard,Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
Leonard,"Dear God, no!"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Yeah, a couple."
Leonard, Thank you.
Leonard,I’m sorry?
Leonard,"So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
Leonard,"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him."
Leonard,"Oh, she’s a doctor."
Leonard,"Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
Leonard,On what?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,Does that change things?
Leonard,So why’d you ask?
Leonard,"Listen, I need to talk to you about something."
Leonard,"Oh, hey, guys."
Leonard,"Hi, Howard. Howard?"
Leonard,That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
Leonard,"Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen."
Leonard,"Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…"
Leonard,He just won’t listen to me.
Leonard,Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
Leonard,"Howard, Howard, look at this."
Leonard,I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
Leonard,I stand corrected.
Leonard,She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
Leonard,"Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?"
Leonard,What landing party?
Leonard,"Oh, my god, what did you do?"
Leonard,Oo-oo-oh!
Leonard,What invitation?
Leonard,"Oh, clearly I could have."
Leonard,Not the right seats. 
Leonard,He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
Leonard,Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
Leonard,"No, just sit here."
Leonard,"What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?"
Leonard,The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
Leonard,Stephanie Barnett is single.
Leonard,It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie."
Leonard,"General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation."
Leonard,Because this is not Star Trek
Leonard,"All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?"
Leonard,Want some more wine?
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
Leonard,By making constipated moose sounds?
Leonard,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
Leonard,"Oh, for god’s sakes."
Leonard,"No, no, no, I got it."
Leonard,"No, I’m not. I’m bleeding."
Leonard,Stitches? With a needle?
Leonard,"Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. "
Leonard,I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
Leonard,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
Leonard,She stuck a needle into my hand!
Leonard,I didn’t cry.
Leonard,"Oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
Leonard,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper."
Leonard,"Hey, can you open this for me?"
Leonard,Sure. .
Leonard,What for?
Leonard,"What? no. no, that’s not right."
Leonard,"It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status."
Leonard,You hacked my facebook account?
Leonard,Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
Leonard,Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
Leonard,"Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend."
Leonard,"Me, too."
Leonard,"No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
Leonard,Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
Leonard,"Okay, I’ll be right in."
Leonard,Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,"No, you’re not."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,We’re not living together.
Leonard,That’s absurd.
Leonard,"Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers."
Leonard,I’m going to bed.
Leonard,"No, absolutely not."
Leonard,"I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
Leonard,"Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that."
Leonard,"She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!"
Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian."
Leonard,"She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…"
Leonard,"Okay, bye-bye."
Leonard,Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
Leonard,We’re not living together.
Leonard,We’re not living together.
Leonard,How could I not be sure?
Leonard,Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
Leonard,We’re not living together.
Leonard,We’re not living together.
Leonard,"Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!"
Leonard,We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
Leonard,"I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together."
Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got them for me."
Leonard,"Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend."
Leonard,"It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together."
Leonard,At least I have an egg. What do you have?
Leonard,"So, go hit on her."
Leonard,"I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?"
Leonard,"No, the pants that Stephanie got me."
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,"Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner."
Leonard,"No, everything’s fine."
Leonard,"Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
Leonard,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
Leonard,No that doesn’t sound right either.
Leonard,"Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you."
Leonard,You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
Leonard,"No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Sheldon.  What’s going on?
Leonard,"Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse."
Leonard,"Listen, we need to talk."
Leonard,I don’t know what that means.
Leonard,"Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
Leonard,It’s just a little scary.
Leonard,"Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?"
Leonard,"Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!"
Leonard,What’s that? Really? Right now?
Leonard,"I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
Leonard,"Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Good.
Leonard,"Well, um, on one level, really, really well."
Leonard,"Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings."
Leonard,"And then the, the subject got changed somehow."
Leonard,"Um, little bit.  What?"
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Huh.
Leonard,"Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me."
Leonard,"Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?"
Leonard,"I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?"
Leonard,"Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you."
Leonard,What speech?
Leonard,"No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you."
Leonard,Terrific.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
Leonard,Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
Leonard,Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
Leonard,"Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya."
Leonard,"Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian."
Leonard,It’s David Underhill. So what?
Leonard,"I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop."
Leonard,Did not.
Leonard,"Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Leonard,"Uh, y-yeah."
Leonard,You want to work with me?
Leonard,"Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…"
Leonard,"Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan."
Leonard,Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
Leonard,"Actually, I was…"
Leonard,"Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it."
Leonard,I was working with Dave Underhill.
Leonard,"Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
Leonard,"No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box."
Leonard,"He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps."
Leonard,Ow! Ow!
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
Leonard,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
Leonard,"I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident."
Leonard,I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
Leonard,"Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
Leonard,I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
Leonard,"Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
Leonard,Since when?
Leonard,Since when?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. I guess."
Leonard,"Yeah, if you like that type."
Leonard,"No, just neighbours."
Leonard,"Actually, science is my lady."
Leonard,"See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun. "
Leonard,"What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga."
Leonard,Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
Leonard,"Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself."
Leonard,"That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
Leonard,Yippee.
Leonard,Brilliant.
Leonard,Do whatever you want.
Leonard,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
Leonard,"Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?"
Leonard,"Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool."
Leonard,Really? Why would you say that?
Leonard,He tried to take nude photos of you?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible."
Leonard,"Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!"
Leonard,Lactose.
Leonard,Smooth.
Leonard,"Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one."
Leonard,"By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
Leonard,Merry Christmas.
Leonard,"Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in."
Leonard,"Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful."
Leonard,"Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you."
Leonard,"You know, ’cause you’re so into science."
Leonard,It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
Leonard,Maybe we should start small.
Leonard,How about the toaster oven?
Leonard,"What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time."
Leonard,That’ll do it.
Leonard,Uh-huh?
Leonard,Killer robot. We built it.
Leonard,"Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
Leonard,"I’m begging you, stop talking."
Leonard,"Howard, where you going?"
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
Leonard,"I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him."
Leonard,"Yes, we did, Kripke."
Leonard,"Come on, is that really necessary?"
Leonard,"No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Leonard,I need you to apologize to How…
Leonard,Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
Leonard,The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
Leonard,He’s been in bed for two days.
Leonard,He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
Leonard,"Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
Leonard,"You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
Leonard,"Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him."
Leonard,"Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
Leonard,I came home with no pants.
Leonard,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
Leonard,She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
Leonard,"Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to call it off."
Leonard,"Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
Leonard,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
Leonard,Not yet.
Leonard,Nice little bot you’ve got here.
Leonard,"What’s this do, spin?"
Leonard,"Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
Leonard,"I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
Leonard,"Run, Monte, run!"
Leonard,"Go, go, go, go!"
Leonard,"Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
Leonard,Forget the robot. What happened to you?
Leonard,Penny.
Leonard,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?"
Leonard,"Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
Leonard,Hey Kripke.
Leonard,"Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore."
Leonard,Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
Leonard,There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
Leonard,"Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line."
Leonard,Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
Leonard,"Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen."
Leonard,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
Leonard,I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
Leonard,"I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons."
Leonard,I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
Leonard,I answered every question Sheldon.
Leonard,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?"
Leonard,"Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
Leonard,Hold on. I put some real work into that!
Leonard,"It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
Leonard,"What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
Leonard,"Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
Leonard,On the floor.
Leonard,Then why learn how to swim?
Leonard,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives."
Leonard,Where are we going?
Leonard,Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
Leonard,"Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what are you doing?"
Leonard,"No you’re not, let’s go."
Leonard,"Don’t look up, there’s cameras."
Leonard,"Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
Leonard,"Yes, he’s new at the zoo."
Leonard,"Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop."
Leonard,I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
Leonard,It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
Leonard,How was rock climbing?
Leonard,Want some Chinese food?
Leonard,In the bathroom.
Leonard,What’s that?
Leonard,Can I whistle?
Leonard,He had Lysine but changed it.
Leonard,I didn’t think he had it in him.
Leonard,Hmmm.
Leonard,"We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45."
Leonard,"Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
Leonard,"Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."
Leonard,"Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?"
Leonard,"Bye, Sheldon."
Leonard,Interesting.
Leonard,Do I have to?
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. How was work?"
Leonard,Stop it!
Leonard,"He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating."
Leonard,Weird.
Leonard,Did you guys have an argument?
Leonard,"Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
Leonard,"Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up."
Leonard,"Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce."
Leonard,Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
Leonard,"It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars."
Leonard,"Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. "
Leonard,"It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
Leonard,"Oh, wait, you lent her money?"
Leonard,Where are you going?
Leonard,"But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"A little mood lighting, huh?"
Leonard,"Yeah, they’re very considerate that way."
Leonard,"Fourteen dollars, huh?"
Leonard,"Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
Leonard,So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
Leonard,"Well, what was the plan?"
Leonard,Was there a plan B?
Leonard,"It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
Leonard,You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
Leonard,"Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?"
Leonard,"Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
Leonard,Your ex-boyfriend?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I would hope so.
Leonard,Did he pay you back?
Leonard,And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
Leonard,"Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that."
Leonard,"Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?"
Leonard,"Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on?"
Leonard,"Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
Leonard,– Come on. It’ll be fun.
Leonard,"Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him."
Leonard,Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
Leonard,I could use some help.
Leonard,"You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
Leonard,I do.
Leonard,I’m not afraid of him.
Leonard,"Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?"
Leonard,Well?
Leonard,Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
Leonard,"You guys suck.  Come on, please? He’s so big."
Leonard,"Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
Leonard,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him."
Leonard,"Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
Leonard,"Hi, Kurt."
Leonard,"I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj."
Leonard,"Sheldon, not now."
Leonard,"Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
Leonard,"No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
Leonard,"Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
Leonard,"No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off."
Leonard,No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
Leonard,"I guess, technically, that was my fault.  I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money."
Leonard,I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
Leonard,It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
Leonard,"Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
Leonard,Really? Did he say why?
Leonard,That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
Leonard,"No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
Leonard,"Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable."
Leonard,"Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit."
Leonard,"Good to see you, Mother."
Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I’ll start again.
Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?"
Leonard,"Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation."
Leonard,"So, Mother, what’s new?"
Leonard,"All right. Uh, what’s new with you?"
Leonard,Maybe something less personal.
Leonard,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
Leonard,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off."
Leonard,"I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
Leonard,"Please, don’t go there, Howard."
Leonard,"Boy, you suck."
Leonard,Why are you doing this?
Leonard,"You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
Leonard,That was fast.
Leonard,Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
Leonard,He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
Leonard,"You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
Leonard,"There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
Leonard,Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,You got alcohol?
Leonard,Yep.
Leonard,"Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
Leonard,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
Leonard,She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
Leonard,You can’t let her get into your head.
Leonard,It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom."
Leonard,Did you get the part?
Leonard,"Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
Leonard,"Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine."
Leonard,"Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
Leonard,You know what the saddest part was?
Leonard,My father used to borrow it.
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick."
Leonard,"Right. Ah! Where’s the lime?  Oh, okay, we’re sharing."
Leonard,This is actually gonna happen.
Leonard,"You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children."
Leonard,I don’t know. Foreplay?
Leonard,"Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”"
Leonard,"Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that."
Leonard,She said shush. I should have shushed. 
Leonard,"All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight."
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,You don’t have to. Ever.
Leonard,"Good-bye, Mother."
Leonard,There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
Leonard,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
Leonard,"No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky."
Leonard,"Yeah, more cutbacks."
Leonard,"You know what baffles me, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Are you done?
Leonard,"What about it, Howard?"
Leonard,I don’t care about that.
Leonard,You and Leslie?
Leonard,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
Leonard,Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
Leonard,Here we go.
Leonard,Don’t sit in his spot.
Leonard,"Okay, that should do it."
Leonard,That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
Leonard,Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
Leonard,There’s a chance.
Leonard,"We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
Leonard,"Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it."
Leonard,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
Leonard,We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
Leonard,"Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print."
Leonard,It’s too small and too perfect.
Leonard,You’re welcome.
Leonard,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
Leonard,"Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly."
Leonard,Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
Leonard,"No, no, friends forgive the little things."
Leonard,"Don’t you dare, missy."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,"I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that."
Leonard,Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
Leonard,Wackadoodle.
Leonard,"If it were your head, it would be."
Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon."
Leonard,"No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story."
Leonard,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
Leonard,That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
Leonard,Get out.
Leonard,Why are you crouching there?
Leonard,I don’t know. Texas?
Leonard,"Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new."
Leonard,"Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him."
Leonard,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news."
Leonard,I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
Leonard,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
Leonard,Golden Dragon.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car."
Leonard,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
Leonard,"Oh, God, I wish I had."
Leonard,"Yeah, buddy?"
Leonard,"Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming."
Leonard,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
Leonard,"Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
Leonard,"What is it, Sheldon? "
Leonard,"Sheldon, Penny was our only hope."
Leonard,He’s right. You can’t. 
Leonard,Where are you going?
Leonard,"Okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar."
Leonard,It’s perfect.
Leonard,"It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny."
Leonard,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
Leonard,You’ve heard of him?
Leonard,"Yeah, I wish."
Leonard,"Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
Leonard,"Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?"
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?"
Leonard,Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
Leonard,I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up."
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco."
Leonard,"Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
Leonard,Is that who I think it is?
Leonard,Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,At least he’s off the train crap.
Leonard,My money’s on tuck and roll.
Leonard,"Excuse me, but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?"
Leonard,"You know, I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one."
Leonard,So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
Leonard,"She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?"
Leonard,You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
Leonard,What’s the matter?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive."
Leonard,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
Leonard,So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
Leonard,Right. Of course.
Leonard,"Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
Leonard,"Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
Leonard,I’ve got a better idea.
Leonard,"Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
Leonard,So?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place."
Leonard,"Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It’s Leonard."
Leonard,"He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour."
Leonard,Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
Leonard,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
Leonard,"I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. It’s Leonard."
Leonard,"Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Leonard again."
Leonard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
Leonard,"Excuse me.  Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…"
Leonard,"Hi, my name’s Leonard."
Leonard,Ready.
Leonard,Damn it. I slipped.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked."
Leonard,Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
Leonard,Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
Leonard,Hello?
Leonard,"W-W-Wait, what’s going on?"
Leonard,"Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
Leonard,What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
Leonard,She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
Leonard,Where?
Leonard,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
Leonard,"Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
Leonard,"Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want."
Leonard,"I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?"
Leonard,"Okay, what’s wrong with it?"
Leonard,Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
Leonard,You want to fire me?
Leonard,"Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two."
Leonard,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
Leonard,Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
Leonard,"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."
Leonard,Amazon offers one-day rush.
Leonard,Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,How are we doing?
Leonard,"Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
Leonard,"Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
Leonard,Bam.
Leonard,I can’t believe we actually did it.
Leonard,I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
Leonard,"We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms."
Leonard,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
Leonard,Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
Leonard,"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey."
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s not that bad."
Leonard,"So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please."
Leonard,Shh-shh-shh!
Leonard,No!
Leonard,Why would you just say something like that?
Leonard,"Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
Leonard,Why are you making it worse?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I’m sorry, that really is how it works."
Leonard,"Raj, help me out here."
Leonard,"Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?"
Leonard,The box says kitchen.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,"That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment."
Leonard,"Yeah, it is."
Leonard,Sheldon…
Leonard,You’re making her uncomfortable.
Leonard,Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour."
Leonard,I’m helping.
Leonard,I think you look fantastic.
Leonard,"Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
Leonard,"Alicia is an actress, just like you."
Leonard,"Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?"
Leonard,"Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay."
Leonard,"It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?"
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d love to."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me."
Leonard,"Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
Leonard,You want to watch Battlestar?
Leonard,What’s wrong?
Leonard,"Oh, I’d watch that."
Leonard,"Okay, well, I’ll take you."
Leonard,Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"I had to, she called me cutie."
Leonard,Problem?
Leonard,"Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
Leonard,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
Leonard,You’re joking.
Leonard,"You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
Leonard,"Oh, absolutely."
Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
Leonard,"You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
Leonard,"Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
Leonard,"Come on, I’ll help you pick something."
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books."
Leonard,"I think we’re fine, Stuart."
Leonard,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
Leonard,"Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."
Leonard,"Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make."
Leonard,Problem?
Leonard,"Uh, cut it in half?"
Leonard,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
Leonard,"Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
Leonard,Apparently so.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
Leonard,"Sure, why not?"
Leonard,"Gee, thanks a lot."
Leonard,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
Leonard,"You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart."
Leonard,"And you guys are going together, great…"
Leonard,"Hey, Howard?"
Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
Leonard,That’s your system?
Leonard,How about those two?
Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
Leonard,I think Blinky’s cute.
Leonard,"Wait, so we just go over there?"
Leonard,What else you got?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
Leonard,"Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
Leonard,Say what?
Leonard,Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
Leonard,"Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry."
Leonard,Yes
Leonard,Yes
Leonard,"God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia."
Leonard,Yes
Leonard,Yes
Leonard,Yes
Leonard,You got it.
Leonard,"No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
Leonard,"Alright, back to the game."
Leonard,We were up to you.
Leonard,"Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
Leonard,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?"
Leonard,"I’ve never been there, have you?"
Leonard,"Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas."
Leonard,"Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now."
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?"
Leonard,"Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
Leonard,"Howard, could I borrow some after shave?"
Leonard,That is a lot of cologne.
Leonard,"Come on, let’s go."
Leonard,"That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page."
Leonard,Alright.
Leonard,"Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon."
Leonard,"Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment."
Leonard,"Yeah, I really need to talk to you."
Leonard,"Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute."
Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
Leonard,"Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
Leonard,"Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”"
Leonard,You think that’d help?
Leonard,"I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy."
Leonard,We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
Leonard,Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…"
Leonard,"Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
Leonard,I think she knows what I meant.
Leonard,"Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…"
Leonard,"Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
Leonard,Behold?
Leonard,"Hey, how’s it going."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,What were you doing at Penny’s?
Leonard,"Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
Leonard,"Oh, sure, what’s up?"
Leonard,"Yeah, vaguely."
Leonard,What about it?
Leonard,"Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
Leonard,Why the hell not?
Leonard,Nobody wants that.
Leonard,"Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
Leonard,"Yeah, or you call me."
Leonard,Or nobody calls anyone.
Leonard,"You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj."
Leonard,I’m listening.
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,"Good, good. You?"
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,About what?
Leonard,"No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me."
Leonard,"Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!"
Leonard,About Stuart? Love to.
Leonard,"Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store."
Leonard,Oh. It’s Stuart.
Leonard,He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
Leonard,Why would he call me?
Leonard,"I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon."
Leonard,"No! There, it went to voice mail."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,It must be hell inside your head.
Leonard,How teeny tiny?
Leonard,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
Leonard,"So, what do you need us for?"
Leonard,Good one.
Leonard,Hey Stuart.
Leonard,Um…
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken."
Leonard,"Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken."
Leonard,"All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial."
Leonard,"You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
Leonard,"Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break."
Leonard,"Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight."
Leonard,It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
Leonard,I feel terrible.
Leonard,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
Leonard,Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
Leonard,"Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…"
Leonard,Okay… I just… I kind of…
Leonard,Comic book store.
Leonard,"‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries."
Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, Howard."
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you."
Leonard,"I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize."
Leonard,It was?
Leonard,You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
Leonard,Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
Leonard,"During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once."
Leonard,Leonard?
Leonard,"Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
Leonard,"No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out."
Leonard,"Yeah, how about that? See you soon."
Leonard,Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
Leonard,"Yes, you did, didn’t you?"
Leonard,What was it doing on the ceiling?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Then what was oh, boy?"
Leonard,There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,"Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning."
Leonard,Everybody?
Leonard,You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
Leonard,"You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to."
Leonard,Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
Leonard,Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
Leonard,"Okay, well, do you want to go?"
Leonard,"Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
Leonard,Maybe.
Leonard,"Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now."
Leonard,"Well, then don’t go."
Leonard,"All right, then go."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
Leonard,How was it resolved?
Leonard,I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
Leonard,It’s not gonna be the same without you.
Leonard,Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
Leonard,"Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I’m in.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?"
Leonard,"Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you."
Leonard,"Actually, it would help."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Did she seem upset to you?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,A little bit.
Leonard,"I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?"
Leonard,"I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!"
Leonard,"Okay, I can’t do this."
Leonard,"Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant."
Leonard,"Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?"
Leonard,"Oh, a blanket."
Leonard,"Oh, wow, cool."
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s me."
Leonard,"Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition."
Leonard,I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s very comforting."
Leonard,"Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go."
Leonard,Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
Leonard,It’s a blanket with sleeves.
Leonard,"Yes, obviously."
Leonard,"Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
Leonard,"So, I can’t go."
Leonard,You really think so?
Leonard,"It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you."
Leonard,What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
Leonard,"All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?"
Leonard,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
Leonard,Glad we cleared that up.
Leonard,I guess I’ll see you.
Leonard,Thank you. Bye.
Leonard,Damn it.
Leonard,We’re out of ice.
Leonard,"Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
Leonard,Dinner’s ready!
Leonard,Reconstituted Thai food.
Leonard,Check.
Leonard,Check.
Leonard,"Uh, oh, sorry."
Leonard,"Oh, thank God we’re home."
Leonard,I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
Leonard,"Yeah, I just stopped by to say…  Yeah, so, hi!"
Leonard,"I missed you, too."
Leonard,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask."
Leonard,"Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
Leonard,It was the only way to make him happy.
Leonard,"Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
Leonard,"No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results."
Leonard,"Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
Leonard,"Yeah, I feel terrible."
Leonard,"What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
Leonard,"Man, I cannot catch a break."
Leonard,"Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better."
Leonard,Howard…
Leonard,"Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business."
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
Leonard,Come on. We said we were sorry.
Leonard,So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
Leonard,"Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this."
Leonard,It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
Leonard,Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
Leonard,"It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…  "
Leonard,"Man, I can not catch a break."
Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
Leonard,"Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
Leonard,"Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!"
Leonard,"Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya."
Leonard,"Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Maybe you can.
Leonard,I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
Leonard,Saloons?
Leonard,What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
Leonard,Will you please take that stupid hat off?
Leonard,– We took the red-eye.
Leonard,"Uh, no, thank you."
Leonard,"Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it."
Leonard,"Uh, yes, ma’am."
Leonard,We came to apologize.
Leonard,"And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
Leonard,"No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
Leonard,How about that? I finally caught a break.
Leonard,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
Leonard,Why does it have to get weird?
Leonard,"I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…"
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,Totally.
Leonard,"Hey, guys."
Leonard,What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
Leonard,"There’s more to life than sex, Raj."
Leonard,"Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
Leonard,It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
Leonard,"Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine."
Leonard,"I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…"
Leonard,"All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be."
Leonard,"Sheldon, dinner’s here."
Leonard,"No, we went somewhere new."
Leonard,"No, look, Mumbai Palace."
Leonard,"Trust me, this will be just fine."
Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
Leonard,I don’t know
Leonard,Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
Leonard,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?"
Leonard,Please don’t be mad.
Leonard,"Nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
Leonard,Okay?
Leonard,"So, you’ve been through this before?"
Leonard,Okay-dokay.
Leonard,So much.
Leonard,"Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
Leonard,More wine?
Leonard,What are we drinking now?
Leonard,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun."
Leonard,"I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. "
Leonard,"God, I had the most horrible night."
Leonard,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
Leonard,Hey. What’s going on?
Leonard,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Leonard,"Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?"
Leonard,Interesting.
Leonard,Excuse me.
Leonard,Little bit. 
Leonard,"Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?"
Leonard,Is that what you want?
Leonard,I guess.
Leonard,"It would, wouldn’t it?"
Leonard,"Good, good."
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
Leonard,"We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
Leonard,"No, her bed kind of… broke."
Leonard,Perfectly formed miniature human being.
Leonard,Don’t do that.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny."
Leonard,"I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
Leonard,It’s a… 
Leonard,Wow!
Leonard,"Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
Leonard,"Come on, you guys, let it go."
Leonard,What was that?
Leonard,"It does. But in my experience, you don’t."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
Leonard,"Howard, what did you do?"
Leonard,Why are you carrying extras?
Leonard,"In this case, you bet she is."
Leonard,They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
Leonard,Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
Leonard,"Okay, I know what you’re doing."
Leonard,"Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
Leonard,"No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
Leonard,"Well, you shouldn’t."
Leonard,"No, this has to stop now."
Leonard,"No, you’re not sanding Penny."
Leonard,"Yes, you’re forbidden."
Leonard,What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
Leonard,Forget it.
Leonard,"I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
Leonard,Unbelievable.
Leonard,"I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
Leonard,"Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
Leonard,Let’s go.
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus."
Leonard,What’s he on trial for?
Leonard,Oh. I’ll be there.
Leonard,"So, what’s going on with Raj?"
Leonard,"What do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
Leonard,"So, what’s going on?"
Leonard,"So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
Leonard,"Don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
Leonard,I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
Leonard,What are you thinking?
Leonard,You are a dirty girl.
Leonard,"Hi, Howard."
Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,"You know, whatever."
Leonard,That was fun. Thank you.
Leonard,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,"Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk."
Leonard,"Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."
Leonard,"Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up."
Leonard,Good.
Leonard,I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,Okay. Howard come back.
Leonard,"Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em."
Leonard,"Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
Leonard,Just play a potion card.
Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t ruin the game."
Leonard,See? Ruined.
Leonard,Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t remember that."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Leonard,"Howard, you can’t hold me to that."
Leonard,"Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would."
Leonard,"Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?"
Leonard,But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
Leonard,"No, I haven’t."
Leonard,"Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to."
Leonard,"It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
Leonard,Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,I’ll see what I can do.
Leonard,Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
Leonard,"Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
Leonard,"Okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie."
Leonard,Over puppets?
Leonard,"Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you."
Leonard,"No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
Leonard,"Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…"
Leonard,"Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy."
Leonard,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
Leonard,"Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?"
Leonard,Another delightful surprise for her.
Leonard,Gonna be a long night.
Leonard,I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
Leonard,"Long, long night."
Leonard,How about that? Einstein was wrong.
Leonard,Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
Leonard,"Kites, ho!"
Leonard,"If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho."
Leonard,We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
Leonard,You want to come watch?
Leonard,"Oh. Football, sure."
Leonard,"No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good."
Leonard,"Yeah, great."
Leonard,"Well, this sucks."
Leonard,Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
Leonard,"Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her."
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,"So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?"
Leonard,"Oh, how kind of her."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,How was your football party?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
Leonard,"Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"
Leonard,Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
Leonard,I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
Leonard,"Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."
Leonard,"Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends."
Leonard,Another football game?
Leonard,Did not know that.
Leonard,"Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,"Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this."
Leonard,"Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj."
Leonard,"There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
Leonard,"Sacks, sacks…"
Leonard,Huh… Scrimmage…
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,Apparently.
Leonard,"Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
Leonard,Unbelievable.
Leonard,So you could teach me?
Leonard,Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun."
Leonard,"Please, I’m asking you as a friend."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I really appreciate this.
Leonard,I’m sorry?
Leonard,When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
Leonard,What’s wrong with a football jersey?
Leonard,"I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs."
Leonard,"Anyway, wish me luck."
Leonard,"Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, like you said."
Leonard,"Good-Bye, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
Leonard,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
Leonard,Oh. Did not know that.
Leonard,"None, why?"
Leonard,"Okay, yeah. I can see the difference."
Leonard,"That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
Leonard,"Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant."
Leonard,Mimesis?
Leonard,What the hell are you talking about?
Leonard,"Oh, I guess so."
Leonard,"I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here."
Leonard,"Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs."
Leonard,"No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left."
Leonard,This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
Leonard,"Oh, you’re kidding me."
Leonard,Nice meeting all of you.
Leonard,We must not be playing it right.
Leonard,"Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday."
Leonard,Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
Leonard,"There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?"
Leonard,Wait. What are you talking about?
Leonard,Who is this Justin?
Leonard,"No, you didn’t."
Leonard,Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
Leonard,"So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
Leonard,"Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee."
Leonard,"Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
Leonard,What was your first clue?
Leonard,I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
Leonard,"You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?"
Leonard,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
Leonard,The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
Leonard,He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
Leonard,"I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender."
Leonard,"No, we just had a little spat."
Leonard,I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
Leonard,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
Leonard,"An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
Leonard,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
Leonard,"What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Calm down, we’ll make the movie."
Leonard,"Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies."
Leonard,"Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
Leonard,Just give us a minute.
Leonard,"So, are we going to talk about last night?"
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Oh, come on. This is stupid."
Leonard,"No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
Leonard,"No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!"
Leonard,"Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."
Leonard,"Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
Leonard,Thank you!
Leonard,I am not going to fold.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
Leonard,"Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"
Leonard,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
Leonard,Why didn’t you say so?
Leonard,"Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!"
Leonard,What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
Leonard,"The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
Leonard,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
Leonard,"It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
Leonard,"Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
Leonard,Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
Leonard,Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
Leonard,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
Leonard,"Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
Leonard,"Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Dune."
Leonard,Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.
Leonard,"I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
Leonard,"Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
Leonard,"Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do."
Leonard,"Mmmm, not bad."
Leonard,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
Leonard,"I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down."
Leonard,Better. Thanks.
Leonard,What’s so funny?
Leonard,I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
Leonard,You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
Leonard,"People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?"
Leonard,No. That was the last pudding cup.
Leonard,"That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
Leonard,The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
Leonard,"Oh, god, I am so hungry."
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
Leonard,What kind of score are we looking at?
Leonard,"All right, everyone grab flashlights."
Leonard,"Quick, get forks."
Leonard,I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
Leonard,He struck out.
Leonard,"With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates."
Leonard,"No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
Leonard,The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
Leonard,"Never mind, what’s your announcement?"
Leonard,Are you really going to be on NPR?
Leonard,"Very cool, congratulations."
Leonard,"You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
Leonard,"Excuse me, I’m sitting here."
Leonard,"Again, I’m right here."
Leonard,"I am here, right? You see me."
Leonard,"How ya doin’, buddy?"
Leonard,"Come on, it wasn’t that bad."
Leonard,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you."
Leonard,Raj.
Leonard,"I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back."
Leonard,Are you really admitting defeat?
Leonard,Good.
Leonard,What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
Leonard,You’re not helping.
Leonard,"Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
Leonard,"No, no."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
Leonard,Let’s keep thinking.
Leonard,"This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?"
Leonard,"Let me guess, motion sensors?"
Leonard,"I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. "
Leonard,Who is that with him?
Leonard,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
Leonard,At least they don’t know it was you.
Leonard,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
Leonard,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
Leonard,Yeah. Hey.
Leonard,"Sure. The more, the merrier."
Leonard,Sheldon…
Leonard,"Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
Leonard,That’s where Sheldon sits.
Leonard,I am. Are you interested in physics?
Leonard,"Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
Leonard,"Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
Leonard,"Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I got it."
Leonard,"Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
Leonard,You’re welcome to come.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,Yeah? So?
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,Has it ever worked?
Leonard,"Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend."
Leonard,I believe you.
Leonard,What did I do now?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
Leonard,What was I supposed to tell her?
Leonard,And what would that be?
Leonard,You told her my experiment was stupid?
Leonard,"Should I, um, leave you two alone?"
Leonard,"Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go."
Leonard,We’re shocked.
Leonard,"Or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
Leonard,He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
Leonard,It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
Leonard,"Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now."
Leonard,I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
Leonard,"When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun."
Leonard,We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
Leonard,"Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
Leonard,"Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
Leonard,Here we go.
Leonard,"Merry Newton-mas, everyone."
Leonard,"No, he doesn’t."
Leonard,"Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man."
Leonard,Tomorrow.
Leonard,"Um, tomorrow?"
Leonard,"Well, I just, I thought…"
Leonard,"You are, it’s just…"
Leonard,"I know. And those specials, they change every day."
Leonard,"Okay, sorry."
Leonard,Um…
Leonard,Um…
Leonard,Um…
Leonard,"I drove, Mother. I’m driving now."
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?"
Leonard,"No, I heard that."
Leonard,I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
Leonard,"Fine, Mom. How are you?"
Leonard,Now I’m less fine.
Leonard,"No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
Leonard,You must be very happy.
Leonard,"Not the time, Sheldon."
Leonard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Leonard,All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
Leonard,"Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,No!
Leonard,When did this happen?
Leonard,Mitzy’s dead?
Leonard,I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
Leonard,"You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!"
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,I don’t want tea.
Leonard,Then why are you telling me?
Leonard,That’s a lousy conversation starter.
Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Leonard,I want that too. Why are you here?
Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very comforting."
Leonard,It’s not?
Leonard,"You’re right, I do feel better."
Leonard,You’re my surrogate family?
Leonard,What the hell is going on?
Leonard,Are you guys drunk?
Leonard,How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
Leonard,I do.
Leonard,"Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here."
Leonard,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
Leonard,"What the hell, agreed."
Leonard,"Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
Leonard,I’m over it.
Leonard,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
Leonard,"Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?"
Leonard,"What are you trying to tell me, Howard?"
Leonard,Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
Leonard,Got it.
Leonard,"Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette."
Leonard,How did we get actual women?
Leonard,"I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
Leonard,Great. How come?
Leonard,"Of course, I would never make fun of you."
Leonard,"Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site."
Leonard,You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
Leonard,"Come on, Penny."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, but facts are facts."
Leonard,"No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
Leonard,You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here."
Leonard,Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
Leonard,"You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… "
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,What the hell is eighth base?
Leonard,"Oh, couldn’t be better."
Leonard,It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
Leonard,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
Leonard,And that didn’t bother you?
Leonard,"What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?"
Leonard,"Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
Leonard,"What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard."
Leonard,What is that?
Leonard,"Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you."
Leonard,"No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
Leonard,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
Leonard,"Okay, let’s go see your psychic."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
Leonard,"No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,"I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
Leonard,"Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
Leonard,So what? It’s the same food.
Leonard,It’s obviously a typo.
Leonard,You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
Leonard,And why is that?
Leonard,What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
Leonard,So are our laptops.
Leonard,We like games.
Leonard,What about me?
Leonard,Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
Leonard,How is that going to help them?
Leonard,What are we supposed to do now?
Leonard,Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
Leonard,"Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared."
Leonard,Hand me the bat.
Leonard,"We’re fine, Sheldon."
Leonard,Mm-hmm.
Leonard,"Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed."
Leonard,What do you want?
Leonard,But you don’t like other people.
Leonard,"It’s getting scary here, too."
Leonard,Did we win? Can we go to bed?
Leonard,"He’s right, Penny. It’s all there."
Leonard,Great. Good night.
Leonard,4am.
Leonard,Just keep walking. 
Leonard,Who is it?
Leonard,I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
Leonard,Where did you get all this stuff?
Leonard,He just gave it to you?
Leonard,"Sorry, let me help you."
Leonard,"God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?"
Leonard,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
Leonard,We were going to have…
Leonard,What are you doing? Use the door.
Leonard,"Great, you do that."
Leonard,I’m lactose intolerant.
Leonard,Sorry about that.
Leonard,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
Leonard,Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
Leonard,"Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it."
Leonard,"Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?"
Leonard,They call themselves Bozites?
Leonard,"Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
Leonard,"Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off."
Leonard,"Aye, aye, Captain."
Leonard,Maybe you need a fresh start.
Leonard,Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
Leonard,"No, I think it’s a firmware problem."
Leonard,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
Leonard,"Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
Leonard,I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
Leonard,"Here, you want my peas?"
Leonard,"So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
Leonard,"Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?"
Leonard,"You had some nice moves out there, Howard."
Leonard,Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
Leonard,Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
Leonard,Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
Leonard,"Oh, my God! Are you… "
Leonard,Are you okay?
Leonard,"Don’t bark at me. I fell, too."
Leonard,"No, that’s a crazy thing."
Leonard,That was amazing how you handled him.
Leonard,"It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman."
Leonard,"Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it."
Leonard,"Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there."
Leonard,Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
Leonard,Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
Leonard,Thanks for not calling the cops.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?"
Leonard,"Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?"
Leonard,"No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now."
Leonard,"If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out."
Leonard,"For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
Leonard,Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
Leonard,Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m going to need a little more."
Leonard,Keep going.
Leonard,"So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
Leonard,Sounds like a great plan.
Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night."
Leonard,Told you.
Leonard,"Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?"
Leonard,Double guacamole?
Leonard,No cilantro?
Leonard,"Lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
Leonard,You understand why I’m doing this to you?
Leonard,That’ll be all. That was fun.
Leonard,"I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
Leonard,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
Leonard,Sheldon took our order.
Leonard,"Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
Leonard,"Sheldon, come here."
Leonard,Who’s miserable and alone?
Leonard,Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
Leonard,"Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?"
Leonard,"Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?"
Leonard,That’s not what I was going to tell you.
Leonard,Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
Leonard,"Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing."
Leonard,"In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
Leonard,Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
Leonard,I am taking Penny.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you got a minute?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland."
Leonard,Penny.
Leonard,"Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six."
Leonard,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
Leonard,"No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,How does that involve air travel?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
Leonard,"Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny."
Leonard,Not the roommate agreement.
Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sakes."
Leonard,"Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland."
Leonard,It is.
Leonard,What do you think? 
Leonard,"Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
Leonard,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
Leonard,Rupert Murdoch?
Leonard,You seen Sheldon?
Leonard,"Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
Leonard,Seriously?
Leonard,"Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,You made Frodo pancakes?
Leonard,Why are you doing this?
Leonard,Thanks. It’s good.
Leonard,You hate Babylon 5.
Leonard,"Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I need to talk to you."
Leonard,Some what?
Leonard,You’re not going to Switzerland!
Leonard,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
Leonard,"Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!"
Leonard,I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
Leonard,"Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you."
Leonard,"Yeah, really."
Leonard,I’m sorry you feel that way.
Leonard,Why don’t you enlighten me?
Leonard,"Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day."
Leonard,Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
Leonard,Oh!
Leonard,"Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
Leonard,"Not really, I’m just an enthusiast."
Leonard,Penny? You okay?
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,"Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. "
Leonard,"Yeah, I forgot about all this."
Leonard,Will you please turn your shirt off?
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?"
Leonard,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
Leonard,"I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. "
Leonard,He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
Leonard,Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
Leonard,Stan Lee.
Leonard,"No, no, Stan Lee."
Leonard,"You have no idea who he is, do you?"
Leonard,"Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?"
Leonard,Nope.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,That’s Bruce Lee.
Leonard,It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
Leonard,Whoa! What do you mean all?
Leonard,"Yeah, okay. No."
Leonard,That’s what I’m saying.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, why would you do that?"
Leonard,Sheldon’s in jail?
Leonard,For what?
Leonard,So tell him to apologize.
Leonard,"Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye."
Leonard,"Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?"
Leonard,"Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
Leonard,"Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
Leonard,Except for Raj.
Leonard,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Leonard,"One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle."
Leonard,"Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food."
Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is better."
Leonard,"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."
Leonard,"Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
Leonard,We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
Leonard,"No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind."
Leonard,"Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical."
Leonard,"Okay, bye."
Leonard,"Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,And in the darkness bind them.
Leonard,Seedy underbelly?
Leonard,"He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?"
Leonard,"No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."
Leonard,How is this maritime salvage?
Leonard,"Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him."
Leonard,"We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?"
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Give me that.
Leonard,You always get your way.
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it."
Leonard,This ring.
Leonard,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
Leonard,"It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
Leonard,How am I looking now?
Leonard,What was that?
Leonard,That’s my girl.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
Leonard,No Jet Skis.
Leonard,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?"
Leonard,Give me that.
Leonard,"Okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
Leonard,"I’m not letting go, you let go."
Leonard,Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
Leonard,"All right, it starts now."
Leonard,And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
Leonard,You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
Leonard,"Oh, crap!"
Leonard,Door. 
Leonard,"Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I’m out.
Leonard,It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
Leonard,Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
Leonard,"I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it."
Leonard,"There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious."
Leonard,NEVER!
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science."
Leonard,"Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You."
Leonard,You won.
Leonard,"Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"What, to you, is a large crowd?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Sit down, we want to talk to you."
Leonard,We think we can help you with your stage fright.
Leonard,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men."
Leonard,"Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
Leonard,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
Leonard,"My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
Leonard,"So, Sheldon, how you doing?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’ll start again."
Leonard,"Um, I don’t know, maybe."
Leonard,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
Leonard,Why don’t we just talk?
Leonard,"Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
Leonard,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back."
Leonard,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
Leonard,It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
Leonard,"Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again."
Leonard,For what?
Leonard,"Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!"
Leonard,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… "
Leonard,"Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Leonard,You might want to check YouTube.
Leonard,It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
Leonard,"Uh-uh, give it a minute."
Leonard,"No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder."
Leonard,Did you just quote Star Wars?
Leonard,"Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny."
Leonard,You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
Leonard,Good. Glad is good.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Yeah, probably."
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
Leonard,I honestly don’t care.
Leonard,What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
Leonard,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
Leonard,"No, there was no spat."
Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
Leonard,What? No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I’m walking away from you now.
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Leonard,You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
Leonard,Chilli cheese fry?
Leonard,Really? You love them?
Leonard,No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
Leonard,Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
Leonard,"Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?"
Leonard,How can you not be sure?
Leonard,"No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night."
Leonard,I am not pushing anything.
Leonard,"What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good."
Leonard,"All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
Leonard,Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
Leonard,"Yeah, I do."
Leonard,"Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great."
Leonard,Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
Leonard,"This is fun, huh?"
Leonard,It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
Leonard,"Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up."
Leonard,"Penny, you’re up."
Leonard,We really need a strike here.
Leonard,So just take your time and concentrate.
Leonard,I’m not pressuring you.
Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up."
Leonard,"Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it."
Leonard,"No, let her go."
Leonard,I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
Leonard,"No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry."
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
Leonard,"Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"So, you guys want to do something tonight?"
Leonard,"What about you, Raj?"
Leonard,I never stopped hanging out with you.
Leonard,You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
Leonard,Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,"Where you going with this, Raj?"
Leonard,"So, go."
Leonard,And you think my presence will help with that?
Leonard,"I’m not going out tonight, Raj."
Leonard,Very much.
Leonard,Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
Leonard,"Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
Leonard,"I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
Leonard,"I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys."
Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
Leonard,For an hour and a half?
Leonard,How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
Leonard,What the hell was that about?
Leonard,"Oh, we really need to get you a girl."
Leonard,"Oh, just come in!"
Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
Leonard,What do you want?
Leonard,I’m in bed!
Leonard,Sheldon!
Leonard,"Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?"
Leonard,Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
Leonard,Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
Leonard,Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I guess not.
Leonard,"D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
Leonard,You used to it yet?
Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine."
Leonard,His mother?
Leonard,I was going to do that.
Leonard,"No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it."
Leonard,I just took him for shoes.
Leonard,Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
Leonard,You’re taking him to Disneyland?
Leonard,All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
Leonard,All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
Leonard,"And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
Leonard,"Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it."
Leonard,Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
Leonard,"It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
Leonard,I was going to see that with him.
Leonard,And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
Leonard,We’re not fighting.
Leonard,Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
Leonard,Want a cup of coffee?
Leonard,Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
Leonard,What am I smelling?
Leonard,Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
Leonard,Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
Leonard,Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
Leonard,"Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
Leonard,Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s just one sneeze.  You’re on your own."
Leonard,"When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?"
Leonard,Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
Leonard,I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
Leonard,"She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"
Leonard,"Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer."
Leonard,"Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live"
Leonard,"Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?"
Leonard,"Look, it’s you."
Leonard,"Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
Leonard,"Well, I understand, too."
Leonard,"Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
Leonard,"Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart."
Leonard,Yes?
Leonard,Is everything all right?
Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you."
Leonard,"I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across."
Leonard,"Uh, six."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
Leonard,Wow. You really make science come alive.
Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
Leonard,How do you take your coffee?
Leonard,Okeydoke.
Leonard,Something his mother taught him.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
Leonard,"Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car."
Leonard,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
Leonard,"What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?"
Leonard,"I, um, I don’t follow."
Leonard,"Well, now…"
Leonard,Well…
Leonard,Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
Leonard,"Penny, I can still drive you."
Leonard,I didn’t betray Penny.
Leonard,How am I betraying you?
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess I did."
Leonard,You still have a cold?
Leonard,"Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night."
Leonard,"No, but I was awake all night."
Leonard,"No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person."
Leonard,"Hey, you."
Leonard,"Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?"
Leonard,"Sure. Black, right?"
Leonard,Coming right up.
Leonard,"Hey, who’s ready for Halo?"
Leonard,I don’t understand.
Leonard,Elizabeth? What’s going on?
Leonard,Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
Leonard,We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
Leonard,I thought we had something special.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
Leonard,"Yeah, I wanted to explain."
Leonard,I don’t?
Leonard,So you’re not judging me?
Leonard,"Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did."
Leonard,She let me.
Leonard,Leonard.
Leonard,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
Leonard,"You heard that, huh?"
Leonard,"So you agree, he’s nuts."
Leonard,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
Leonard,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.  I’d just started at the university.
Leonard,That should have been my first clue.
Leonard,"For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look."
Leonard,"Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door."
Leonard,"In retrospect, that was clue number two."
Leonard,"No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. "
Leonard,"It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
Leonard,"Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. "
Leonard,Do I get some sympathy now?
Leonard,"Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim."
Leonard,"Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret."
Leonard,"As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have."
Leonard,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
Leonard,"It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… "
Leonard,I’m getting to it. 
Leonard,"Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
Leonard,"Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
Leonard,"Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment."
Leonard,"Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. "
Leonard,"Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security."
Leonard,So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology."
Leonard,"I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it."
Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry."
Leonard,"So, we’re good?"
Leonard,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
Leonard,"Okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
Leonard,What for? It’s not going to rain.
Leonard,"Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility."
Leonard,"Relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
Leonard,"Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
Leonard,"Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny."
Leonard,"I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Leonard,Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
Leonard,We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
Leonard,It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
Leonard,"Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time."
Leonard,"Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?"
Leonard,Your company?
Leonard,"So, menus."
Leonard,"Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
Leonard,The laser?
Leonard,"Uh, that’s a great question, Zack."
Leonard,"Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun."
Leonard,"Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
Leonard,"Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses."
Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
Leonard,"Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
Leonard,"No, thanks."
Leonard,Have they found a match for you?
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,I’ll help you.
Leonard,Coming!
Leonard,Are you drunk?
Leonard,How did I ruin him?
Leonard,"Come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
Leonard,How is that my fault?
Leonard,Where are we going?
Leonard,"Why? I mean, okay."
Leonard,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
Leonard,Where’s Penny?
Leonard,I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
Leonard,"I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Leonard,"Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?"
Leonard,"Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
Leonard,Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
Leonard,"When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
Leonard,"No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing."
Leonard,"So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?"
Leonard,"How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson."
Leonard,"Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
Leonard,"If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.  I can’t do it."
Leonard,"Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie."
Leonard,"Uh, I know! It’s been a while!"
Leonard,Right. Right. So how you doing?
Leonard,"Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
Leonard,"Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Leonard,"Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Leonard,She’s not coming back.
Leonard,Thirty feet.
Leonard,"I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
Leonard,"Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
Leonard,I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
Leonard,Alright.
Leonard,"I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon."
Leonard,So how’s work?
Leonard,"Yeah, we all are."
Leonard,His girlfriend.
Leonard,Four months.
Leonard,Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
Leonard,Still digging the Shamy?
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
Leonard,"Okay, let’s see."
Leonard,"Well, then let’s un-pause it."
Leonard,"You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree."
Leonard,How about an acetylene torch?
Leonard,"Well, then what do you want us to do?"
Leonard,"You have any ideas, Raj?"
Leonard,"Okay, come on. Almost there."
Leonard,"Excuse me, could you help us out?"
Leonard,"Uh, it’s what controls the arm."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?"
Leonard,Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
Leonard,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
Leonard,How’s that?
Leonard,I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
Leonard,You can always get a badger and find out.
Leonard,"That long, huh?"
Leonard,What’s there?
Leonard,"So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
Leonard,Tough break. You want eggs?
Leonard,What’s a dogapus?
Leonard,Is somebody working on that?
Leonard,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
Leonard,It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Never mind. I got it.
Leonard,It’s no big deal.
Leonard,Hmm? How much you got?
Leonard,How can you walk around with no money?
Leonard,"It’s okay, you can owe me."
Leonard,"Sheldon, six bucks."
Leonard,"No, no, don’t ask."
Leonard,What the hell? What’s the matter?
Leonard,"There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena."
Leonard,When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
Leonard,Have you had your appendix out?
Leonard,Let’s get you to the hospital.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Funny how things work out, isn’t it?"
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,"Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani."
Leonard,"Palak paneer, that’s Penny."
Leonard,"And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets."
Leonard,"Uh, 12 bucks."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
Leonard,"Greetings, whatever the hell you are."
Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
Leonard,You’re in your bedroom.
Leonard,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
Leonard,I am looking at you.
Leonard,"You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God."
Leonard,At the hands of your roommate?
Leonard,That’s how I’m going to make it look.
Leonard,"Fine, but don’t expect my help."
Leonard,"No, it’s not."
Leonard,I’ll be damned.
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter."
Leonard,"I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,That’s it. Bye-bye. 
Leonard,Whoa!
Leonard,I almost died!
Leonard,I’m still going to go with you.
Leonard,What about it?
Leonard,Why? What’s the problem?
Leonard,"No, I think a doorknob has you stymied."
Leonard,Why are you introducing yourself?
Leonard,I think it is.
Leonard,"Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…"
Leonard,Of course you must.
Leonard,What the hell are you guys playing?
Leonard,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
Leonard,"Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know."
Leonard,"I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
Leonard,You bumped the table and you know it.
Leonard,I’m going to my room.
Leonard,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"Ah, ah."
Leonard,"So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
Leonard,"Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up."
Leonard,"Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?"
Leonard,Got it.
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
Leonard,"Yeah, not my point."
Leonard,"Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
Leonard,So we already have you for all that.
Leonard,"No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else."
Leonard,Suffered in silence?
Leonard,Really? Silence?
Leonard,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
Leonard,I did.
Leonard,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
Leonard,I didn’t agree with him.
Leonard,"I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
Leonard,"I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks."
Leonard,"Oh, no."
Leonard,John and Yoko.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…"
Leonard,"I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon."
Leonard,"No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef."
Leonard,"Uh, went splitsville."
Leonard,Turned to boom-boom.
Leonard,I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
Leonard,He got a cat to keep him company.
Leonard,"He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Hey.  Oh, no."
Leonard,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
Leonard,Zazzles?
Leonard,"Okay, we need to talk."
Leonard,"Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, fine."
Leonard,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
Leonard,"Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
Leonard,She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her."
Leonard,"Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming."
Leonard,He’s in his bedroom.
Leonard,"No, she’s real."
Leonard,"No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for."
Leonard,Hold on to that thought. 
Leonard,Surprise.
Leonard,I saw what you did there.
Leonard,"No, no, no, I can do it."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice."
Leonard,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
Leonard,Does it have melon on it?
Leonard,"No, I can’t eat melon."
Leonard,When was the last time you saw her?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette."
Leonard,"Yeah, I guessed that."
Leonard,"That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo."
Leonard,"All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
Leonard,"Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
Leonard,"Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
Leonard,"So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,"I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy."
Leonard,"Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?"
Leonard,No. Steve Patterson told me.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,He’s Glissinda the troll.
Leonard,"So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette."
Leonard,"Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf."
Leonard,"Yeah, and don’t you forget it."
Leonard,"Oh, God, what’s that smell? . Oh-ho-hoo!"
Leonard,What are you doing in there?
Leonard,Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
Leonard,Isn’t that flammable?
Leonard,"All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,So what’s going on with you two?
Leonard,"Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
Leonard,Got it.
Leonard,"No, no. Maybe a little."
Leonard,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
Leonard,"Oh, right. That."
Leonard,I’m not jealous.
Leonard,Probably. What’s your point?
Leonard,"Hmm, recently? Not much."
Leonard,"Um, shut up."
Leonard,That sounds lovely.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre."
Leonard,"Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
Leonard,"Hey, guys."
Leonard,"You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t."
Leonard,You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…"
Leonard,…who’s a friend.
Leonard,"What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?"
Leonard,"Oh. Well, good for you."
Leonard,Why don’t you just break up with her?
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
Leonard,You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,What the hell? How long has she been here?
Leonard,That was two hours ago.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"Yeah, what?"
Leonard,Yeah. So?
Leonard,"Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
Leonard,You can’t say that anymore.
Leonard,"Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
Leonard,"Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?"
Leonard,That is insane.
Leonard,"Okay, good luck."
Leonard,"Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
Leonard,"All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
Leonard,There you go.
Leonard,The volcano thing? No.
Leonard,"No, it’s just something I threw on."
Leonard,"Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts."
Leonard,"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
Leonard,"I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard."
Leonard,"No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life."
Leonard,"To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother."
Leonard,"Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?"
Leonard,What are you working on?
Leonard,"Ah, you’re going off the grid."
Leonard,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
Leonard,What if she just comes over?
Leonard,You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
Leonard,She’s been here before.
Leonard,What do you want to do?
Leonard,"Okay, where are you?"
Leonard,"Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here."
Leonard,"Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette."
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,Uh…
Leonard,"Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
Leonard,Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
Leonard,Whoa!
Leonard,"Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound."
Leonard,"Yep, it is."
Leonard,Whoa!
Leonard,"Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
Leonard,"I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect."
Leonard,It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
Leonard,"Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
Leonard,You’re asking me out?
Leonard,I look forward to it.
Leonard,Problem?
Leonard,"The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?"
Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
Leonard,"I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is."
Leonard,Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
Leonard,"Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
Leonard,Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
Leonard,"So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here."
Leonard,"It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?"
Leonard,That’s pretty cool.
Leonard,You’ve really got to get out more.
Leonard,"Yeah, well,  Sheldon’s still up."
Leonard,"Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…"
Leonard,"If the past is any indication, no."
Leonard,Drop axe.
Leonard,"Give me a minute. Sheldon,"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
Leonard,"Well then, bed mister."
Leonard,Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
Leonard,"You don’t want that, do you?"
Leonard,"Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
Leonard,"No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
Leonard,"Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!"
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
Leonard,"You’re right, you’re lost, good luck."
Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
Leonard,"I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response."
Leonard,"Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer."
Leonard,"You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India."
Leonard,"Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out."
Leonard,"Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets."
Leonard,It doesn’t?
Leonard,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman."
Leonard,Air freshener.
Leonard,"Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
Leonard,"Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
Leonard,"Uh, cream."
Leonard,Without.
Leonard,Fine. With.
Leonard,Use your best judgement.
Leonard,Sounds great.
Leonard,"Making pretty good time, huh?"
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
Leonard,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
Leonard,Like what?
Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,"Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard."
Leonard,"Alright, and Raj."
Leonard,You?
Leonard,"Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena."
Leonard,"My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?"
Leonard,"Because, well, Batman has the secret."
Leonard,Like what?
Leonard,What.
Leonard,"Kind of busy here, Sheldon."
Leonard,What do you want.
Leonard,What alibi?
Leonard,"Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?"
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,Where did you get that?
Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future."
Leonard,I didn’t see it.
Leonard,"Uh, I was out."
Leonard,"Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink."
Leonard,"To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
Leonard,"Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
Leonard,"No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
Leonard,Very hard.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
Leonard,You put moths in my food?
Leonard,"Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush."
Leonard,"Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact."
Leonard,"Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?"
Leonard,"These are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
Leonard,Papaya?
Leonard,Guava?
Leonard,I give up.
Leonard,"No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women."
Leonard,What does that have to do with me and women?
Leonard,"My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
Leonard,"Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
Leonard,Congratulations Howard.
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally."
Leonard,"Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
Leonard,"So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully."
Leonard,"Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?"
Leonard,"Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one."
Leonard,"Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding."
Leonard,"You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude."
Leonard,Want to get that?
Leonard,Could you get that?
Leonard,Would you please get that?
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,And I may have hit on her a little bit.
Leonard,I feel awful.
Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon."
Leonard,What are you doing up?
Leonard,Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
Leonard,I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
Leonard,Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Because you feel guilty?
Leonard,"Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now."
Leonard,You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
Leonard,How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,94 seconds.
Leonard,I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Leonard,"When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it."
Leonard,Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
Leonard,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
Leonard,"Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together."
Leonard,"Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight."
Leonard,"Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine."
Leonard,"Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis."
Leonard,Excellent.
Leonard,"Thank you, Amy."
Leonard,"Guys, that’s really starting to get old."
Leonard,Who’s there?
Leonard,Hysterical!
Leonard,Who‘s there?
Leonard,Hugh who?
Leonard,So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
Leonard,"Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle."
Leonard,What’s a stadium pal?
Leonard,"Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap."
Leonard,"It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep."
Leonard,"Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?"
Leonard,"Calm down, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?"
Leonard,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
Leonard,We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
Leonard,Short Round?
Leonard,"Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?"
Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon?
Leonard,What is that?
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is crazy."
Leonard,Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
Leonard,I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
Leonard,"Oh, um, is Penny here?"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Okay, I think a bit of context here might help."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Context."
Leonard,That was odd.
Leonard,You’ll never guess what just happened.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Penny kissed me.
Leonard,A big kiss. On the mouth.
Leonard,"She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
Leonard,You think?
Leonard,Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
Leonard,"I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
Leonard,Why do I bother talking to you people?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time."
Leonard,What? Why?
Leonard,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
Leonard,"Really? How, how’d we manage that?"
Leonard,"Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?"
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I don’t think so."
Leonard,"I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened."
Leonard,"Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that."
Leonard,See? He doesn’t mind.
Leonard,"Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am."
Leonard,"Come here, you."
Leonard,"Thanks for the steak, Wyatt."
Leonard,A lot of people are doing that.
Leonard,"Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper."
Leonard,Maybe I could go in a little late.
Leonard,Don’t I know it.
Leonard,"Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey."
Leonard,I love you.
Leonard,"Coming. Hey, lovebug."
Leonard,"Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?"
Leonard,"You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful."
Leonard,It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
Leonard,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
Leonard,"Well, then, what do you want?"
Leonard,Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
Leonard,"I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
Leonard,Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
Leonard,Fines?
Leonard,"Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in."
Leonard,Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
Leonard,"Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you."
Leonard,"Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this."
Leonard,No hurry.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir."
Leonard,I’ll give it a shot.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,"Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever."
Leonard,I’ll friend you on Facebook.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again."
Leonard,"Oh, how’d it go last night?"
Leonard,Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
Leonard,"It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
Leonard,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
Leonard,No. What happened?
Leonard,"12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table."
Leonard,Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
Leonard,Every idea is better than this idea.
Leonard,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
Leonard,Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
Leonard,Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
Leonard,Infinite Sheldon?
Leonard,Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, thanks."
Leonard,That’s an atom.
Leonard,"So, you and Zack again, huh?"
Leonard,They might be smarter than some people.
Leonard,A dolphin might.
Leonard,You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
Leonard,That happened to you?
Leonard,"I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology."
Leonard,Why me?
Leonard,What would I even say?
Leonard,"I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?"
Leonard,"Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack."
Leonard,"Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
Leonard,"Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
Leonard,See?
Leonard,"Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store."
Leonard,Don’t.
Leonard,"Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store."
Leonard,"Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches."
Leonard,Zack?
Leonard,You can’t replace me with Zack.
Leonard,"Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern."
Leonard,You can be Aquaman.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,You’re jogging.
Leonard,"If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
Leonard,She didn’t tell you?
Leonard,Who else would it be?
Leonard,What makes you think I can convince her?
Leonard,"Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
Leonard,It’s Leonard.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
Leonard,"Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
Leonard,Then what are you?
Leonard,Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
Leonard,Green Lantern.
Leonard,There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
Leonard,What about me?
Leonard,"Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there."
Leonard,You’re being a bully.
Leonard,What should we do?
Leonard,"Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down."
Leonard,"I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?"
Leonard,"I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
Leonard,Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
Leonard,"Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
Leonard,"I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,She’s not going to steal our idea.
Leonard,We’re gonna write an application…
Leonard,"It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…"
Leonard,Satisfied?
Leonard,That is ridiculous.
Leonard,"Okay, we need to stop for a minute."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge."
Leonard,"Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer."
Leonard,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
Leonard,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
Leonard,"So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way."
Leonard,Are you done?
Leonard,We’re not doing names now. Howard?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,That’s just Sheldon backwards.
Leonard,We’re not wasting time with names right now.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Oh Sheldon, stop it."
Leonard,"That’s enough, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Okay, that’s it, you’re fired."
Leonard,Because you’re impossible to work with.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,But I fired you.
Leonard,"No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever."
Leonard,I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
Leonard,What the hell are bus pants?
Leonard,"Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
Leonard,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
Leonard,Hold on. That’s it!
Leonard,We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
Leonard,"Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
Leonard,What are you doing?!
Leonard,"No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
Leonard,Sheldon! We’re working here!
Leonard,"No, that was completely called for. We need quiet."
Leonard,"Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
Leonard,"I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit."
Leonard,What’s he doing in your apartment?
Leonard,"Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
Leonard,We’re not playing. This is real work.
Leonard,"Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig."
Leonard,"Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up."
Leonard,"Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app."
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
Leonard,I think her weekend just opened up.
Leonard,Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
Leonard,"Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
Leonard,They’re bigger than mine.
Leonard,I can vouch for that.
Leonard,"Not you, him."
Leonard,Although yours was an eye-opener.
Leonard,Are you an element in the actinoid series?
Leonard,"It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor."
Leonard,Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Uh, sure."
Leonard,"So, how do you wanna do this?"
Leonard,"Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin."
Leonard,"Okay, when you say make the best of it."
Leonard,Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
Leonard,"Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire."
Leonard,"Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
Leonard,"Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Sure, no problem."
Leonard,True dat.
Leonard,I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
Leonard,"No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off."
Leonard,"I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies."
Leonard,"Okay, good night."
Leonard,"Penny’s here.  No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!"
Leonard,I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
Leonard,No!
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,No. Why do you ask?
Leonard,"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect."
Leonard,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces."
Leonard,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
Leonard,Read this woman’s tweet.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"In a word, triumphant."
Leonard,Really? Triumphant?
Leonard,"I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
Leonard,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
Leonard,I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
Leonard,"Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition."
Leonard,Have you seen him?
Leonard,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
Leonard,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
Leonard,"I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
Leonard,"Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock."
Leonard,Are you sure this is right?
Leonard,Oh. We should get going.
Leonard,Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,More than this?
Leonard,He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
Leonard,Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
Leonard,Coffee maker?
Leonard,"On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
Leonard,"Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
Leonard,"Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up."
Leonard,You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,"Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
Leonard,"Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics."
Leonard,That was a great meal.
Leonard,The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
Leonard,"You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
Leonard,No kidding.
Leonard,"Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
Leonard,"Oh, good, good."
Leonard,"Terrific. Great. What level is that?  Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
Leonard,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
Leonard,"Um, I’m not sure."
Leonard,"Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
Leonard,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
Leonard,She hit on me.
Leonard,I think so.
Leonard,"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her."
Leonard,"Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen."
Leonard,"I repeat, not gonna happen."
Leonard,I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
Leonard,What’s this?
Leonard,I am not going to have sex with her.
Leonard,Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
Leonard,"Good night, Sheldon."
Leonard,Hey. Hi.
Leonard,"I’m very hungry. For food, right?"
Leonard,"No, that’s okay."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Oh. Then what was last night about?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman."
Leonard,"No, it’s true."
Leonard,"I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?"
Leonard,I hadn’t really given it much thought.
Leonard,Do you mean?
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"No, I didn’t do it for the money."
Leonard,"No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first."
Leonard,"Uh, I’m gonna go lie down."
Leonard,I didn’t do it for the money!
Leonard,"Hey, what’s up?"
Leonard,"Uh, sure. Why?"
Leonard,Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
Leonard,Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Wait, wait. What?"
Leonard,Priya’s in town?
Leonard,Hold on. When did Priya get here?
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye."
Leonard,It’s Leonard.
Leonard,I just want to talk to her.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,Why didn’t you call?
Leonard,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
Leonard,The word is forbade.
Leonard,"Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
Leonard,"I love the way you say, I’d love that."
Leonard,My sister’s 38 and married.
Leonard,"Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?"
Leonard,"Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail."
Leonard,Whose tongue?
Leonard,"What, with my tongue in your tail?"
Leonard,"Okay, I’m out of here."
Leonard,I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
Leonard,Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
Leonard,Just come with me to Raj’s.
Leonard,"It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
Leonard,How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
Leonard,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?"
Leonard,I guess you’re right. See you later.
Leonard,Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
Leonard,I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
Leonard,"What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
Leonard,Ugh!
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"Oh, sounds great."
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,Just sit here.
Leonard,What you doing?
Leonard,You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
Leonard,You’re having people over?
Leonard,Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
Leonard,"Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek."
Leonard,Of course. Good night.
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,It certainly is.
Leonard,I am leaving.
Leonard,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Leonard,Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
Leonard,This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
Leonard,I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
Leonard,"Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets."
Leonard,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
Leonard,"Hear, hear."
Leonard,"Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
Leonard,He kind of does.
Leonard,"Aw, hell, I miss him."
Leonard,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
Leonard,Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
Leonard,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?"
Leonard,"Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
Leonard,"Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that."
Leonard,I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
Leonard,"Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
Leonard,Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
Leonard,Sorry! Oop!
Leonard,"Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts."
Leonard,"Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago."
Leonard,Just two. Everyday and dress.
Leonard,"Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel."
Leonard,"Oh, okay. So, what’s up?"
Leonard,"I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
Leonard,"Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends."
Leonard,"No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay.
Leonard,"No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it."
Leonard,"Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry. I’m, never mind."
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,No?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
Leonard,"Yeah, bitches are the worst."
Leonard,"Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?"
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
Leonard,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
Leonard,"Sure, that has birds in it."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that."
Leonard,Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Leonard,"Oh, yes. Indeed, I did."
Leonard,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
Leonard,"Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are."
Leonard,"Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon."
Leonard,Yep.
Leonard, Nope.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
Leonard,What’s up with the infrared cameras?
Leonard,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime."
Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here."
Leonard,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
Leonard,"Or as you probably call it back home, food."
Leonard,"No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
Leonard,Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
Leonard,Small world.
Leonard,"Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked."
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,It is pretty spicy.
Leonard,"Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait."
Leonard,"Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with."
Leonard,Move out.
Leonard,"Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools."
Leonard,"Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
Leonard,"Yes. There, I said it."
Leonard,And she likes you.
Leonard,"Not really, no."
Leonard,"Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
Leonard,"I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing."
Leonard,"Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
Leonard,No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
Leonard,"Penny, wait.  Damned contacts."
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,"Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?"
Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did they get?"
Leonard,You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
Leonard,"Oh, no, not Glenn?"
Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
Leonard,Not the kind with access to drugs.
Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
Leonard,"I’m really sorry, Sheldon."
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,"I’m on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
Leonard,"Okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
Leonard,"Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
Leonard,"Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
Leonard,We got him. We’re almost done.
Leonard,"Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
Leonard,That’s not where it was going.
Leonard,"Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?"
Leonard,"Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens."
Leonard,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
Leonard,"Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?"
Leonard,That’s a relief.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
Leonard,"Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?"
Leonard,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?"
Leonard,No one’s getting tortured.
Leonard,"Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row."
Leonard,"Aw, screw it. I’m in."
Leonard,That’s incredible.
Leonard,"Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye."
Leonard,Cover for me.
Leonard,I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
Leonard,Totally.
Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go."
Leonard,"Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Come on.
Leonard,"You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. "
Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Oh-oh.
Leonard,"Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
Leonard,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
Leonard,"Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up."
Leonard,"Uh, I kind of told her I was working."
Leonard,"Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Nice shot.
Leonard,Perfect.
Leonard,Shooting at a target?
Leonard,An arrow.
Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Sheldon."
Leonard,Really? How could you tell?
Leonard,You don’t say?
Leonard,"So, what’s the gossip?"
Leonard,"Fine, don’t tell me."
Leonard,Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
Leonard,"Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games."
Leonard,"– Priya, can I come in?"
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
Leonard,Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
Leonard,It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
Leonard,"I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges."
Leonard,"Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape."
Leonard,"Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?"
Leonard,"Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
Leonard,"Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
Leonard,"Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him."
Leonard,Really? Who?
Leonard,What? You’re kidding!
Leonard,"Wow, that’s hard to believe."
Leonard,"Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit."
Leonard,Hey!
Leonard,Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
Leonard,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
Leonard,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
Leonard,I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I can’t say.
Leonard,"Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship."
Leonard,You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? What about it?"
Leonard,Lucky bastard.
Leonard,"Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything."
Leonard,Marry you?
Leonard,"Oh, I’d wait."
Leonard,"Man, he’s going to be blindsided."
Leonard,"Yeah, Raj, why?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Hope you’re hungry.
Leonard,Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
Leonard,"Good, good. Everything okay between you two?"
Leonard,"No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
Leonard,No. That’s not what he meant.
Leonard,"Yeah, you do. You dog, you."
Leonard,Pass the soy sauce.
Leonard,"Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times."
Leonard,Congratulations!
Leonard,That’s great.
Leonard,You’re pregnant?
Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
Leonard,What kind of emergency?
Leonard,You might not want to do that.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not alone in here."
Leonard,"We were in here first, you can’t be in here."
Leonard,"Yeah, fine."
Leonard,Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
Leonard,"Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face."
Leonard,Schooled!
Leonard,Superceded!
Leonard,"No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
Leonard,I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
Leonard,Not as much as you.
Leonard,I got you the lamb kabob.
Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
Leonard,Why would I want to do that?
Leonard,"Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
Leonard,"What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
Leonard,What’s the big deal?
Leonard,"They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
Leonard,Are you ashamed of me?
Leonard,Then why can’t we tell your parents?
Leonard,"No, he’s bluffing."
Leonard,It’s blackmail!
Leonard,This is ridiculous. 
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Okay, I’ll sign it!"
Leonard,"Okay, see you later."
Leonard,That is good news. Bye.
Leonard,"That, that’s brilliant."
Leonard,"Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?"
Leonard,All right.
Leonard,Elegant.
Leonard,"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
Leonard,And what?
Leonard,"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
Leonard,Got it. Bye.
Leonard,You okay?
Leonard,Very pretty.
Leonard,Hadn’t really thought about it.
Leonard,"Uh, sure. Very… prominent."
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,Yeah. How did you know?
Leonard,"Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
Leonard,Really? In front of your sister?
Leonard,You’re kidding. 3-D?
Leonard,Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
Leonard,"Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?"
Leonard,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
Leonard,"I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t."
Leonard,I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
Leonard,"Thanks, yeah."
Leonard,"Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
Leonard,I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
Leonard,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
Leonard,"Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon."
Leonard,"Uh, that’s my water."
Leonard,My water. You’re drinking it.
Leonard,Yes. It’s my water.
Leonard,Here we go.
Leonard,That’s actually my napkin.
Leonard,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
Leonard,You all right?
Leonard,Water nymph.
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
Leonard,That’s not your water.
Leonard,"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go."
Leonard,"I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry."
Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go!"
Leonard,"Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his."
Leonard,"So, how is she?"
Leonard,Go sit over there.
Leonard,Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
Leonard,I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
Leonard,"No, I do not. You are a mean little man."
Leonard,"There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…"
Leonard,"Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her."
Leonard,"Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off."
Leonard,I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
Leonard,I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
Leonard,There was one time I put body glitter on.
Leonard,"No, she wouldn’t."
Leonard,You really are a mean little man.
Leonard,"Hey, what took you guys so long?"
Leonard,That’s nice. What about?
Leonard,That’s funny.
Leonard,It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
Leonard,Hell Hounds.
Leonard,Sure
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t."
Leonard,"Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon."
Leonard,"So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?"
Leonard,Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
Leonard,Kill me.
Leonard,"So, what’s your news, Bernadette?"
Leonard,"So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?"
Leonard,"Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?"
Leonard,"Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor."
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,In my bed?
Leonard,"Oh, you heard?"
Leonard,Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?"
Leonard,We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
Leonard,"Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment."
Leonard,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
Leonard,Just not against their will.
Leonard,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
Leonard,"If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
Leonard,Until you have kids.
Leonard,"There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too."
Leonard,"Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
Leonard,No backsies.
Leonard,Mmm. Mmm.
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,"Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
Leonard,When is the time?
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,You’re moving back to India?
Leonard,When were you going to tell me about this?
Leonard,She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
Leonard,"Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up."
Leonard,So. Hot in India?
Leonard,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I live here.
Leonard,Priya’s going back to India.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,What are you grinding about?
Leonard,"Just let it go, Sheldon."
Leonard,"They slept together, Sherlock."
Leonard,She lied.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"No, I’m fine with it."
Leonard,What the hell is wrong with you?
Leonard,"Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
Leonard,"Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
Leonard,"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
Leonard,Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
Leonard,"I’m not in the mood, Sheldon."
Leonard,I don’t want to talk to Amy.
Leonard,You called my mother?
Leonard,What’s going on? What do you want?
Leonard,That’s so nice.
Leonard,"Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone."
Leonard,Got any advice?
Leonard,"Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
Leonard,"Thanks, Mother. I feel much better."
Leonard,"Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"
Leonard,"You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?"
Leonard,"Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
Leonard,"Yes, no and no."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Let’s get ’em!
Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Leonard,You’re leaving?
Leonard,"Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
Leonard,I’m proud of you.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
Leonard,"Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast."
Leonard,That doesn’t sound like mocking.
Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
Leonard,"Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
Leonard,"Yes, I’ve always admired that about you."
Leonard,"Oh, good."
Leonard,A hobby?
Leonard,"You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
Leonard,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
Leonard,Of course I like Amy.
Leonard,"Excuse me, that’s Priya."
Leonard,"Hey, honey."
Leonard,"Oh, I miss you, too."
Leonard,That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
Leonard,Yep.
Leonard,"Not easy, but we’re making it work."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
Leonard,I can’t do that.
Leonard,"I did it last night, I’m not doing it again."
Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
Leonard,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
Leonard,It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
Leonard,"So, here we are. Back in bed together."
Leonard,"Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in."
Leonard,"Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?"
Leonard,Not good?
Leonard,"Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!"
Leonard,Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
Leonard,"Okay, like usual. Good."
Leonard,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
Leonard,"Yes, ma’am."
Leonard,"Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!"
Leonard,Cool.  Uh-oh!
Leonard,"Oh, damn it!"
Leonard,"No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
Leonard,"So, how are your mom and dad?"
Leonard,"Yeah. Sure, sure."
Leonard,Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
Leonard,"I don’t know about this, Howard."
Leonard,I don’t think so.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out."
Leonard,"No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
Leonard,"That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you."
Leonard,Who wants the last dumpling?
Leonard,Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
Leonard,"Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…"
Leonard,Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
Leonard,All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
Leonard,Amy?
Leonard,You okay?
Leonard,I thought you were reading.
Leonard,"I, I’m fine."
Leonard,"What, who told you that?"
Leonard,"Well, you stay as long as you’d like."
Leonard,"It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
Leonard,Not really. Is that my yearbook?
Leonard,"Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that."
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,"Rough night, Casey Jones?"
Leonard,What’s in the bag?
Leonard,"Ah, sure. That’d be nice."
Leonard,Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
Leonard,Ready.
Leonard,"Amy, this is for you."
Leonard,"No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer."
Leonard,I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
Leonard,"That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…"
Leonard,"Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
Leonard,I’m not moody. I’m fun.
Leonard,"Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are."
Leonard,"Okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
Leonard,"Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer."
Leonard,"I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
Leonard,I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
Leonard,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
Leonard,"Well, okay. Again, thank you."
Leonard,"Want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
Leonard,"Okay. Well, good night."
Leonard,Sounds like you had a great night.
Leonard,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
Leonard,"Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?"
Leonard,"See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want."
Leonard,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
Leonard,Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
Leonard,"Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?"
Leonard,"Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
Leonard,Are we ready to order?
Leonard,Do you really want that?
Leonard,"You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
Leonard,"Yeah, every night for the last month."
Leonard,You think she’s taking advantage of him?
Leonard,Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
Leonard,Could you tell us?
Leonard,"Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much."
Leonard,"Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much."
Leonard,"Yeah, real big of you."
Leonard,It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
Leonard,What did you have in mind?
Leonard,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
Leonard,"Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
Leonard,Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
Leonard,"Yeah. It’s okay, I guess."
Leonard,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s pretty steep."
Leonard,Hang on. Can you do any better?
Leonard,Slow down. Two hundred.
Leonard,Will you shut up?
Leonard,Nope. Maybe another time.
Leonard,Two hundred.
Leonard,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten."
Leonard,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
Leonard,"No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I was actually thinking about going.
Leonard,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
Leonard,"Sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
Leonard,Can you or can’t you?
Leonard,"It never is, is it?"
Leonard,Got it. Can I have my water?
Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
Leonard,"For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
Leonard,"You never stop talking, do you?"
Leonard,"Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
Leonard,"I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
Leonard,Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
Leonard,I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance."
Leonard,You want to drive?
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him."
Leonard,"I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,Can we get autographed dolls?
Leonard,Ten.
Leonard,Twelve.
Leonard,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
Leonard,So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
Leonard,What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
Leonard,"Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook."
Leonard,"All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
Leonard,What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
Leonard,"Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that, too."
Leonard,"It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
Leonard,"Please pester her. Please, for me."
Leonard,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
Leonard,Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
Leonard,"Raj, what are you doing?"
Leonard,"We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list."
Leonard,You want some Oreos?
Leonard,"No, regular."
Leonard,These are delicious.
Leonard,Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
Leonard,I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
Leonard,Sorry. Syrup.
Leonard,I hadn’t…
Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers."
Leonard,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
Leonard,"Oh, I’m not sure we should."
Leonard,"Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great."
Leonard,Here.
Leonard,Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
Leonard,"Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
Leonard,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy."
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,"Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
Leonard,Leonard.
Leonard,"Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess."
Leonard,"Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?"
Leonard,"Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis."
Leonard,"No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend."
Leonard,How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
Leonard,"Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?"
Leonard,"Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important."
Leonard,"Hang on.  You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey."
Leonard,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
Leonard,"Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats."
Leonard,No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
Leonard,You’re kidding. You have your own book?
Leonard,"Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?"
Leonard,You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… 
Leonard,You can have my car.
Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,No. Lactose. Gas.
Leonard,No. Sulfites. Migraines.
Leonard,"Okay, we used to go out, right?"
Leonard,"I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
Leonard,"So, you’re okay talking about this?"
Leonard,You’re sure it’s not weird.
Leonard,"You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
Leonard,Come on.
Leonard,"I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common."
Leonard,No. We just made out a little.
Leonard,"Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
Leonard,"Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
Leonard,"The problem is, I want to be one of those guys."
Leonard,"Oh, that’s not who I am."
Leonard,"Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot."
Leonard,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
Leonard,Now we’re getting somewhere.
Leonard,Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. "
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind."
Leonard,No. I’m having a moral crisis.
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India."
Leonard,"Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."
Leonard,That actually does help.
Leonard,"Screw it, I’m going."
Leonard,Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this."
Leonard,"No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to."
Leonard,But I kind of have a girlfriend.
Leonard,"You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
Leonard,"Wait, I don’t, which part?"
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy."
Leonard,It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
Leonard,"Hey, Priya."
Leonard,"Uh, not so good. We have to talk."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry."
Leonard,It is?
Leonard,"Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
Leonard,"Uh, kind of?"
Leonard,"No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot."
Leonard,"Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this."
Leonard,"Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
Leonard,"This time, it’s your fault."
Leonard,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
Leonard,"No, it’s not gonna do it."
Leonard,"Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up."
Leonard,"Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air."
Leonard,Did you try calling her on the telephone?
Leonard,"If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
Leonard,I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
Leonard,You do?
Leonard,Forget about the bobcat.
Leonard,"Uh, she’s your friend. Step up."
Leonard, Amy. Bye.
Leonard,"I’m single, I don’t need this crap."
Leonard,For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
Leonard,Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
Leonard,Moo-shu is Penny.
Leonard,"Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
Leonard,"Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
Leonard,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
Leonard,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,Really? Amy?
Leonard,"Hi, Amy."
Leonard,Cuddles?
Leonard,"Amy, what are you doing here?"
Leonard,"Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
Leonard,Maybe we should get you home.
Leonard,"Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
Leonard,Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
Leonard,"Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?"
Leonard,Not really.
Leonard,Star Wars on Blu-ray.
Leonard,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
Leonard,"I know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
Leonard,Really? Do we do that?
Leonard,"You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
Leonard,Sounds like most of my dates.
Leonard,"Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. "
Leonard,What the hell is going on?
Leonard,"Movies, yes."
Leonard,"Sheldon, just ignore him."
Leonard,The bird’s still there?
Leonard,I don’t know. Scree-scree.
Leonard,Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
Leonard,I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
Leonard,"No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t."
Leonard,Are we overthinking this?
Leonard,You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America."
Leonard,Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
Leonard,"Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see."
Leonard,"No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
Leonard,I hate those movies.
Leonard,"Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
Leonard,All the time.
Leonard,"Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?"
Leonard,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
Leonard,"See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."
Leonard,Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
Leonard,"Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
Leonard,I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
Leonard,"Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
Leonard,"No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?"
Leonard,"Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?"
Leonard,Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
Leonard,"Uh, right."
Leonard,"You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?"
Leonard,I know what you’re doing.
Leonard,You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
Leonard,"Come on, he’s not that cute."
Leonard,I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
Leonard,"If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?"
Leonard,I’m serious. I’ll do it.
Leonard,They’re in a group. I’m scared.
Leonard,"Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."
Leonard,"No, it’s fine. You can ditch away."
Leonard,It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
Leonard,"Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
Leonard,Yep.
Leonard,"Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them."
Leonard,That’s kind of between me and…
Leonard,Laura.
Leonard,"Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
Leonard,"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Spell asthma."
Leonard,"Maybe I’m not done hanging out with…  You’re right, it’s getting late."
Leonard,"Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
Leonard,"I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry."
Leonard,"Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
Leonard,Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?"
Leonard,"You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be."
Leonard,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
Leonard,"It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
Leonard,"Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?"
Leonard,Couple of weirdos. Why?
Leonard,Sure. I guess.
Leonard,I hate all of you and myself. Three.
Leonard,"Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward."
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy."
Leonard,No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
Leonard,You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
Leonard,"All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
Leonard,I am not washed-up.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
Leonard,"Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
Leonard,You okay?
Leonard,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
Leonard,Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
Leonard,It’s you.
Leonard,"Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack."
Leonard,"With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?"
Leonard,You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
Leonard,"Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
Leonard,That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
Leonard,I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
Leonard,You want to hear something weird?
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,"Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her."
Leonard,"There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks."
Leonard,"Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,"No, that was a different guy."
Leonard,"No, that was a different, different guy."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,I told you. That was a different guy.
Leonard,It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
Leonard,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,I didn’t have clams.
Leonard,"It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
Leonard,"You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”"
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"You know, I can really do this by myself."
Leonard,"No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head."
Leonard,You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
Leonard,Scrotum.
Leonard,"Uh, stapled."
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,"Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
Leonard,"I’m doing okay, I guess."
Leonard,The Newcomb medal.
Leonard,"Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot."
Leonard,"Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
Leonard,What’s the idea?
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got this."
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
Leonard,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
Leonard,It wasn’t fun for me.
Leonard,"Come on, guys."
Leonard,"Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."
Leonard,Here’s your cocoa.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,You got one for good luck.  I’ll get it.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,Laxative.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy."
Leonard,Are you okay to drive?
Leonard,"No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
Leonard,You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
Leonard,"Yeah, just back there."
Leonard,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
Leonard,"Morning, Jimmy."
Leonard,"Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology."
Leonard,For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
Leonard,That’s my French toast.
Leonard,I might kill him right now.
Leonard,"Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go."
Leonard,"No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now."
Leonard,"I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh."
Leonard,"Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?"
Leonard,Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
Leonard,"Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party."
Leonard,"Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie."
Leonard,"Next time, you should open with that."
Leonard,"Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?"
Leonard,How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
Leonard,Some people go outside and do that.
Leonard,You want to talk about it?
Leonard,You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
Leonard,Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
Leonard,"No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women."
Leonard,That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
Leonard,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
Leonard,I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
Leonard,"Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
Leonard,Glad I could help.
Leonard,"There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
Leonard,What are you gonna do?
Leonard,"You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them."
Leonard,It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
Leonard,"Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back."
Leonard,"You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?"
Leonard,"Okay, let’s talk about that."
Leonard,"We all do. Now, how about dinner?"
Leonard,"Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
Leonard,"Not like a date, a date."
Leonard,"Okay, how do I look?"
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,"I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship."
Leonard,"Oh, boy, do I?"
Leonard,Where on earth did you get that from?
Leonard,That doesn’t make it true.
Leonard,See you later.
Leonard,"So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
Leonard,"Yeah, that sounds right."
Leonard,"Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes."
Leonard,"So, Polly, tell me about yourself."
Leonard,"Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward."
Leonard,"Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
Leonard,"Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal."
Leonard,"Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds."
Leonard,"Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer."
Leonard,Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
Leonard,"Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, what did I say?"
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
Leonard,"So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you."
Leonard,I have feelings for you.
Leonard,"No, it’s not. Always made it worse."
Leonard,"No, I’m not."
Leonard,Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
Leonard,"Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking."
Leonard,"Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question."
Leonard,You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
Leonard,What does she want from me now?  What’s up?
Leonard,I don’t understand.
Leonard,"Okay, but earlier it seemed like…"
Leonard,Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
Leonard,"Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp."
Leonard,"Well, there was a lot at stake."
Leonard,"Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?"
Leonard,"Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
Leonard,Why? What are you afraid of?
Leonard,What if I dump you?
Leonard,"Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
Leonard,Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
Leonard,And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
Leonard,I can’t believe you kept this.
Leonard,That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?"
Leonard,"Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
Leonard,"Yeah, well, so was I."
Leonard,"Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one."
Leonard,"The, the gas station across the street."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I don’t want beef jerky.
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
Leonard,"Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other."
Leonard,"See, she knew what always meant."
Leonard,I’m just making a point.
Leonard,"Oh, that is not true."
Leonard,Well…
Leonard,Unbelievable. 
Leonard,"Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?"
Leonard,You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. 
Leonard,Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
Leonard,What are we doing?
Leonard,Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
Leonard,What? Yeah.
Leonard,"I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes."
Leonard,"Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
Leonard,"Yes, and I think we should go anyway."
Leonard,"Excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
Leonard,Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
Leonard,"Me, too, I missed you."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?"
Leonard,"Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off."
Leonard,"How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
Leonard,"Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
Leonard,"Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…"
Leonard,"No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good."
Leonard,"Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange."
Leonard,"Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back."
Leonard,"Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no."
Leonard,Even Doctor Who?
Leonard,"Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity."
Leonard,"Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here."
Leonard,My bug report to you.
Leonard,It’s colour coded.
Leonard,"Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?"
Leonard,"So, have a good night."
Leonard,"Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
Leonard,Hey. You ready to go?
Leonard,Can you finish it later?
Leonard,Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
Leonard,"They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here."
Leonard,I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
Leonard,You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sorry."
Leonard,Right. Sorry.
Leonard,I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
Leonard,"So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass."
Leonard,Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
Leonard,Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
Leonard,"So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have."
Leonard,Aaargh. What the hell?
Leonard,"Oh, no, come on!"
Leonard,I have to get a lock for my door.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California."
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,"Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People."
Leonard,"I don’t know, what am I doing?"
Leonard,Aah!
Leonard,Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
Leonard,Uh-huh.
Leonard,"You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
Leonard,"Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?"
Leonard,"Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist."
Leonard,"You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
Leonard,I don’t care. I’m done.
Leonard,"I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes."
Leonard,Where do I sign?
Leonard,There. Done.
Leonard,I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
Leonard,‘Sup?
Leonard,"That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz."
Leonard,"Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan."
Leonard,"No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
Leonard,"Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist."
Leonard,Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
Leonard,Why is that good?
Leonard,What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
Leonard,"It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon."
Leonard,To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
Leonard,"I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
Leonard,I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
Leonard,Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
Leonard,"Fine, what is it?"
Leonard,"S’mores, huh? Good for you."
Leonard,"No, thanks. I’m good."
Leonard,"No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself."
Leonard,"No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
Leonard,"Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
Leonard,I thought you said candles were dangerous.
Leonard,"Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
Leonard,"That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
Leonard,You say thank you.
Leonard,It’s not crazy.
Leonard,I kind of like the sound of that.
Leonard,"So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?"
Leonard,Can I sit in your spot?
Leonard,Can I control the thermostat?
Leonard,Do I get a card?
Leonard,"Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Five.
Leonard,Positive.
Leonard,It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
Leonard,"Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
Leonard,Told ya.
Leonard,"That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…"
Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
Leonard,What are you doing hiding back there?
Leonard,Lobster traps?
Leonard,What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
Leonard,"Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there."
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,"Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there."
Leonard,"It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway."
Leonard,Wow. That’s rough.
Leonard,"Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?"
Leonard,"Joke all you want, but you think about it."
Leonard,Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
Leonard,Where’s Howard?
Leonard,"I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?"
Leonard,Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
Leonard,I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
Leonard,"Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something."
Leonard,"Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
Leonard,What are you gonna do?
Leonard,What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
Leonard,Can’t be very long.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,You just called dibs.
Leonard,What’s he doing here?
Leonard,"H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?"
Leonard,It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
Leonard,"All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?"
Leonard,Balls in the basket. 
Leonard,You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
Leonard,I get it.
Leonard,"No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office."
Leonard,"No. No, I’m not."
Leonard,"All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else."
Leonard,"Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office."
Leonard,"All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three."
Leonard,"Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Why is there a hole here?
Leonard,"Sheldon, relax."
Leonard,"If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?"
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Leonard,Hang in there. I’ll be right back. 
Leonard,I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
Leonard,"Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,There’s no such thing as haircut records.
Leonard,Have you ever seen them?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it."
Leonard,"When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
Leonard,Sure. What are you doing?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
Leonard,"So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, be nice."
Leonard,Hmm.
Leonard,"You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you."
Leonard,"Like I said, complicated game."
Leonard,"Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’s crazy."
Leonard,Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
Leonard,I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
Leonard,Great. What are you going to do first?
Leonard,"I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him."
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning."
Leonard,I was sleeping.
Leonard,"No, he doesn’t."
Leonard,Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
Leonard,"Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos."
Leonard,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
Leonard,"Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning."
Leonard,"W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
Leonard,Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
Leonard,"No, it was called for."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, duh, what?"
Leonard,What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise."
Leonard,"Good point, I’m in."
Leonard,"You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
Leonard,It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
Leonard,"All right, let’s do it."
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon"
Leonard,We are going to play the online game.
Leonard,"We’ll miss you, Sheldon."
Leonard,I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
Leonard,That’s what your father used to say?
Leonard,"Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed."
Leonard,"Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
Leonard,"I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little."
Leonard,Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
Leonard,Ay papi? What is that?
Leonard,"Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?"
Leonard,Uh-uh.
Leonard,"Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once."
Leonard,You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
Leonard,"Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
Leonard,"Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it."
Leonard,"Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it’s still funny."
Leonard,"Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail."
Leonard,"All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot."
Leonard,"Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding."
Leonard,Who you bringing?
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m glad."
Leonard,"Sure, what’s up?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
Leonard,Prove it.
Leonard,Who’s there?
Leonard,Interrupting physi…
Leonard,Where did you get that?
Leonard,You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
Leonard,"Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box."
Leonard,Awesome!
Leonard,Ah!
Leonard,They’re Collectables.
Leonard,Once you open the box it loses its value.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Really? I don’t even notice any more.
Leonard,"Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box."
Leonard,"You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it."
Leonard,It’s broken.
Leonard,Absolutely.
Leonard,Why would you open mine?
Leonard,"Well, you should talk to Stuart."
Leonard,"Okay, that I believe."
Leonard,"So, is that one mine."
Leonard,"Well, hand it over so I can open it."
Leonard,"And that’s a lie, right?"
Leonard,You’re kidding.
Leonard,"That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him."
Leonard,"Yeah, he worships Hawking."
Leonard,"Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee."
Leonard,Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Still going to introduce him?
Leonard,"So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?"
Leonard,"Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?"
Leonard,What if he doesn’t?
Leonard,You do realize you own his ass right now.
Leonard,What are these?
Leonard,It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
Leonard,Give it a second. 
Leonard,"Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth."
Leonard,"Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body."
Leonard,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
Leonard,"No, he didn’t."
Leonard,"Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special."
Leonard,"Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
Leonard,"Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about."
Leonard,"Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?"
Leonard,"Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
Leonard,"Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen."
Leonard,"You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s."
Leonard,"Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
Leonard,Are you drinking whisky?
Leonard,"Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no worries."
Leonard,"Oh, all right."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,"Wow, that’s very nice."
Leonard,Sheldon…
Leonard,"So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…"
Leonard,Right. To Howard.
Leonard,I totally had sex in the ocean.
Leonard,"Actually, you did do one of them together."
Leonard,"Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women."
Leonard,"No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?"
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,"Come on, please."
Leonard,"Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
Leonard,Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
Leonard,"All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?"
Leonard,"No, it should be: why are you?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going."
Leonard,"Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians."
Leonard,"When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?"
Leonard,You must be burning up.
Leonard,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
Leonard,"Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.  "
Leonard,Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
Leonard,Just try it.
Leonard,I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
Leonard,Mm-hmm.
Leonard,"Oh, great."
Leonard,"And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
Leonard,So we won’t let it get weird.
Leonard,What about  Cookies!
Leonard,"I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!"
Leonard,"I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time."
Leonard,It was the heat of the moment.
Leonard,"I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance."
Leonard,"Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back."
Leonard,"Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?"
Leonard,"No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny."
Leonard,Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
Leonard,"Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?"
Leonard,"Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
Leonard,We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
Leonard,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny."
Leonard,"I guess we are. So, what’s going on?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
Leonard,Shame on her.
Leonard,She’s good.
Leonard,"You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
Leonard,"Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Pretty much.
Leonard,Hey. Off to work?
Leonard,Have a nice night.
Leonard,"Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night."
Leonard,I noticed you never answered me.
Leonard,"Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?"
Leonard,Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
Leonard,I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
Leonard,I played that pretty well. 
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?"
Leonard,"There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan."
Leonard,That’s so great. 
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun."
Leonard,Where’d you get a beer?
Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
Leonard,"She said no, can we drop it now?"
Leonard,"What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?"
Leonard,Will you shut up?
Leonard,That’s so cool.
Leonard,How about our roof?
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Leonard,I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
Leonard,"Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start."
Leonard,Hmm.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Hey, I didn’t say it."
Leonard,"Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
Leonard,"No, come on in. Hurry."
Leonard,This is it.
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way."
Leonard,"You know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine."
Leonard,"Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity."
Leonard,"Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…"
Leonard,I know what the anthropic principle is.
Leonard,Where do you stand on it? 
Leonard,"Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?"
Leonard,"Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?"
Leonard,"No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you."
Leonard,"I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach."
Leonard,"Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous."
Leonard,"Good, I’m glad. "
Leonard,Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
Leonard,"So, where exactly are we in this relationship?"
Leonard,"You’re right, I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game. "
Leonard,"I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets."
Leonard,"Absolutely. You’re the girl, I’m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here."
Leonard,"Oh, I’ll get it. Go sports."
Leonard,What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
Leonard,"Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about."
Leonard,I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.
Leonard,I’m good.
Leonard,That’s great. Get out.
Leonard,Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
Leonard,Some people might say it was romantic.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it."
Leonard,"So, is it everything you hoped it would be?"
Leonard,Go ahead.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not in charge."
Leonard,"It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
Leonard,I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,I wish there were more.
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
Leonard,"Okay, I think I understand."
Leonard,"The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?
Leonard,Gelatinous Sphere.
Leonard,Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
Leonard,You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
Leonard,"Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice."
Leonard,What’s your point?
Leonard,This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
Leonard,"So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning."
Leonard,"Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream."
Leonard,I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
Leonard,You okay? You seem a little distracted.
Leonard,"Oh. Yeah, okay."
Leonard,Just say it.
Leonard,Mm-hmm.
Leonard,"Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box."
Leonard,"No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no."
Leonard,I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
Leonard,"So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?"
Leonard,Not gonna happen.
Leonard,"If you want help, just hire a grad student."
Leonard,You talk to Howard lately?
Leonard,Smooth. Hi.
Leonard,"Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?"
Leonard,"Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj."
Leonard,She seems nice.
Leonard,All I said was she seems nice.
Leonard,This should be fun.
Leonard,Oh!
Leonard,"Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?"
Leonard,Given her what?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Please join us."
Leonard,"So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?"
Leonard,"Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about."
Leonard,"No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity."
Leonard,"Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over."
Leonard,High-energy lasers.
Leonard,"Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye."
Leonard,"No, Raj had to go to the nurse."
Leonard,"Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt."
Leonard,Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
Leonard,What do you got?
Leonard,"Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking."
Leonard,Where are we going?
Leonard,It’ll be good to have him back.
Leonard,"I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store."
Leonard,"All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?"
Leonard,"Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman."
Leonard,In what universe is that a present?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Nothing with quarks.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,How could you miss that?
Leonard,Penny got it.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog."
Leonard,"A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…"
Leonard,"I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?"
Leonard,"Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game."
Leonard,En el acelerador de particulares.
Leonard,Just pick another game.
Leonard,"No good, Sheldon doesn’t float."
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s when it started."
Leonard,Uh-uh.
Leonard,I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
Leonard,I know what he looks like.
Leonard,"Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo."
Leonard,"57, 58, 59, that’s one minute."
Leonard,"Remember, show your work."
Leonard,"Get up, we can’t lose at math."
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face."
Leonard,Snort it down and keep eating!
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Open it first."
Leonard,Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
Leonard,"Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?"
Leonard,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Leonard,"Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before."
Leonard,No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
Leonard,Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there."
Leonard,"No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg."
Leonard,Sign right there.
Leonard,"Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer."
Leonard,That is a pencil sharpener.
Leonard,It’s actually pretty neat.
Leonard,"Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here."
Leonard,"Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. "
Leonard,"You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,You should visit more often. What are you doing?
Leonard,What? Here? Now?
Leonard,"No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before."
Leonard,"No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough."
Leonard,"Hello, boys."
Leonard,Nothing.
Leonard,"So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this."
Leonard,"Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?"
Leonard,A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
Leonard,Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.
Leonard,But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
Leonard,"Hello, boys."
Leonard,"Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light."
Leonard,"Sorry, Officer."
Leonard,Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
Leonard,"Don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs."
Leonard,"That’s really nice, Sheldon, I’m happy for you."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t think this actually means…"
Leonard,It’s crunchy. Just the way I like it.
Leonard,It’s great. I love it.
Leonard,"Oh. That’s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?"
Leonard,"Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it, you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."
Leonard,Sorry. Whatever. It’s all good.
Leonard,Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
Leonard,"Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political."
Leonard,Can I take a look?
Leonard,"Okay, I get it."
Leonard,"It’s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn’t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close."
Leonard,"Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once."
Leonard,Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,I did a bad thing.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn’t want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway."
Leonard,"I don’t know what to do. I mean, the paper’s terrible. But if I tell her, she’ll know that I read it and she’ll get really mad."
Leonard,Is it possible we’re having two different conversations?
Leonard,"Hang on. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We’ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin."
Leonard,"He’s probably busy. You’re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. My turn. I can’t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it’s bad without letting her know that I read it?"
Leonard,"Maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I wasn’t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she’s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren’t I allowed to help her?"
Leonard,No. You need to give me some advice.
Leonard,"No, specific to my situation."
Leonard,Empathetic.
Leonard,I quit.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Good morning, sunshine."
Leonard,"I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast."
Leonard,"Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?"
Leonard,"No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it."
Leonard,Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.
Leonard,"No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it."
Leonard,"No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing."
Leonard,"That’s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That’s all you."
Leonard,"Please don’t be upset. I just, I didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, you know that’s not true."
Leonard,I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Haven’t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?"
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
Leonard,Well answer it. I want to hear.
Leonard,"Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy."
Leonard,I thought you had plans with Amy.
Leonard,Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
Leonard,Then Amy got mad and left?
Leonard,And you?
Leonard,"Buddy, I think Amy might be upset."
Leonard,"Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him."
Leonard,"Trust me, call her."
Leonard,"Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great."
Leonard,"They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade."
Leonard,Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
Leonard,We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
Leonard,"You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays."
Leonard,"Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg."
Leonard,"Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?"
Leonard,"Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection."
Leonard,"Yeah, it was."
Leonard,Who you talking to?
Leonard,"Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral."
Leonard,"Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have."
Leonard,Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
Leonard,"Well, maybe you should tell him."
Leonard,"Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one."
Leonard,Yes. Thank you.
Leonard,What did he say?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I hate this guy.
Leonard,"Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you."
Leonard,Really? Here?
Leonard,That’d be great. Thank you.
Leonard,"If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s."
Leonard,"It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care."
Leonard,This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,"Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things."
Leonard,I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
Leonard,I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
Leonard,"None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Now you’re just being ridiculous.
Leonard,I’ll be right back.
Leonard,"You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?"
Leonard,"Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?"
Leonard,"I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude."
Leonard,Yeah. He’s ganged up.
Leonard,That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
Leonard,"No problem, brother. Stay frosty.  We’re still dating, right?"
Leonard,"Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent."
Leonard,"Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her."
Leonard,"Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that."
Leonard,"Trust me, it doesn’t."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Come on, I’m sorry."
Leonard,"I do, of course I do."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy."
Leonard,"I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours."
Leonard,You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
Leonard,We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
Leonard,"You’re right, you should go."
Leonard,They are not.
Leonard,Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages."
Leonard,"All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him."
Leonard,Good boy. Here’s a cookie.
Leonard,"Oh, mummies and zombies again."
Leonard,"You get a cookie, too."
Leonard,Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
Leonard,"Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station."
Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal."
Leonard,All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
Leonard,Because I can never understand your side.
Leonard,Sheldon?
Leonard,I don’t have any.
Leonard,"Howard, what are you doing?"
Leonard,Mmm.
Leonard,What are you idiots doing?
Leonard,You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.
Leonard,What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
Leonard,"Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
Leonard,"Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1."
Leonard,"Penny’s working tonight, I’m in."
Leonard,Fun. We know how much you love that.
Leonard,That should lighten the mood.
Leonard,Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm."
Leonard,"Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm."
Leonard,It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
Leonard,"My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid."
Leonard,"You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
Leonard,"Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands."
Leonard,"Aw, I got a little paper cut."
Leonard,"Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."
Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you."
Leonard,Would you just look inside?
Leonard,"It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme."
Leonard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place."
Leonard,"Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?"
Leonard,"Fine. Howard, what do you do?"
Leonard,And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
Leonard,"Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game."
Leonard,"Okay, come on, moving on."
Leonard,Okay…
Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon."
Leonard,"I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet."
Leonard,"Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest."
Leonard,Great. What do you do?
Leonard,"It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
Leonard,"Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."
Leonard,Walls are getting closer.
Leonard,"You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight."
Leonard,"Seven, six."
Leonard,"Three, two."
Leonard,The walls are getting slower.
Leonard,"Okay, continuing our quest."
Leonard,"Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen."
Leonard,I don’t know. What’s the difference?
Leonard,Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
Leonard,"You see those, too."
Leonard,What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
Leonard,"No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy."
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit."
Leonard,"Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now."
Leonard,"I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded."
Leonard,It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
Leonard,The drawbridge is lowering.
Leonard,"You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me."
Leonard,"Uh, okay."
Leonard,"This is weird, right?"
Leonard,"Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
Leonard,I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
Leonard,What recordings?
Leonard,Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
Leonard,"Well, most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?"
Leonard,Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.
Leonard,"Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny."
Leonard,"Well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff."
Leonard,Are we done with this?
Leonard,Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.
Leonard,Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
Leonard,Working it? You can’t even talk to her.
Leonard,She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.
Leonard,"To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods."
Leonard,I didn’t steal anyone.
Leonard,I’m androgynous?
Leonard,What do you guys think I should do?
Leonard,"Hey, pretty lady."
Leonard,"Uh, I guess I am."
Leonard,"I don’t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy."
Leonard,Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
Leonard,Oh. It. Was.
Leonard,Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,"Um, why would I mean Alex?"
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I’m missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Leonard,At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did you do?"
Leonard,Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
Leonard,Of course not. No. Why?
Leonard,You do that?
Leonard,"Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship."
Leonard,"No, I’m not happy."
Leonard,I’m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
Leonard,Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
Leonard,Come here. Tell you a secret?
Leonard,"With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Message received. Ah, excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources."
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
Leonard,How is this my fault?
Leonard,I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
Leonard,"Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding."
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,"Oh, would you stop worrying about that?"
Leonard,That’s great.
Leonard,"Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot."
Leonard,"Okay, come with me."
Leonard,"To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots."
Leonard,"Hey, will you steam my uniform next?"
Leonard,"Oh, thanks, I thought I had more."
Leonard,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend."
Leonard,That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
Leonard,"Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Oh, hang on a second. "
Leonard,To show people when they don’t believe me.
Leonard,It is on.
Leonard,"I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up."
Leonard,What did you do?
Leonard,"Counterpoint, no, it’s not."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Yeah, that sounds fun."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I’ll set the timer.
Leonard,"What? Hey, hey! Come back here!"
Leonard,I don’t believe this.
Leonard,"Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?"
Leonard,What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
Leonard,I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.
Leonard,"Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people."
Leonard,"Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen."
Leonard,"Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood."
Leonard,Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
Leonard,"Our clothes, our wallets, phones."
Leonard,"Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds."
Leonard,"Okay, he gets how cool it is."
Leonard,"Thanks, but we’ve got it covered."
Leonard,"Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home."
Leonard,"No, that can’t be right."
Leonard,I say we investigate.
Leonard,"Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again."
Leonard,"Sheldon, your food’s getting cold."
Leonard,"Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?"
Leonard,"Yeah, so, I’m out."
Leonard,You get that these are personalised action figures.
Leonard,Yep.
Leonard,Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
Leonard,A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
Leonard,Maybe it’s a shipping problem.
Leonard,Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
Leonard,"Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug."
Leonard,"Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers."
Leonard,"They could show bloopers. Oh, no."
Leonard,"That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place."
Leonard,Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
Leonard,Want me to make you some tea?
Leonard,"So, cocoa?"
Leonard,"Oh, teacher! Me! Me!"
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?"
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late."
Leonard,You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.
Leonard,128
Leonard,"What did you do, put this in your tea?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."
Leonard,"Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work."
Leonard,How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
Leonard,Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
Leonard,"I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that."
Leonard,We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.
Leonard,"All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?"
Leonard,Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
Leonard,Ow!
Leonard,I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
Leonard,Why would you say that?
Leonard,That was a huge spoiler.
Leonard,"What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks."
Leonard,Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
Leonard,"You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating."
Leonard,"You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met."
Leonard,"That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this."
Leonard,Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.
Leonard,"To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met."
Leonard,"Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute."
Leonard,I was thinking here with you.
Leonard,That a problem?
Leonard,He’s got Amy now.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Harry and Ginny get together?
Leonard,"Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat."
Leonard,Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
Leonard,"Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Great. I’ll go get my stuff.
Leonard,"Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine."
Leonard,What do you want?
Leonard,Is that so?
Leonard,"Cut to the chase, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him."
Leonard,"Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?"
Leonard,"Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face."
Leonard,Since when don’t you want to live with me?
Leonard,‘Kay.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Hmm?
Leonard,You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
Leonard,You’re a hero.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?"
Leonard,"What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day."
Leonard,You could be a little more into it.
Leonard,"Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!"
Leonard,"Hey, you coming to lunch?"
Leonard,What you looking at?
Leonard,You can’t find a card that says that?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s cool."
Leonard,From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Leonard,"Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner."
Leonard,Want to come to dinner with us?
Leonard,"Waugh, romance ninja."
Leonard,"Mmm, would you like some wine?"
Leonard,"Uh, where what is?"
Leonard,"Trying to have a magical night here, guys."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"No, tell me."
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,You’re kidding.
Leonard,"I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night."
Leonard,That’s the spirit.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Two can play this game. Penny…
Leonard,All right.
Leonard,"Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person."
Leonard,You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?
Leonard,I thought we were letting it go.
Leonard,"Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me."
Leonard,"Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
Leonard,"Oh, I’m not. It’s about you."
Leonard,"This one does, and you’re the reason why."
Leonard,"Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it."
Leonard,I’m not saying that.
Leonard,"Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?"
Leonard,"Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that."
Leonard,Glaringly obvious. Go on.
Leonard,Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
Leonard,"No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me."
Leonard,"Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet."
Leonard,And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
Leonard,You do?
Leonard,Yes?
Leonard,Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!
Leonard,"Don’t look under that rock.  Raj, you okay?"
Leonard,"Come on, buddy, open up."
Leonard,Whoa.
Leonard,"Nope, just, just, whoa."
Leonard,"Raj, what’s going on?"
Leonard,"Yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."
Leonard,Lobsters overnight?
Leonard,The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,"So, Amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?"
Leonard,Why? What happened?
Leonard,I’m sorry. That I asked.
Leonard,"Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets."
Leonard,You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
Leonard,"Well, is that all of it?  Just set it down."
Leonard,"She’s pretty good, huh?"
Leonard,She really is.
Leonard,"Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences."
Leonard,Helping women? Y
Leonard,"Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?"
Leonard,You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
Leonard,"You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?"
Leonard,"Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this."
Leonard,"Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith."
Leonard,"Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch."
Leonard,"Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science."
Leonard,That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?
Leonard,I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
Leonard,"That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there."
Leonard,It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
Leonard,And now you’re also an astronaut.
Leonard,"Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Leonard,"Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?"
Leonard,"Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle."
Leonard,"I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"
Leonard,"Hey, how was your… what?"
Leonard,I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
Leonard,"Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go."
Leonard,That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye."
Leonard,"You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum."
Leonard,"Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties."
Leonard,Trying to paint a picture.
Leonard,"Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up."
Leonard,Yeah. Although…
Leonard,"Actually, all I did was invite you."
Leonard,"I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres."
Leonard,"Hey, where have you been?"
Leonard,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time."
Leonard,What information?
Leonard,"Fine, then that."
Leonard,As is the company.
Leonard,"Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father."
Leonard,Same here.
Leonard,"You know, too."
Leonard,"When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution."
Leonard,"Raj, you’re up."
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,Amy.
Leonard,Penny.
Leonard,"Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did."
Leonard,Bernadette.
Leonard,"So, which one do you think it is, matey?"
Leonard,"Well, one of them is."
Leonard,"Yeah, cool."
Leonard,"Yeah, I think so."
Leonard,"I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again."
Leonard,"My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real."
Leonard,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are."
Leonard,Yup.
Leonard,"Mm, not really."
Leonard,I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
Leonard,"Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call."
Leonard,I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
Leonard,"Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?"
Leonard,Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
Leonard,Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
Leonard,"I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?"
Leonard,Right. This one might be broken.
Leonard,"Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?"
Leonard,"Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Go away.
Leonard,"Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie."
Leonard,"Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you."
Leonard,That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
Leonard,Call someone.
Leonard,Gentlemen.
Leonard,Nurse’s office.
Leonard,"Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though."
Leonard,Probably not.
Leonard,Do anything interesting today?
Leonard,"Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go."
Leonard,I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
Leonard,"Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them."
Leonard,"Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either."
Leonard,Do it.
Leonard,Way to hit ’em with both barrels.
Leonard,"Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?"
Leonard,"Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever."
Leonard,I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
Leonard,"How about it, Sheldon?"
Leonard,No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
Leonard,"Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately."
Leonard,I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.
Leonard,"You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas."
Leonard,There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
Leonard,They did.
Leonard,"Oh, please, don’t do that."
Leonard,"Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel."
Leonard,"With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?"
Leonard,I thought you grew up on a farm.
Leonard,"So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it."
Leonard,"Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst."
Leonard,It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
Leonard,"You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it."
Leonard,"Well, then, tell your face."
Leonard,You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.
Leonard,Well…
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
Leonard,"The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand."
Leonard,"Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
Leonard,Those things can still happen.
Leonard,That’s a big deal.
Leonard,"So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?"
Leonard,"The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button."
Leonard,Nice shot.
Leonard,You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
Leonard,He was the host of this great… Hey!
Leonard,It was pretty cool.
Leonard,Hire him to do what?
Leonard,"It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?"
Leonard,Do you remember his old theme song?
Leonard,You’re kidding.
Leonard,And he wrote him a cheque.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,"Well, I can, so shut up."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night."
Leonard,That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Okay, good night."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Where is he?
Leonard,"Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator."
Leonard,"Actually, he’s a genius."
Leonard,"Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny."
Leonard,"Yes, sir."
Leonard,We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
Leonard,"That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
Leonard,Then what is it?
Leonard,"I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries."
Leonard,It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
Leonard,"I’ll, I’ll call for help."
Leonard,You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
Leonard,I’m sorry things turned out this way.
Leonard,It’s gonna get crazy.
Leonard,"I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma."
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him."
Leonard,"See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am."
Leonard,"Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started."
Leonard,I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Leonard,"Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. "
Leonard,"No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun."
Leonard,"What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players."
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Leonard,"Double potion, please."
Leonard,I draw my broadsword.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out."
Leonard,"All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off."
Leonard,"Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that."
Leonard,"Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?"
Leonard,"Oh, that sounds romantic."
Leonard,"So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
Leonard,How’s that been working for you?
Leonard,I have a job.
Leonard,"Well, do you really think I have a shot?"
Leonard,"He knows, wow."
Leonard,What do you think?
Leonard,Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
Leonard,I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,"Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me."
Leonard,"Oh, that’s awful."
Leonard,"So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
Leonard,"Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them."
Leonard,"Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while."
Leonard,"Three, four months."
Leonard,Couple of weeks.
Leonard,"That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea."
Leonard,"Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory."
Leonard,"Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up."
Leonard,Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
Leonard,I do have to ask you one favour.
Leonard,Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.
Leonard,"Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
Leonard,"Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
Leonard,"There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
Leonard,"Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
Leonard,It’s not a competition.
Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say."
Leonard,Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.
Leonard,"Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good."
Leonard,Would you just relax?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,I’m covered.
Leonard,Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.
Leonard,"I love you, too."
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?"
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here."
Leonard,What was what?
Leonard,"Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… "
Leonard,"Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny."
Leonard,Best time of my life. 
Leonard,"Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!"
Leonard,"Uh-oh, hang on."
Leonard,"No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!"
Leonard,Keep your voice down.
Leonard,"We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you."
Leonard,"I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
Leonard,"Uh, sure, that’s why I did it."
Leonard,And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
Leonard,"And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in."
Leonard,Yep. Here’s some money.
Leonard,And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny."
Leonard,That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
Leonard,I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
Leonard,The what?
Leonard,"Come on, I said I was sorry."
Leonard,"Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?"
Leonard,"I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah."
Leonard,Good morning.
Leonard,So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Leonard,Where do you think I would take you?
Leonard,I’m going to work. You can come if you want.
Leonard,"No, I don’t."
Leonard,"I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell."
Leonard,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?
Leonard,"Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?"
Leonard,Fine. What I did was wrong.
Leonard,"You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying."
Leonard,Stop it.
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,"So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
Leonard,You know what? You’re a crazy person.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
Leonard,"Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
Leonard,And no one told me?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that."
Leonard,Great. 
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,"We did them at Princeton, too."
Leonard,"Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…"
Leonard,"A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
Leonard,I think it sounds fun.
Leonard,What’s all this?
Leonard,You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
Leonard,It’s not funny.
Leonard,Ha-ha.
Leonard,Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
Leonard,"I just said, couples sound great."
Leonard,"All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to."
Leonard,Stop yelling at me.
Leonard,Do you think Penny’s mad at me?
Leonard,"No, because I didn’t want her on my team."
Leonard,"Geez, I never realized you were so competitive."
Leonard,I have asthma. Back off.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings."
Leonard,"Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve."
Leonard,"Wait, I got it. I got it/"
Leonard,"You’re really mean, you know that?"
Leonard,"Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car."
Leonard,Uh-huh. Like death?
Leonard,Penny’s not answering my texts.
Leonard,This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,What does she think I am?
Leonard,I can’t believe she would say that about me.
Leonard,Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.
Leonard,Almost.
Leonard,Got it.
Leonard,"Yeah, Penny might be onto something."
Leonard,To the tar pits.
Leonard,The clue must be in the bag.
Leonard,It’s just a bunch of pants.
Leonard,"Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon."
Leonard,You know exactly what I’m talking about.
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Leonard,"Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this."
Leonard,"This one is, too."
Leonard,Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?
Leonard,Are you kidding me?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?"
Leonard,You bought my mom’s book?
Leonard,"Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
Leonard,"Seriously, please find another book."
Leonard,"There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it."
Leonard,"It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
Leonard,Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
Leonard,"Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk."
Leonard,That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house."
Leonard,"Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June."
Leonard,"I do, too, but there’s not."
Leonard,"Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it."
Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
Leonard,So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
Leonard,Mm-hmm. And?
Leonard,Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
Leonard,"Sorry, buddy."
Leonard,I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
Leonard,I gotta go.
Leonard,You ready to go?
Leonard,Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
Leonard,"Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go."
Leonard,"Nothing, I’m fine."
Leonard,No. Not everything is about my mom. 
Leonard,Except this is totally about my mom.
Leonard,That sounds nice. Yeah.
Leonard,"Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom."
Leonard,One sec. Hey. Sorry.
Leonard,"I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight."
Leonard,Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.
Leonard,Who just had sex with me at work.
Leonard,"Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better."
Leonard,"Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end."
Leonard,"I am, I’m really proud."
Leonard,"Hey, I was just… what is happening?"
Leonard,"Oh, oh, I have. So bad."
Leonard,"Uh-huh, I can already feel it working."
Leonard,Mom?
Leonard,I… uh…
Leonard,"Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy."
Leonard,I didn’t dream that?
Leonard,"Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now."
Leonard,"Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done."
Leonard,Your father’s a gynaecologist.
Leonard,"No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know."
Leonard,Please let me be there when you tell her that.
Leonard,"Please, oh, please, just let me be there."
Leonard,Nailed it.
Leonard,"So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,That was kind of icy. You two okay?
Leonard,Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.
Leonard,"It’s nine o’clock, where you been?"
Leonard,I did not.
Leonard,I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong."
Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
Leonard,Laser’s warmed up.
Leonard,"No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time."
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
Leonard,"Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
Leonard,"And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?"
Leonard,Sex doesn’t count.
Leonard,"Well, I took you there. All you did was…"
Leonard,It’s fine. And also not true.
Leonard,That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
Leonard,He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something."
Leonard,"Nope, it was better before."
Leonard,"Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
Leonard,"Yeah, definitely better before."
Leonard,"If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
Leonard,"Sheldon, that’s incredible."
Leonard,Good to know.
Leonard,"Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. "
Leonard,"Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
Leonard,"You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?"
Leonard,We’ll be there.
Leonard,I will not.
Leonard,Invite them to live with us.
Leonard,Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
Leonard,"Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count."
Leonard,"Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, is she okay?"
Leonard,"Oh, no."
Leonard,"I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made."
Leonard,"Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident."
Leonard,"Oh, rose petals."
Leonard,You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Leonard,"This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much."
Leonard,Nothing. I love it.
Leonard,"It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it."
Leonard,"No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful."
Leonard,I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
Leonard,Come here.
Leonard,Is that a pregnancy test?
Leonard,That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
Leonard,"Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Leonard,"Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him."
Leonard,He thinks there’s a difference.
Leonard,"Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"No, she’s not."
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
Leonard,What’s up?
Leonard,"Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton."
Leonard,"He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it."
Leonard,"If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting."
Leonard,Why is it odd?
Leonard,"Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes."
Leonard,"Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes."
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends."
Leonard,"Wow, you ask really hard questions."
Leonard,"Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
Leonard,"He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too."
Leonard,"Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez."
Leonard,"No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
Leonard,He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window."
Leonard,That one over there.
Leonard,Skee-Ball tickets?
Leonard,"Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
Leonard,"Yup, oh, here you go."
Leonard,Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
Leonard,"Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite."
Leonard,"Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there."
Leonard,"No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
Leonard,"Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out."
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
Leonard,"I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it."
Leonard,"I mean it, I’m going to."
Leonard,And you’re going to stay calm?
Leonard,How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.
Leonard,"So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet."
Leonard,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
Leonard,"Well, I don’t know how to do that."
Leonard,That’s stupid. Why?
Leonard,"I’m telling you, try the hanger."
Leonard,"You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,It’s called proving a point.
Leonard,"Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!"
Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
Leonard,Or it’s resolved.
Leonard,"Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me."
Leonard,There’s a principle at stake.
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me."
Leonard,"No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins."
Leonard,"No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft."
Leonard,What is that? What is that for?
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin."
Leonard,"Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?"
Leonard,"Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie."
Leonard,Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!"
Leonard,The math is all there. It’s not real.
Leonard,Were you drunk?
Leonard,I think you’re the one who fell over.
Leonard,It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
Leonard,I want to go.
Leonard,You did?
Leonard,"Wait, you went to a chapel?"
Leonard,Why? 
Leonard,"Penny, you know those are real, right?"
Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Leonard,I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
Leonard,"Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of."
Leonard,I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
Leonard,"Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack."
Leonard,"Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home."
Leonard,And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
Leonard,"Wuh, Penny."
Leonard,How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Wait, you invited him here?"
Leonard,Come on.
Leonard,I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
Leonard,"Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack."
Leonard,Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
Leonard,"Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
Leonard,Why won’t you sign it?
Leonard,You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
Leonard,That is not true.
Leonard,You’re the one who invited him here.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, too."
Leonard,Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.
Leonard,"Hey, you’re in a good mood."
Leonard,"Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist."
Leonard,"Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results."
Leonard,Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
Leonard,"No, it’s all over."
Leonard,"Well, you’re welcome."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy."
Leonard,"Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other."
Leonard,"The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science."
Leonard,Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does."
Leonard,"Fine, I’ll publish."
Leonard,"Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings."
Leonard,"These things happen all the time, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Come on, don’t give him a hard time."
Leonard,It’s not a big deal.
Leonard,"Okay, Barry, that’s enough."
Leonard,I can’t believe they kicked you out. 
Leonard,"Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out."
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,Well…
Leonard,He asked me.
Leonard,As I was saying…
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,"Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
Leonard,"Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury."
Leonard,Where?
Leonard,Is someone sick?
Leonard,"Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister."
Leonard,"All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
Leonard,And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
Leonard,"I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. "
Leonard,I love it.
Leonard,But it is what you got me last year.
Leonard,And last night.
Leonard,"Hey, buddy."
Leonard, What do you think?
Leonard,You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.  
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
Leonard,Watch me.
Leonard,"I, uh, ah, um, I…"
Leonard,You guys are making me nervous.
Leonard,I will. Excuse me.
Leonard,"Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?"
Leonard,"No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um."
Leonard,"Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?"
Leonard,"Come on, I would not have peed my pants."
Leonard,"But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life."
Leonard,"You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself."
Leonard,Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
Leonard,"Oh, hold on."
Leonard,The end.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them."
Leonard,Disagree.
Leonard,That’s enough.
Leonard,"Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?"
Leonard,"We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom."
Leonard,"Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man."
Leonard,Hang on. Why would I be fat?
Leonard,"Why can’t you be fat, too?"
Leonard,"Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there."
Leonard,"I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think."
Leonard,"Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look."
Leonard,He made you his screensaver.
Leonard,"Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix."
Leonard,"Oh, Madame Curie."
Leonard,Absolutely.
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,What? That’s great. Guys.
Leonard,That’s amazing.
Leonard,"So it, it’s just flirting?"
Leonard,"Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination."
Leonard,Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
Leonard,It’s a joke.
Leonard,No. Do you?
Leonard,I take it back. That was funny.
Leonard,I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
Leonard,"You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem."
Leonard,Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
Leonard,I’m so proud of you.
Leonard,"I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts."
Leonard,What’s wrong?
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry. "
Leonard,How you doing?
Leonard,You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
Leonard,"Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant."
Leonard,"I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things."
Leonard,"Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way."
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Honestly?
Leonard,I don’t.
Leonard,"I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly."
Leonard,"Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that."
Leonard,"That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
Leonard,Should’ve let Sheldon come.
Leonard,Hey. Can we talk?
Leonard,"That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them."
Leonard,"And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition."
Leonard,The new Star Wars movie.
Leonard,"There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
Leonard,"So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
Leonard,"Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’ll call you back."
Leonard,"Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic."
Leonard,Come on. It’s okay.
Leonard,"No, you’re not."
Leonard,"Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
Leonard,"Well, you have me."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Um…
Leonard,"Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost."
Leonard,That is not what I said.
Leonard,Really not a good time.
Leonard,"Penny, don’t."
Leonard,To my room.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes."
Leonard,That’s a good question.
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
Leonard,That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
Leonard,Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
Leonard,I know.
Leonard,"You need to let it go, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days."
Leonard,"Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now."
Leonard,It doesn’t.
Leonard,I’m gonna go talk to Penny. 
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"Look, if you want to break up, just say it."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents."
Leonard,"Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do."
Leonard,"Wow. That, that’s a big step."
Leonard,"So, well, before making any rash…"
Leonard,And I support you.
Leonard,No. You’re on vacation.
Leonard,Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, stay."
Leonard,I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me. 
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her."
Leonard,Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
Leonard,You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?"
Leonard,"You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."
Leonard,And I support you.
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Leonard,How did she get you to do yoga?
Leonard,"Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you."
Leonard,"Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?"
Leonard,"Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in."
Leonard,Can we please have some privacy?
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever."
Leonard,"I swear, I am on your side. "
Leonard,"Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified."
Leonard,"My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you. "
Leonard,"Oh, I’ve got butterflies."
Leonard,Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
Leonard,"They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…"
Leonard,"Well, this is it, this is it. This is it."
Leonard,Not yet. 
Leonard,"I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue."
Leonard,"Uh, fifteen…"
Leonard,…thousand two hundred and eleven.
Leonard,"Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left."
Leonard,Sunday’s gone.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
Leonard,Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.
Leonard,The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.
Leonard,"Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
Leonard,"Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
Leonard,"Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
Leonard,Good luck.
Leonard,"Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us."
Leonard,Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble."
Leonard,"Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940."
Leonard,"Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
Leonard,Maybe this isn’t a good idea.
Leonard,Hold on. We always do this. 
Leonard,"Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
Leonard,Even Batman breaks the rules. 
Leonard,"I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses."
Leonard,"Howard, you in on this?"
Leonard,Name one.
Leonard,A little.
Leonard,Good. This is exciting.
Leonard,"Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con."
Leonard,I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
Leonard,"Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs."
Leonard,We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Leonard,"Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties."
Leonard,"Got you a little something, too."
Leonard,"It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
Leonard,"Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go."
Leonard,"Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Leonard,"In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot."
Leonard,To the bedroom.
Leonard,"Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
Leonard,"It’s a little late, but I’ll take it."
Leonard,"Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?"
Leonard,"I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet."
Leonard,Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
Leonard,"Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. "
Leonard,No. Maybe to her.
Leonard,Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,We’re really sorry. It was an accident.
Leonard,"Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while."
Leonard,"Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?"
Leonard,"They’ve been in there, like, half an hour."
Leonard,How long should we stay?
Leonard,I saw a Thai place next door.
Leonard,How’s she doing?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Yes, thank you for all your help."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?"
Leonard,Great. What did you do?
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details."
Leonard,"No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?"
Leonard,"Well, give it a go."
Leonard,Additional data. You dog.
Leonard,"Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?"
Leonard,Moo-stache.
Leonard,Moo-stache.
Leonard,"Oh, I’m sorry."
Leonard,Sorry. How did it go?
Leonard,"I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea."
Leonard,Waah. I don’t want a table.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?"
Leonard,"Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?"
Leonard,Are you really gonna sit here all day?
Leonard,"If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway."
Leonard,I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.
Leonard,"Oh, hang on. Check your in-box."
Leonard,Huh?
Leonard,Nary an argument? Nary?
Leonard,No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
Leonard,He’s afraid the original owners will come back.
Leonard,"Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it."
Leonard,"I know, but…"
Leonard,"You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee."
Leonard,"You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it."
Leonard,That one? Damn right I like that one.
Leonard,"Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window."
Leonard,We’re not.
Leonard,"She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often."
Leonard,Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
Leonard,That.
Leonard,"Well, it’s always me, take one for the team."
Leonard,Fancy sounds like a compliment.
Leonard,"You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you."
Leonard,"Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked."
Leonard,"Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog."
Leonard,"Well, we should call her."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up."
Leonard,But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
Leonard,So why are you trying to ruin it?
Leonard,"Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours."
Leonard,"Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby."
Leonard,"But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him."
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,"Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing."
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Leonard,So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Leonard,"Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"
Leonard,"I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing."
Leonard,"No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight."
Leonard,Are we playing individual or teams?
Leonard,"Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?"
Leonard,"At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go."
Leonard,You sure you want to do this?
Leonard,"Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood."
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.
Leonard,"Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great."
Leonard,I know. I thought we’d take yours.
Leonard,"It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing."
Leonard,Don’t say anything.
Leonard,"I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car."
Leonard,"Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up."
Leonard,What do you guys want to do tonight?
Leonard,"Oh, my God, Stuart?"
Leonard,Calling 911.
Leonard,What do you mean it’s too late?
Leonard,"Oh, come on."
Leonard,"Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great."
Leonard,"Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
Leonard,I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
Leonard,So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
Leonard,Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
Leonard,"Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?"
Leonard,"Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford."
Leonard,"Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?"
Leonard,"But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up."
Leonard,"Well, you don’t go into science for the money."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
Leonard,Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,It was. By Terminator.
Leonard,"Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do."
Leonard,Putting it in my phone right now.
Leonard,"All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years."
Leonard,If only there were a solution to that.
Leonard,So go to the bathroom.
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?"
Leonard,Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
Leonard,"Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?"
Leonard,"Oh, that’s great."
Leonard,Aren’t you gonna ask?
Leonard,"Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie."
Leonard,"Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas."
Leonard,"Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?"
Leonard,What does your agent think?
Leonard,"You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?"
Leonard,"Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?"
Leonard,So it’s a family film.
Leonard,"So, are you gonna see her again?"
Leonard,You have my blessing. Go for it.
Leonard,"Okay, that’s enough."
Leonard,PS4.
Leonard,What’s up?
Leonard,"Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa."
Leonard,Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
Leonard,Were you seeing other men?
Leonard,Aren’t you gonna ask me?
Leonard,Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
Leonard,"So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
Leonard,Sounds rough.
Leonard,"Okay, this was helpful."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get."
Leonard,"What do you think about it, Sheldon?"
Leonard,"Oh, my God, you’re jealous."
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started."
Leonard,"Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?"
Leonard,"Hey, how’s dating two women going?"
Leonard,Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?"
Leonard,Are you sure you want to do this?
Leonard,"What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?"
Leonard,"So, business in the front, science in the back."
Leonard,"That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
Leonard,"It actually looks good, Sheldon."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know."
Leonard,What about loop quantum gravity?
Leonard,One of the people that lives in his head.
Leonard,"Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend."
Leonard,How you feeling?
Leonard,Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
Leonard,I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
Leonard,"After she put you to bed, she went home."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
Leonard,Sure. What’s up?
Leonard,"Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
Leonard,You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
Leonard,"Great, what do you want to do?"
Leonard,I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
Leonard,What can we do that’s different?
Leonard,"You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?"
Leonard,Aw. What’s wrong with her?
Leonard,That’s not what I meant.
Leonard,What ails her?
Leonard,"Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?"
Leonard,I also love you.
Leonard,He’d probably give you homework.
Leonard,Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.
Leonard,You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
Leonard,Yeah. We should do it more often.
Leonard," Ah, it’s Penny."
Leonard,"Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
Leonard,"Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do."
Leonard,"Yeah, she does."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish."
Leonard,"Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too."
Leonard,Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.
Leonard,"Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth."
Leonard,May the force be with you. Get it?
Leonard,"Hey, you got a second?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news."
Leonard,I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
Leonard,"Sorry, buddy."
Leonard,Comforting you?
Leonard,"Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday."
Leonard,"Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you."
Leonard,Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
Leonard,"He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?"
Leonard,Hmm?
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight."
Leonard,I know.
Leonard,"Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead."
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,I am not a crybaby.
Leonard,"The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift."
Leonard,I got your back.
Leonard,"So, what did you think of your first funeral?"
Leonard,"Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house."
Leonard,"Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets."
Leonard,"Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language."
Leonard,That’s true.
Leonard,I just thought of one more.
Leonard,I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.
Leonard,"I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one."
Leonard,I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.
Leonard,"Yeah, I think I would."
Leonard,Hmm.
Leonard,It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.
Leonard,"On the one hand, if I say yes…"
Leonard,"Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?"
Leonard,"Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter."
Leonard,"Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you."
Leonard,"Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…"
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?"
Leonard,"It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night."
Leonard,At least they toned him down in the second one.
Leonard,Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
Leonard,"Hey, how were things on the set?"
Leonard,I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
Leonard,"It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her."
Leonard,I’m her boyfriend.
Leonard,"A little, yeah."
Leonard,You having second thoughts about acting?
Leonard,"Yeah, but it’s not always that bad."
Leonard,"What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?"
Leonard,"Yeah, but there was ample parking."
Leonard,And you were so good in the TV commercial.
Leonard,And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
Leonard,Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
Leonard,Can I get you anything?
Leonard,With your career?
Leonard,Like what?
Leonard,"Come on, be serious."
Leonard,"Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?"
Leonard,So I’m like a bran muffin.
Leonard,"No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you."
Leonard,"Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes."
Leonard,"No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon."
Leonard,"You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself."
Leonard,Then what do you need?
Leonard,Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
Leonard,"Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!"
Leonard,"So is that it? Are, are we engaged?"
Leonard,All right.
Leonard,I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
Leonard,"Oh, I know. This might help."
Leonard,"I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?"
Leonard,This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
Leonard,How’s your mom holding up?
Leonard,"Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged."
Leonard,"Hey, hey, what the hell?"
Leonard,"Hey, buddy."
Leonard,You okay?
Leonard,"That’s a rude thing to say, out loud."
Leonard,"Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions."
Leonard,"Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news."
Leonard,"Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
Leonard,I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
Leonard,You know what? It’s probably fine.
Leonard,I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
Leonard,"Thanks, Mom."
Leonard,"Yes, it would."
Leonard,What you working on?
Leonard,Oh. How’s it going?
Leonard,It’s nice that you called them esteemed.
Leonard,"So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you."
Leonard,"Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements."
Leonard,I’m not.
Leonard,"Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live."
Leonard,"Well, well, we might want to live together."
Leonard,That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
Leonard,"Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary."
Leonard,"I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall."
Leonard,"No, I did not."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves."
Leonard,"Well, yeah."
Leonard,"Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh."
Leonard,It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
Leonard,"I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?"
Leonard,Okay. And when would that be?
Leonard,"No, I thought he was with you."
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,"Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
Leonard,"Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really."
Leonard,I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?
Leonard,I’m gonna see where he is.
Leonard,"Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone."
Leonard,"Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried."
Leonard,That’s weird.
Leonard,He’s at the train station.
Leonard,"It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him."
Leonard,It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
Leonard,"Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home."
Leonard,So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
Leonard,"Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland."
Leonard,Then what can I do?
Leonard,"Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting."
Leonard,What? Why?
Leonard,You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
Leonard,"No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies."
Leonard,"I know, but…"
Leonard,"Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way."
Leonard,Okay. Good luck.
Leonard,"Bye, buddy. Sheldon?"
Leonard,I’m gonna miss you.
Leonard,He just made that easier.
Leonard,He’s okay?
Leonard,"Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…"
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,"Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that.  Hello?"
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice."
Leonard,I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.
Leonard,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?"
Leonard,He got all of his stuff stolen.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?"
Leonard,I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Leonard,"Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled."
Leonard,Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
Leonard,"Oh, right."
Leonard,"All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?"
Leonard,"Come on, you didn’t even try."
Leonard,Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
Leonard,"Yeah, time’s gonna fly by."
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,"So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?"
Leonard,How were they?
Leonard,Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
Leonard,"I’m sorry, so you never went outside?"
Leonard,I don’t care.
Leonard,What’s the big deal?
Leonard,"Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me."
Leonard,Just tell her.
Leonard,"Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?"
Leonard,Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
Leonard,Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.
Leonard,And you thought they all had a silver lining.
Leonard,"Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
Leonard,"Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?"
Leonard,"Hey, how’d it go with human resources?"
Leonard,The kids are gonna love him.
Leonard,"This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong."
Leonard,"Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
Leonard,Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
Leonard,"Well, that’s not your fault."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Yeah, why would you do that?"
Leonard,Hmm. You’re up late.
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you doing this?"
Leonard,"No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?"
Leonard,"You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it."
Leonard,Might be something to think about.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD."
Leonard,"Come on, give him a hard one."
Leonard,"Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea"
Leonard,Yes.  
Leonard,We are so smart.
Leonard,Right again. 
Leonard,"Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate."
Leonard,Baseball.
Leonard,He’s practicing.
Leonard,"C’mon now, throw one."
Leonard,Now you know why we’re not outside.
Leonard,"Oh, that poor waiter."
Leonard,You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.
Leonard,Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
Leonard,"You don’t honestly think that, do you?"
Leonard,"There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it."
Leonard,That’s the part you have a problem with?
Leonard,"Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?"
Leonard,So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
Leonard,"Yeah, toddlers do that."
Leonard,You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
Leonard,Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
Leonard,Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.
Leonard,I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
Leonard,How ridiculous is he?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion."
Leonard,"So, this is accurate?"
Leonard,Fine. We’ll take it right now.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,Come on. It’ll be fun.
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,Are you mad at me?
Leonard,"Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?"
Leonard,What are you worried about?
Leonard,"Yeah, that scares me, too."
Leonard,Sometimes.
Leonard,"Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing."
Leonard,I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
Leonard,I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
Leonard,"No, no, no, I don’t want to."
Leonard,Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
Leonard,"Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
Leonard,"This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game."
Leonard,"On our Quidditch team, he…"
Leonard,Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
Leonard,Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
Leonard,"Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us."
Leonard,I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.
Leonard,What happens if she doesn’t like us?
Leonard,"Nice to finally meet you, too."
Leonard,"Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her."
Leonard,"Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs."
Leonard,"Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
Leonard,"Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?"
Leonard,It’s kind of a dream come true.
Leonard,It’s not that bad.
Leonard,"Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store."
Leonard,"Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?"
Leonard,And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
Leonard,Why say it?
Leonard,"Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?"
Leonard,"Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?"
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,Will you stay out of this?
Leonard,That’s true.
Leonard,Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.
Leonard,There’s something I wanted to run past you.
Leonard,"Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?"
Leonard,"Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,I know. I was looking forward to it.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
Leonard,That’s not what happened.
Leonard,Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.
Leonard,I think someone owes me an apology.
Leonard,"Well, maybe we have lost our focus."
Leonard,Then we’ll go to a hotel.
Leonard,Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.
Leonard,You would go to a beach house?
Leonard,"Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday."
Leonard,They seem okay with it.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world."
Leonard,"Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV."
Leonard,"I, I think I still have it."
Leonard,"Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend."
Leonard,Robot prostitute.
Leonard,"Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion."
Leonard,"You know, let’s just come up with something new."
Leonard,How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
Leonard,"Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,Had will have placed?
Leonard,"Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline."
Leonard,Wait. Is brought right?
Leonard,I don’t know. You did it to me.
Leonard,Guys.
Leonard,"Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus."
Leonard,All right.
Leonard,"So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology."
Leonard,I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?
Leonard,Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
Leonard,If only we had one.
Leonard,"Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off."
Leonard,"All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…"
Leonard,"I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…"
Leonard,"We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?"
Leonard,Thank you. And now I owe you one.
Leonard,Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark."
Leonard,It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
Leonard,"So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?"
Leonard,It really does hold up.
Leonard,She doesn’t flirt with doctors.
Leonard,"Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
Leonard,"I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba."
Leonard,"Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost."
Leonard,"So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga."
Leonard,"Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…"
Leonard,Hmm.
Leonard,Huh. What is this?
Leonard,The one I gave you?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Leonard,Nothing.
Leonard,You’re right.
Leonard,Doesn’t sound that bad.
Leonard,"Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet."
Leonard,"You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it."
Leonard,"The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out."
Leonard,"Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
Leonard,"I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this."
Leonard,"I don’t, either."
Leonard,"Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
Leonard,"Hey, you got a sec?"
Leonard,I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night."
Leonard,"Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution."
Leonard,"Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever."
Leonard,"Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby."
Leonard,"I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
Leonard,Maybe.
Leonard,"Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?"
Leonard,Thanks again for having us.
Leonard,"Well, nailed it."
Leonard,Like I would swing with him.
Leonard,She made him a chore chart.
Leonard,"I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
Leonard,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like."
Leonard,Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
Leonard,Should we go?
Leonard,"I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too."
Leonard,"Great timing, food just got here."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"No, but you can have mine."
Leonard,What? Why didn’t you say that first?
Leonard,Can I help you?
Leonard,May I ask why?
Leonard,"Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you."
Leonard,"I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée."
Leonard,I think so.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,Thank you. Sorry.
Leonard,He tried to score with Penny.
Leonard,That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really."
Leonard,I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.
Leonard,Can we please change the subject?
Leonard,"Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
Leonard,Can we talk in private?
Leonard,I’ll be right back.
Leonard,"So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?"
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,"Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage."
Leonard,"No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too."
Leonard,"A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy."
Leonard,Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
Leonard,"All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure. You owe me."
Leonard,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid."
Leonard,"No, because I liked it."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Next game, let’s switch helmets."
Leonard,I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.
Leonard,"Uh, guys, we’re locked in here."
Leonard,Oh-hom yeah.
Leonard,Next level.
Leonard,Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
Leonard,Got it.
Leonard,Just hang on.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night."
Leonard,"I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart."
Leonard,Don’t rule out the dating.
Leonard,But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
Leonard,"Hey, where’s Bernadette?"
Leonard,"Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?"
Leonard,"Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons."
Leonard,Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
Leonard,"There, perfect."
Leonard,I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
Leonard,Was that a flask?
Leonard,You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
Leonard,"If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?"
Leonard,"And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to."
Leonard,"You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."
Leonard,"Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones."
Leonard,"Wow, you look amazing."
Leonard,"Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing."
Leonard,"He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin."
Leonard,"Oh, the girls really did a nice job."
Leonard,What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.
Leonard,I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
Leonard,"Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…"
Leonard,"No, you wouldn’t have."
Leonard,It was before my growth spurt.
Leonard,Very funny.
Leonard,I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
Leonard,There’s no music.
Leonard,"My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats."
Leonard,Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
Leonard,I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
Leonard,"Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses."
Leonard,Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.
Leonard,"Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I think you could give a better clue.
Leonard,"Okay, why?"
Leonard,"If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
Leonard,What’s your problem?
Leonard,"It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest."
Leonard,"I told you, there’s nothing to worry about."
Leonard,"Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?"
Leonard,Hey. What’re you working on?
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
Leonard,I’m not allergic to latex.
Leonard,For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
Leonard,"I don’t have epilepsy, either."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
Leonard,"Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die."
Leonard,"Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike."
Leonard,"If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?"
Leonard,"Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it."
Leonard,The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
Leonard,"He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it."
Leonard,How is it my fault?
Leonard,"Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
Leonard,"I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider."
Leonard,You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
Leonard,"Oh, what’d you get?"
Leonard,"That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers."
Leonard,I don’t think he had a family.
Leonard,"I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box."
Leonard,"Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important."
Leonard,It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
Leonard,"That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it."
Leonard,Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
Leonard,"Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?"
Leonard,This has to mean something.
Leonard,"Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer."
Leonard,"Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."
Leonard,"Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
Leonard,"I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman. "
Leonard,"Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?"
Leonard,Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
Leonard,Any chance you know what it is?
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?"
Leonard,"Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott."
Leonard,I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
Leonard,That’s a nice way of looking at it.
Leonard,"You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott."
Leonard,"Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,How come you’re up so late?
Leonard,"Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking."
Leonard,Sad?
Leonard,Yeah. What did they say?
Leonard,Congratulations.
Leonard,"Sheldon, that wasn’t for you."
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,"You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen."
Leonard,Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
Leonard,"Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no."
Leonard,"You shut the loading doors, right?"
Leonard,Do you know what a disaster this is?
Leonard,What do we do? Should we call someone?
Leonard,"Okay, how do we catch it?"
Leonard,It’s not a moth.
Leonard,"Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?"
Leonard,A Slim Jim?
Leonard,Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
Leonard,I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
Leonard,"No, admit that you contaminated the clean room."
Leonard,"Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
Leonard,"What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
Leonard,"Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag."
Leonard,"I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it."
Leonard,Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
Leonard,And you found somebody you could push around?
Leonard,"No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
Leonard,"Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
Leonard,Do you want the fire extinguisher?
Leonard,Great. Here you go.
Leonard,"You miss the blanket now, don’t you?"
Leonard,"Relax, it wasn’t your fault."
Leonard,"Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds."
Leonard,"I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it."
Leonard,Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
Leonard,Anything?
Leonard,"Wait, wait, his wing moved."
Leonard,"No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one."
Leonard,I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
Leonard,"No, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
Leonard,I can’t do that.
Leonard,She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,I thought you hate giving gifts.
Leonard,"Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it."
Leonard,Blue and yellow make green.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it."
Leonard,"You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into."
Leonard,"You got it, you girls are in charge."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
Leonard,I did not force you to go to that.
Leonard,I wasn’t gonna get beat up.
Leonard,Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
Leonard,"Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy."
Leonard,That’s what I was doing.
Leonard,"Well, yeah."
Leonard,This isn’t so bad.
Leonard,"Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here."
Leonard,That’s true.
Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s fine."
Leonard,"Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win."
Leonard,"I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do."
Leonard,"Look at you, being all mature."
Leonard,"I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?"
Leonard,"On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?"
Leonard,That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
Leonard,What? Then. then why don’t you do it?
Leonard,Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
Leonard,"Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you."
Leonard,"Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away."
Leonard,You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
Leonard,Do you mean that?
Leonard,"Come on, don’t get upset."
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.
Leonard,Buddy.
Leonard,Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
Leonard,All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,You got it.
Leonard,"I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun."
Leonard,"Yeah, it looks great."
Leonard,"Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m proud of him, too."
Leonard,"Okay, we’re headed out, see you later."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years."
Leonard,Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
Leonard,"Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever."
Leonard,"I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours."
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,"Hey, we’re home. Any progress?"
Leonard,What are you doing? It’s time to go.
Leonard,"Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
Leonard,Call me if you need anything.
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,Cinnamon. Give me another one.
Leonard,"We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon."
Leonard,"Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home."
Leonard,"That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them."
Leonard,So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
Leonard,"Howard’s right, that’ll never work."
Leonard,"Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said."
Leonard,What is going on?
Leonard,"Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night."
Leonard,"That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull."
Leonard,He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
Leonard,You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
Leonard,Here we are.
Leonard,"You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute."
Leonard,Maybe in the morning.
Leonard,"You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face."
Leonard,"I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Wow, you remember that?"
Leonard,"You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table."
Leonard,"Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own."
Leonard,"Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…"
Leonard,"No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon."
Leonard,Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
Leonard,What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
Leonard,"I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
Leonard,"No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?"
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,You do? You’re not messing with me?
Leonard,You’re giving me a sticker?
Leonard,I’m not a preschooler.
Leonard,I earned this. Back off.
Leonard,You’re still awake?
Leonard,You worked out all the math.
Leonard,You wrote a paper on my idea?
Leonard,When did my idea become our idea?
Leonard,This is good. Our idea is really good.
Leonard,"You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal."
Leonard,"Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?"
Leonard,You’re sure it’s good?
Leonard,"Okay, partner, let’s do it."
Leonard,"One, two three."
Leonard,"Well, we did it."
Leonard,Is your tongue blue?
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Really? What’d they say?
Leonard,"Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative."
Leonard,"Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?"
Leonard,"Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."
Leonard,"It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity."
Leonard,"Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level."
Leonard,"Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this."
Leonard,"Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter."
Leonard,Do it.
Leonard,Somebody else do it.
Leonard,"Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level."
Leonard,Read it back one more time.
Leonard,And you don’t think that’s too rough?
Leonard,Do you really want him to write back?
Leonard,Me-wow.
Leonard,What did you write?
Leonard,What does that mean?
Leonard,Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.
Leonard,"Oh, really?"
Leonard,Never noticed that about you.
Leonard,"All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished."
Leonard,You really didn’t like our paper?
Leonard,Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
Leonard,"And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing."
Leonard,You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
Leonard,"Are you kidding? No, no."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, I’m good."
Leonard,No problem.
Leonard,The place really looks great.
Leonard,"We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."
Leonard,Why don’t we go get the food for the party.
Leonard,"Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation."
Leonard,"Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center."
Leonard,"Oh yeah, look at that."
Leonard,We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
Leonard,That would be great.
Leonard,"I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
Leonard,He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
Leonard,Come on. Sorry to bother you.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Sorry again.
Leonard,That would be great.
Leonard,"Yeah, thank you."
Leonard,"That’s it, that’s the line."
Leonard,What do you think?
Leonard,I can’t believe they did that.
Leonard,"Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too."
Leonard,And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
Leonard,So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
Leonard,"Hey, you okay?"
Leonard,What’s wrong?
Leonard,I’m so sorry.
Leonard,"Not right now, Sheldon."
Leonard,Buddy.
Leonard,"How are you doing, Stuart?"
Leonard,"If you want, I can yell at you later."
Leonard,Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.
Leonard,That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
Leonard,"I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?"
Leonard,"I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it."
Leonard,In love yet?
Leonard,"Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure, that might be fun."
Leonard,Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
Leonard,I’m in love. Let’s do something else.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
Leonard,What’s that?
Leonard,Ladies?
Leonard,Yup.
Leonard,This is cool.
Leonard,I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
Leonard,Yup. Got the code.
Leonard,Which book are we looking for?
Leonard,Here it is. There’s a black light.
Leonard,I bet the key’s behind it.
Leonard,We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
Leonard,"I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone."
Leonard,"Admit it, you’re a little turned on."
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,"Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you."
Leonard,Why a turtle?
Leonard,"Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?"
Leonard,"Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make."
Leonard,"No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you."
Leonard,"Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store."
Leonard,In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,"Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic."
Leonard,"No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."
Leonard,You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego."
Leonard,"I thought it’d be a little more, just more."
Leonard,"Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
Leonard,"Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?"
Leonard,"Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do."
Leonard,"Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this."
Leonard,"Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it."
Leonard,Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
Leonard,"Well, we did it."
Leonard,"I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete."
Leonard,"So, where do we want to hang it?"
Leonard,But it’s an expression of our love.
Leonard,Seems a shame to throw it away.
Leonard,"God, I love you. I love you so much."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Actually, your name is on the electric bill."
Leonard,I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,Did they hate it?
Leonard,So what’s the problem?
Leonard,Sheldon.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Uh, that, that’s not necessary."
Leonard,Cooper and his team?
Leonard,"Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important."
Leonard,That’s not helping.
Leonard,It’s kind of a big deal.
Leonard,Can we please just stop talking about it?
Leonard,"Nothing, I’m fine."
Leonard,What are we doing?
Leonard,Oh.
Leonard,"Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing."
Leonard,Does it have a camera in it?
Leonard,Baby’s listening.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
Leonard,Thank you. What did he say?
Leonard,Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
Leonard,"If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I’m the one who thought of it.
Leonard,Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
Leonard,He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
Leonard,"I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter."
Leonard,Of course.
Leonard,"So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?"
Leonard,Subtle.
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,"Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?"
Leonard,"No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?"
Leonard,"Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering."
Leonard,You’re being ridiculous.
Leonard,"Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me."
Leonard,So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
Leonard,You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
Leonard,"Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up."
Leonard,"Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway."
Leonard,Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
Leonard,Keep going.
Leonard,"If it’s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I’m in."
Leonard,That soy Frappuccino I had.
Leonard,"I don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?"
Leonard,We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
Leonard,"No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool."
Leonard,What? This road trip just got crazy.
Leonard,I’m surprised you know that reference.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,It could be.
Leonard,Exactly.
Leonard,Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
Leonard,I doubt it.
Leonard,"If we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
Leonard,"Oh, that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there."
Leonard,I don’t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
Leonard,"We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
Leonard,"I’m about to lose control, and I think I like it."
Leonard,Wasn’t even that hard to find.
Leonard,I know. You want to get a picture?
Leonard,"Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us."
Leonard,"No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me."
Leonard,"Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous."
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in."
Leonard,And that’s how it’s done.
Leonard,"We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda."
Leonard,"Uh, I’m just gonna be honest with the guy."
Leonard,"Well, what’s your plan?"
Leonard,"Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth."
Leonard,"We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill."
Leonard,Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?
Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
Leonard,"Oh, shut up."
Leonard,"Uh-huh, I’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
Leonard,We understand. Thank you so much.
Leonard,"Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee."
Leonard,"The glass is empty, Sheldon. It’s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?"
Leonard,"Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it."
Leonard,That part was pretty good.
Leonard,You did flop around a lot.
Leonard,"You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I’m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant."
Leonard,I know.
Leonard,I guess this could count as an adventure.
Leonard,"Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif."
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist."
Leonard,"Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this."
Leonard,"I was gonna say or, but why bother?"
Leonard,"Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,This is exciting.
Leonard,Psst.
Leonard,"I, I didn’t want to interrupt."
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Hey, great."
Leonard,"Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj."
Leonard,It really is.
Leonard,You have a new job.
Leonard,I don’t think you can do both.
Leonard,"Stay out of it, Kevin Smith."
Leonard,"No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation."
Leonard,Give me back that juice.
Leonard,"Well, what if you get it?"
Leonard,From a Kevin Smith movie?
Leonard,I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
Leonard,I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
Leonard,"Wait, twice?"
Leonard,"Like, times two twice?"
Leonard,I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
Leonard,"Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?"
Leonard,"Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?"
Leonard,"What does that mean, under your bed?"
Leonard,"Wait a minute, you have a guy?"
Leonard,Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
Leonard,"Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off."
Leonard,"Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature."
Leonard,"That would be great, thank you."
Leonard,"Yes, it is, Wil."
Leonard,Hello? What is this?
Leonard,Are those my sheets?
Leonard,"Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m good."
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it."
Leonard,"That’s pretty cool, Sheldon."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."
Leonard,Congratulations.
Leonard,Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
Leonard,My mommy raised a gentleman.
Leonard,Yeah. I’m excited to help.
Leonard,"I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict."
Leonard,"Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda."
Leonard,"Mmm, they’re alpha males."
Leonard,We could be betas. They’re second in charge.
Leonard,Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
Leonard,"Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?"
Leonard,I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
Leonard,Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
Leonard,"Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player."
Leonard,That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
Leonard,"My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him."
Leonard,They zip him up in that bag.
Leonard,The flower dies.
Leonard,"All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple."
Leonard,"It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
Leonard,That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
Leonard,Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
Leonard,The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
Leonard,All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
Leonard,I know.
Leonard,"Yeah, you know what else it is?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,We want you back on the project with us.
Leonard,"Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it."
Leonard,How is that building on what he just said?
Leonard,"Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant."
Leonard,It’s not Simon Says.
Leonard,"Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be."
Leonard,Squeeze yourself.
Leonard,"What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt."
Leonard,You let a guy sit on me.
Leonard,"I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside."
Leonard,Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge."
Leonard,"Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?"
Leonard,Nope. It’s pretty exciting.
Leonard,How would I be blinded?
Leonard,I’ll take my chances.
Leonard,"Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me."
Leonard,How’d you get ready so fast?
Leonard,Why did you need a belt?
Leonard,It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
Leonard,"No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around."
Leonard,"Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled."
Leonard,"Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast."
Leonard,I don’t think so.
Leonard,I guess not.
Leonard,"Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too."
Leonard,"Oh, thank you, but I’m okay."
Leonard,"Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders."
Leonard,"Hey, where’d you go?"
Leonard,"Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?"
Leonard,A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
Leonard,"Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse."
Leonard,I don’t think this is gonna work.
Leonard,"A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing."
Leonard,Oh. Done and done.
Leonard,They’re graduating.
Leonard,"My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations."
Leonard,So you really think they liked it?
Leonard,"I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning."
Leonard,"No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force."
Leonard,"If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you."
Leonard,"Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different."
Leonard,"No, we’re kind of taking it slow."
Leonard,What does that mean?
Leonard,"Yes, Mother."
Leonard,"I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other."
Leonard,"See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?"
Leonard,"Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,East Texas.
Leonard,"Hey, look who’s here."
Leonard,We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
Leonard,"That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem."
Leonard,"Subtle, mom, real subtle."
Leonard,"You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself."
Leonard,"You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner."
Leonard,"So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged."
Leonard,We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
Leonard,It came from Tiffany’s.
Leonard,Keep walking.
Leonard,"Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers."
Leonard,"Yes, you are a super weaner."
Leonard,"Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler."
Leonard,"Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me."
Leonard,"Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,That’s not what it is.
Leonard,"Oh, me."
Leonard,I don’t really feel I deserve it.
Leonard,"Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else."
Leonard,"Oh, really? That’s too bad."
Leonard,Wow. When does that start?
Leonard,"Oh, my mother."
Leonard,That was really intense.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
Leonard,I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
Leonard,I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
Leonard,Mmm. My pleasure.
Leonard,Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
Leonard,We’re gonna set a date.
Leonard,Really good.
Leonard,And we’ve been busy with our paper.
Leonard,"Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date."
Leonard,"So, why haven’t we picked a date?"
Leonard,"Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?"
Leonard,"You still want to get married, right?"
Leonard,I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?
Leonard,"It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?"
Leonard,Is your dad paying for it?
Leonard,"Okay, two friends each."
Leonard,Fine. I want black-tie.
Leonard,"Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies."
Leonard,Great.
Leonard,Shut up.
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not a whiner."
Leonard,"Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
Leonard,"Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together."
Leonard,Are you saying you want to get married?
Leonard,I’m in. Let’s do it.
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,Doesn’t sound very romantic.
Leonard,I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
Leonard,I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
Leonard,It is. It is about us.
Leonard,Right. No surprises.
Leonard,"Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you."
Leonard,"You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us."
Leonard,"Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
Leonard,"Okay, um, well, there was this girl."
Leonard,Nothing really. It was just kissing.
Leonard,"And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know."
Leonard,Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s too bad."
Leonard,Hmm?
Leonard,"Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets."
Leonard,Would you rather I didn’t tell you?
Leonard,"See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?"
Leonard,"I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it."
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,Right.
Leonard,"It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick."
Leonard,"So, we’re still getting married?"
Leonard,Because we love each other.
Leonard,And it’s the happiest day of our lives.
Leonard,"Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet."
Leonard,"‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope."
Leonard,"If you’re not into this, we can do it another time."
Leonard,"Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey."
Leonard,No. Why?
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,What happened now?
Leonard,"Oh, no. Seriously?"
Leonard,Amy broke up with Sheldon.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad."
Leonard,Penny’s on the phone with her.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"No, I think it’s because we’re eloping."
Leonard,They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
Leonard,"Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door."
Leonard,"I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it."
Leonard,You sure?
Leonard,And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
Leonard,You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
Leonard,"Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster."
Leonard,"Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
Leonard,You know what? It’s fine.
Leonard,"Yup, just want to get married."
Leonard,This is it.
Leonard,I love you.
Leonard,We’re good.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.
Leonard,"Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."
Leonard,I do.
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch."
Leonard,"No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold."
Leonard,Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
Leonard,I’m okay.
Leonard,"Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me."
Leonard,Everything all right?
Leonard,Just tell me.
Leonard,"Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so."
Leonard,"Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth."
Leonard,"No, she had dental insurance."
Leonard,Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
Leonard,"What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie."
Leonard,"Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work."
Leonard,"I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking"
Leonard,"No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it."
Leonard,I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
Leonard,"Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
Leonard,I’m not glowing. I’m upset.
Leonard,"Sure, let’s make it an even hundred."
Leonard,I wouldn’t.
Leonard,"Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one."
Leonard,I figured that out.
Leonard,Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.
Leonard,"How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Of course not.
Leonard,What are we gonna do?
Leonard,"Please, tell me how I can fix it."
Leonard,"Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard."
Leonard,"You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?"
Leonard,What is happening?
Leonard,"Well, trust me, I wish it never happened."
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"
Leonard,"Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out."
Leonard,Call you back. Hey.
Leonard,I would love that.
Leonard,"If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling."
Leonard,"Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?"
Leonard,"Wake up, wake up, wake up."
Leonard,What? Why?
Leonard,"Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry."
Leonard,"Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy."
Leonard,"What, you actually want to meet her?"
Leonard,I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
Leonard,"Fine, you want to meet her?"
Leonard,How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
Leonard,You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
Leonard,"Oh, great, there’s Mandy."
Leonard,That’s not helpful.
Leonard,Are we done?
Leonard,"I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Uh, do you mind if I sit?"
Leonard,"So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."
Leonard,"You know, what we did, when we were drunk."
Leonard,"No, we just made out."
Leonard,"Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently."
Leonard,"Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work."
Leonard,Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
Leonard,What else would it be?
Leonard,"No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that."
Leonard,"You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her."
Leonard,"I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."
Leonard,"Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me."
Leonard,"I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it."
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
Leonard,"I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why."
Leonard,"Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you."
Leonard,You do?
Leonard,I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
Leonard,"Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?"
Leonard,"Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time."
Leonard,"Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."
Leonard,"Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?"
Leonard,"Yes, please."
Leonard,What is this?
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,"Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,When do we leave?
Leonard,This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.
Leonard,"So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?"
Leonard,India.
Leonard,Your house?
Leonard,"Fun, I’ve never been there."
Leonard,"If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?"
Leonard,"Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists."
Leonard,"Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,And there’s your damsel.
Leonard,"Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
Leonard,"Let’s see, a lever, a lever."
Leonard,We’re gonna be here foreever.
Leonard,I don’t think the lever’s working.
Leonard,There’s gotta be something else we could try.
Leonard,"Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?"
Leonard,They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.
Leonard,It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.
Leonard,"Well, let’s start small. We can always add more."
Leonard,We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
Leonard,I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man.
Leonard,"It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space."
Leonard,"Come on, buddy."
Leonard,Do I really have to do that now?
Leonard,It’s harder than I thought.
Leonard,That helped.
Leonard,"Well, it’s Thai food night."
Leonard,You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?
Leonard,"Oh, thank God."
Leonard,"You heard him, no."
Leonard,"I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon."
Leonard,I hope so.
Leonard,"No, of course not. I just feel bad."
Leonard,I did like that he had the weather on it.
Leonard,"I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe."
Leonard,"Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?"
Leonard,"I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening."
Leonard,Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall.
Leonard,"Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it’s not."
Leonard,"Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
Leonard,Fine.
Leonard,"Hey, ready for lunch?"
Leonard,That’ll teach her to care about your health.
Leonard,It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
Leonard,"Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football."
Leonard,What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
Leonard,"I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club."
Leonard,"It’s indoors, so no sunscreen."
Leonard,No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
Leonard,Preach.
Leonard,What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
Leonard,I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
Leonard,That’s not why we’re here.
Leonard,This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,When was your honour insulted?
Leonard,"Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate."
Leonard,"Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy."
Leonard,"Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her."
Leonard,"Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you."
Leonard,"Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point."
Leonard,Of course. She deserves to be happy.
Leonard,"Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea."
Leonard,And now the crazy version of what I just said.
Leonard,"Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought."
Leonard,"I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon."
Leonard,"If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory."
Leonard,Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
Leonard,Three.
Leonard,You’re just sweaty from exercise.
Leonard,I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
Leonard,We should let you guys talk.
Leonard,Look at me go.
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,Just tell me.
Leonard,"Oh, well, that kind of stinks."
Leonard,What are we going to do?
Leonard,"I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month."
Leonard,That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
Leonard,Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
Leonard,"Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
Leonard,"Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?"
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,We’d have to go to every Party City in California.
Leonard,Who is he?
Leonard,How does he get the helium?
Leonard,"Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
Leonard,He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
Leonard,The man restocking the cereal shelves.
Leonard,He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
Leonard,Do you want liquid helium or not?
Leonard,Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.
Leonard,"We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys."
Leonard,"Sure. So, are we doing this?"
Leonard,Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?
Leonard,"A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
Leonard,Done.
Leonard,"Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better."
Leonard,That must be him.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…"
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, right here."
Leonard,"What ya doing, Skippy?"
Leonard,"Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists."
Leonard,My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
Leonard,I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
Leonard,"Afraid so, Skippy."
Leonard,"All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody."
Leonard,"No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year."
Leonard,"Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium."
Leonard,Here’s the money. Can we do this?
Leonard,It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.
Leonard,Will you stop with that already?
Leonard,And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
Leonard,Let’s just start the experiment.
Leonard,We’re not getting caught.
Leonard,"The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,It’s probably USC or UCLA.
Leonard,Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
Leonard,"Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules."
Leonard,Ma’am.
Leonard,Thank you for coming back.
Leonard,"No, nothing. We just changed our mind."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
Leonard,He wants more money.
Leonard,Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
Leonard,"Thank you, Barry."
Leonard,Can you give us a minute?
Leonard,"Me neither, but what other choice do we have?"
Leonard,I promise this is the last time.
Leonard,It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
Leonard,Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
Leonard,"You tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
Leonard,Why is he writing to you?
Leonard,I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.
Leonard,How long have you known Adam?
Leonard,And what are you getting him back for?
Leonard,"My brother was mean to me, too."
Leonard,When did we get a wall safe?
Leonard,When did we get a floor safe?
Leonard,There’s a security camera?
Leonard,You have a will?
Leonard,Will Wil want it?
Leonard,You bought her a ring?
Leonard,"Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you."
Leonard,You did go pfft.
Leonard,Just like you.
Leonard,I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Nirsh.
Leonard,He didn’t meant that.
Leonard,"Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home."
Leonard,"Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal."
Leonard,You’re in a good mood.
Leonard,What brought this on?
Leonard,"Hey, I made French toast sticks."
Leonard,"Ah, I also made oatmeal."
Leonard,I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
Leonard,What? I don’t want to do that.
Leonard,This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
Leonard,So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
Leonard,Not really.
Leonard,You just happen to have those in the car?
Leonard,By stalking them?
Leonard,Can I see?
Leonard,"I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying."
Leonard,"Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?"
Leonard,Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
Leonard,What happened?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind."
Leonard,You really should.
Leonard,"Well, we’re having everyone over."
Leonard,Otherwise we’d love to.
Leonard,"Yeah, poor us."
Leonard,I know. I feel so grown up.
Leonard,"Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?"
Leonard,My birthday.
Leonard,"It’s just the four digits, month and day."
Leonard,"Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?"
Leonard,"You don’t know my birthday, do you?"
Leonard,"Well, what is it?"
Leonard,May what?
Leonard,You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
Leonard,"Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
Leonard,"Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog."
Leonard,Baby.
Leonard,Justin.
Leonard,Nice try. NSYNC forever.
Leonard,"Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…"
Leonard,Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
Leonard,Sure you did.
Leonard,What? I didn’t know you had a journal.
Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
Leonard,"Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident."
Leonard,I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
Leonard,"You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm."
Leonard,"Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote."
Leonard,"Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny."
Leonard,"Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”"
Leonard,Why would I lie?
Leonard,"Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah."
Leonard,"Be right there. Hi, lover."
Leonard,I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
Leonard,"Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?"
Leonard,"Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?"
Leonard,I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.
Leonard,Since when do you hum songs?
Leonard,You were just humming.
Leonard,How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
Leonard,"Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?"
Leonard,Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
Leonard,It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.
Leonard,Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
Leonard,"Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service."
Leonard,"Eh, that just means going barefoot."
Leonard,Put on some headphones.
Leonard,How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
Leonard,Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
Leonard,"What do you want, a medal? It was your gum."
Leonard,I love you.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, he got a tuba."
Leonard,"Hey, can we please get back to work?"
Leonard,"All right, just stop. This is ridiculous."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"That’s a trick question, right?"
Leonard,"Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you."
Leonard,There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
Leonard,I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.
Leonard,"Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?"
Leonard,Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,"Guys, tickets already went on sale."
Leonard,"I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale."
Leonard,"No, it’s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier."
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
Leonard,"I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days."
Leonard,I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
Leonard,I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
Leonard,Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?
Leonard,"You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us."
Leonard,What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?
Leonard,"He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?"
Leonard,Well…
Leonard,"Yeah, the wait is finally over."
Leonard,We will.
Leonard,We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
Leonard,"Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check."
Leonard,Check.
Leonard,"Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?"
Leonard,"So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?"
Leonard,"Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again."
Leonard,I’m really nervous.
Leonard,That’s true.
Leonard,"Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,How was your day?
Leonard,"Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?"
Leonard,I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
Leonard,None of that is true.
Leonard,That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
Leonard,What if I get caught?
Leonard,"Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you."
Leonard,Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Leonard,"Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?"
Leonard,"Well, then you know her better than I do."
Leonard,"Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?"
Leonard,"No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky."
Leonard,"Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now."
Leonard,"Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?"
Leonard,"Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it."
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…"
Leonard,"Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct."
Leonard,"All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you."
Leonard,So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
Leonard,"Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself."
Leonard,"Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter."
Leonard,"Well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
Leonard,You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
Leonard,"Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers."
Leonard,What is happening?
Leonard,And it’s gone.
Leonard,Good for you.
Leonard,Let me refresh your memory.
Leonard,"All right, here you go."
Leonard,You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.
Leonard,"No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break."
Leonard,I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
Leonard,"Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go."
Leonard,That sounds really fun.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas."
Leonard,"Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay."
Leonard,This weekend.
Leonard,"Well, Vegas, but…"
Leonard,"That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited."
Leonard,Not this time.
Leonard,"He’s coming, too."
Leonard,Nope.
Leonard,"Oh, great. Do that."
Leonard,"Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance."
Leonard,Thank you. I appreciate that.
Leonard,"Appreciate that, too."
Leonard,You’re still not coming.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come."
Leonard,"Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come."
Leonard,"Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour."
Leonard,You think they’ll still go on the trip?
Leonard,They’re not going on the trip.
Leonard,That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…"
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"What do we do, kick them off?"
Leonard,"Come on, you pain in the ass."
Leonard,"If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb."
Leonard,That someone has a name.
Leonard,Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
Leonard,"Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her."
Leonard,Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
Leonard,"Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology."
Leonard,Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
Leonard,Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
Leonard,"Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw."
Leonard,Can you please live with us forever?
Leonard,That’s my best friend.
Leonard,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Leonard,Did it?
Leonard,Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
Leonard,Just get in here.
Leonard,"He never disappoints, does he?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no."
Leonard,You don’t sound very excited about it.
Leonard,"Yeah, just get it over with."
Leonard,Not really.
Leonard,I stopped counting at four.
Leonard,She meant Emily.
Leonard,"Well, you were right, tears."
Leonard,"Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour."
Leonard,I know.
Leonard,"Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass."
Leonard,Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
Leonard,A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
Leonard,"I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?"
Leonard,Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
Leonard,"Oh, I took care of it."
Leonard,What are you gonna say?
Leonard,I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
Leonard,See if you can get a table by the window.
Leonard,What? Why?
Leonard,"It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?"
Leonard,"Well, glad you’re feeling better."
Leonard,Is that a big deal?
Leonard,"Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…"
Leonard,"Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot."
Leonard,"No, they’re not."
Leonard,"Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight."
Leonard,"Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had."
Leonard,I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
Leonard,"Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing."
Leonard,Are you actually gonna dance?
Leonard,Of course.
Leonard,"No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business."
Leonard,That sounds fun. When’s it start?
Leonard,Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
Leonard,"Oh, thank God."
Leonard,We are young and fun.
Leonard,It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
Leonard,"Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Ready to play when you are.
Leonard,What’s going on?
Leonard,What? Congratulations.
Leonard,"Why oh, no?"
Leonard,"Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group."
Leonard,You’re the other baby.
Leonard,Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
Leonard,"Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting."
Leonard,It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.
Leonard,"Hey, you know what we should do?"
Leonard,Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
Leonard,And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Leonard,There’s no reason you can’t.
Leonard,That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.
Leonard,"Uh, these are strong, you should slow down."
Leonard,How is that a new invention?
Leonard,The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.
Leonard,Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
Leonard,Yeah. Why?
Leonard,Wow. I’ve never thought about that.
Leonard,You may have actually just come up with something.
Leonard,I really do.
Leonard,I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
Leonard,Can you focus on what we’re talking about?
Leonard,I’d enjoy that.
Leonard,"I’m telling you, you got this."
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Leonard,Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
Leonard,Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
Leonard,"Me, too. So, you ever think about it?"
Leonard,I think we’d make amazing parents.
Leonard,Way to narrow it down to everything.
Leonard,"Well, where’s that information been this whole time?"
Leonard,I’ll check his room.
Leonard,One day. Right.
Leonard,"And we live here, so we have no choice."
Leonard,"Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party."
Leonard,Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
Leonard,"Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?"
Leonard,Can I get his contact info?
Leonard,He is?
Leonard,"Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."
Leonard,Don’t say that to anyone.
Leonard,Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?
Leonard,"I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale."
Leonard,Sure.
Leonard,"So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday."
Leonard,Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
Leonard,Speech! Speech!
Leonard,Batman finally came to your party.
Leonard,"Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him."
Leonard,"No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time."
Leonard,"Again, no offence, but so have I."
Leonard,"Again, no…"
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
Leonard,"Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger."
Leonard,"Seriously, Barry, stop."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother."
Leonard,"Happy birthday, buddy."
Leonard,"Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together."
Leonard,"Ready when you are, Professor Hawking."
Leonard,"Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending."
Leonard,So what happens next?
Leonard,"Yeah, we did our own search."
Leonard,"If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy."
Leonard,"Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"
Leonard,"Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda."
Leonard,"Sorry, but we can’t sign this."
Leonard,Thank you for your time.
Leonard,"Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
Leonard,"Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all."
Leonard,"Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you."
Leonard,"Of course, we can split any profits three ways."
Leonard,"Sure, we could write something up."
Leonard,Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
Leonard,"I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
Leonard,"Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Good one.
Leonard,They’ve been out there a while.
Leonard,You guys all right?
Leonard,What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
Leonard,"Howard, what do you think?"
Leonard,"Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
Leonard,This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
Leonard,"If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set."
Leonard,Hey. What are you doing here?
Leonard,"Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make."
Leonard,Good. Slow.
Leonard,"You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could."
Leonard,I’ll show you how to do one.
Leonard,"After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."
Leonard,"Yeah, perfect."
Leonard,"And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard."
Leonard,We had a full spool yesterday.
Leonard,"Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store."
Leonard,"Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…"
Leonard,Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.
Leonard,Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
Leonard,I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
Leonard,"Oh. Sorry, we can’t."
Leonard,What about the girls?
Leonard,"Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original."
Leonard,What are we gonna tell the girls?
Leonard,I mean without lying.
Leonard,Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
Leonard,They bought it.
Leonard,"Oh, you’re good at this."
Leonard,"Hey, you were right."
Leonard,Who are you texting?
Leonard,He’ll never make it in time.
Leonard,"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Listen, we did a stupid thing."
Leonard,"So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner."
Leonard,Whatcha doing?
Leonard,Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
Leonard,"Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
Leonard,Because he’s hitting on you?
Leonard,"Oh, good."
Leonard,You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
Leonard,"Okay, one sec."
Leonard,I bought a baseball cap.
Leonard,"Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter."
Leonard,Anything you’d like to say to him?
Leonard,Why are you so mean to me?
Leonard,I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
Leonard,I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
Leonard,So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
Leonard,And there goes our hike.
Leonard,Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
Leonard,You’ll wish it would kill you.
Leonard,They have some board games.
Leonard,I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
Leonard,I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
Leonard,Right. So all we need is to…
Leonard,A scientist made that.
Leonard,"To be fair, good at both."
Leonard,I’ve never played that before.
Leonard,"Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested."
Leonard,"Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac."
Leonard,This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
Leonard,"Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink."
Leonard,Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Leonard,That’s right.
Leonard,"I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside."
Leonard,"What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
Leonard,"Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me."
Leonard,"A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies."
Leonard,Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
Leonard,"No, I do, and that’s why I hid it."
Leonard,"Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret."
Leonard,Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
Leonard,Really? Why?
Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me?
Leonard,That’s not true.
Leonard,"If that’s what you want to do, yes."
Leonard,"Oh, yes."
Leonard,"Well, that is the grown-up thing."
Leonard,I love you.
Leonard,"You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining."
Leonard,"No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat."
Leonard,But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
Leonard,"No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man."
Leonard,I thought you were back with Emily.
Leonard,You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
Leonard,Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
Leonard,"Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?"
Leonard,"People are coming over, it looked fun."
Leonard,Your attendance implies it’s not.
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months."
Leonard,"Oh, you know what? I’m not going."
Leonard,This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
Leonard,You’re the only one who eats them.
Leonard,"I’m not going, you can’t make me."
Leonard,You have fun. I will not be attending.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,You’re being ridiculous.
Leonard,Can you please talk to him?
Leonard,"Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party."
Leonard,Why are you taking his side?
Leonard,Leave me alone.
Leonard,Not funny.
Leonard,"Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here."
Leonard,"Yeah, that’s right."
Leonard,And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.
Leonard,I don’t want to.
Leonard,Stop saying meeting.
Leonard,You love The Simpsons.
Leonard,"Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character."
Leonard,"Howard, just come in here."
Leonard,"Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense."
Leonard,"If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize."
Leonard,Stuart.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
Leonard,"Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me."
Leonard,Sorry?
Leonard,"Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close."
Leonard,"Penny, but…"
Leonard,"I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out."
Leonard,Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
Leonard,"Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali."
Leonard,She defends him all the time.
Leonard,Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
Leonard,"You’re, you’re right, it feels good."
Leonard,"You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement."
Leonard,From Amy.
Leonard,"Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him."
Leonard,That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.
Leonard,I don’t think so. Why?
Leonard,It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
Leonard,That’s true.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Let’s get out of here.
Leonard,Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,What is it?
Leonard,That sounds fun.
Leonard,How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
Leonard,I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
Leonard,"The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out."
Leonard,Sure. I’d like to meet her.
Leonard,Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?
Leonard,"Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?"
Leonard,Who’s Frank and Alicia?
Leonard,"All right, here goes nothing."
Leonard,"Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing."
Leonard,"Good, it’s not just me."
Leonard,Hang on.
Leonard,"Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
Leonard,I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
Leonard,Since my preschool got a bunny.
Leonard,"Okay, have fun."
Leonard,We’re leaving now!
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?"
Leonard,I smell nothing.
Leonard,Just a whole lot of Afrin.
Leonard,"Yeah, mm-hmm."
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,But we won’t bore you with the details.
Leonard,What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
Leonard,And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
Leonard,Way better.
Leonard,"I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
Leonard,Why didn’t you say something?
Leonard,Would you like a glass of wine?
Leonard,Maybe we should take a step back.
Leonard,"No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system."
Leonard,What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
Leonard,How?
Leonard,Very funny.
Leonard,"Well, not really."
Leonard,Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.
Leonard,"I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault."
Leonard,Morning.
Leonard,Ugh. Too much wine.
Leonard,"Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"
Leonard,Does it bother you?
Leonard,Who are these people?
Leonard,What are you guys doing?
Leonard,"Oh, let me try."
Leonard,"Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop."
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?"
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?"
Leonard,"Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."
Leonard,"Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond."
Leonard,"I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever."
Leonard,Seriously?
Leonard,"That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
Leonard,When’s the screening?
Leonard,"Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in."
Leonard,You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
Leonard,"It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you."
Leonard,People do it all the time.
Leonard,"Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."
Leonard,You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
Leonard,"So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?"
Leonard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
Leonard,He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
Leonard,We’d still get in.
Leonard,Still get in.
Leonard,"We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair."
Leonard,"Oh, please don’t."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,"Boy, I wish I could say no."
Leonard,"Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here."
Leonard,"Buddy, let it go."
Leonard,You did everything you could.
Leonard,"Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
Leonard,How’d it go with my mother?
Leonard,Wow. Well done.
Leonard,"Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her."
Leonard,"Wait, we’re gonna get married again?"
Leonard,Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
Leonard,"Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her."
Leonard,"I just said why, we don’t like her."
Leonard,Is your brother out of prison?
Leonard,I’d love it if my dad could come.
Leonard,"Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half."
Leonard,"Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding."
Leonard,"I know, and there’s no excuse for that."
Leonard,"I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that."
Leonard,"Oh, we have to use the stairs."
Leonard,"Uh, I don’t, any day now."
Leonard,"Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here."
Leonard,Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
Leonard,"Thanks, Dad."
Leonard,"Hey, we’re here."
Leonard,"Dad, you remember Sheldon."
Leonard,"This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary."
Leonard,"And his girlfriend, Amy."
Leonard,"And, of course, Mom."
Leonard,"All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?"
Leonard,Mom.
Leonard,"Mom, please save something for the toast."
Leonard,Is that Howard in front of us?
Leonard,I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.
Leonard,What is his hurry?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
Leonard,"Okay, Mom, you sit over there."
Leonard,"Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be."
Leonard,"Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes."
Leonard,Cheers.
Leonard,"Sure, Dad."
Leonard,What is happening there?
Leonard,My father’s not texting me back.
Leonard,I don’t like it either.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
Leonard,Go to sleep.
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
Leonard,"Yeah, drive safe. "
Leonard,"Well, why? What’s wrong?"
Leonard,"Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay."
Leonard,"Here you are, Mother."
Leonard,I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
Leonard,"Yeah, special, like that.  That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
Leonard,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Leonard,You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
Leonard,"Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
Leonard,"Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
Leonard,Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
Leonard,"Fine, then you go."
Leonard,That still leaves me here with him.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,"Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley."
Leonard,"And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?"
Leonard,"Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute."
Leonard,That’s okay. I can make it over.
Leonard,That was almost a minute.
Leonard,So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
Leonard,What’s up?
Leonard,Really?
Leonard,"You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
Leonard,There goes our big payday.
Leonard,"You do that, too?"
Leonard,Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.
Leonard,That’s not a bad idea.
Leonard,"You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all."
Leonard,That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
Leonard,Hi. 
Leonard,I saw it. It’s big.
Leonard,"Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
Leonard,"‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people."
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,I’m getting enraged.
Leonard,Don’t speak.
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,"Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
Leonard,Where did you go to school?
Leonard,I don’t know how I feel about this.
Leonard,That’s a lot less big.
Leonard,"Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
Leonard,"Oh, thanks, man. "
Leonard,"Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
Leonard,"Oh, looks like it."
Leonard,Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
Leonard,I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
Leonard,Is that a retinal scanner?
Leonard,No way.
Leonard,"Oh, my turn, my turn."
Leonard,I didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
Leonard,"Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
Leonard,We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
Leonard,"Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try"
Leonard,"It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up."
Leonard,"Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed."
Leonard,What is this?
Leonard,"Oh, that is so nice."
Leonard,"So, what are you guys gonna do today?"
Leonard,You don’t think you’ll be bored?
Leonard,"Look at that, it is a party."
Leonard,"Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"
Leonard,Are you okay?
Leonard,"According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,So?
Leonard,You only had one.
Leonard,We can’t afford to lose any more time.
Leonard,"That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
Leonard,"Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
Leonard,You don’t.
Leonard,"No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
Leonard,Your problem.
Leonard,Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
Leonard,"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care."
Leonard,Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
Leonard,"Yes, you can."
Leonard,Seriously?
Leonard,"It’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
Leonard,It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? 
Leonard,"Um, I don’t really know how to say this."
Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sir."
Leonard,Sir.
Leonard,"I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, sir."
Leonard,That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
Leonard,Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
Leonard,"And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction."
Leonard,It’s only for five weeks.
Leonard,You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.
Leonard,"Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
Leonard,"And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
Leonard,That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.
Leonard,Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.
Leonard,I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this. 
Leonard,"Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes."
Leonard,Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
Leonard,"He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
Leonard,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Leonard,You guys have fun.
Leonard,"I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together."
Leonard,Good night.
Leonard,"That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
Leonard,"It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different."
Leonard,I know exactly what we are gonna do.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
Leonard,"Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
Leonard,I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
Leonard,"The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
Leonard,You were right. 
Leonard,I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?
Leonard,"If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Eh.
Leonard,Do it.
Leonard,I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.
Leonard,Won’t.
Leonard,Don’t.
Leonard,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
Leonard,"Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference."
Leonard,"When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating."
Leonard,"Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here."
Leonard,"Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
Leonard,"No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space."
Leonard,"Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst."
Leonard,"I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed."
Leonard,Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.
Leonard,"And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
Leonard,"Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier."
Leonard,Yeah. My record was six.
Leonard,"No, don’t do that."
Leonard,"Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
Leonard,"Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?"
Leonard,And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
Leonard,And who got him to try a turkey dog?
Leonard,How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
Leonard,Of course you do.
Leonard,Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.
Leonard,What do you think?
Leonard,How you guys doing?
Leonard,Why does she get that? We never got that.
Leonard,I’m very happy for you.
Leonard,Did we really need to be here for this?
Leonard,‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
Leonard,That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
Leonard,When is it?
Leonard,What? Why not?
Leonard,"Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun."
Leonard,"You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
Leonard,"Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph."
Leonard,"Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
Leonard,Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?"
Leonard,"Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck."
Leonard,Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
Leonard,"Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. "
Leonard,"Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it. "
Leonard,Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
Leonard,Would you like an autograph?
Leonard,That’ll be four seventy-five.
Leonard,"But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good."
Leonard,"Okay, let’s keep it moving."
Leonard,Should’ve punched that guy.
Leonard,Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
Leonard,No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
Leonard,"No, no, no. It’s not okay."
Leonard,I’m her husband.
Leonard,I am.
Leonard,"Well, she moved in across the hall."
Leonard,Like a river carves a canyon.
Leonard,That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
Leonard,And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
Leonard,"The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
Leonard,Yeah. I said no.
Leonard,I just wanted to make her work for it.
Leonard,She makes more money than I do.
Leonard,"It’s cute, they’re having fun living together."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Leonard,"So, she’s just been lying to him?"
Leonard,"Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
Leonard,So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
Leonard,"You’re awful quiet, everything okay?"
Leonard,I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
Leonard,"Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago."
Leonard,She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it."
Leonard,Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
Leonard,"Well, of course not."
Leonard,"Uh, no. "
Leonard,Are you kidding me?
Leonard,"Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone."
Leonard,"I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month."
Leonard,Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there he is."
Leonard,"Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, I’m going blind."
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,jISovbe’ 
Leonard,ghobe’ 
Leonard,"Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
Leonard,"Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone."
Leonard,You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
Leonard,Where’s Batman?
Leonard,And?
Leonard,"Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den."
Leonard,But you won’t be living here.
Leonard,But you won’t be living here.
Leonard,You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
Leonard,"Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours."
Leonard,Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
Leonard,"I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy."
Leonard,I really do.
Leonard,Yeah? What are you keeping?
Leonard,What about my robot poster?
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Sheldon."
Leonard,Over my assless chaps you will.
Leonard,Do you know what you need to do now?
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
Leonard,"I love you, too."
Leonard,"Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny."
Leonard,Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
Leonard,How’s that broccoli?
Leonard,"Oh, so she’s an astronomer?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, good luck with it."
Leonard,"I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive."
Leonard,Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
Leonard,That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
Leonard,"Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
Leonard,"Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two."
Leonard,"I’m sorry, is that a yes?"
Leonard,That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
Leonard,"That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too."
Leonard,How much money did he win?
Leonard,Wow.
Leonard,Right. Be polite.
Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
Leonard,"I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard."
Leonard,"Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
Leonard,They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
Leonard,It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
Leonard,"Hey, I’m trying to help you."
Leonard,"You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…"
Leonard,"Really, why?"
Leonard,"I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head."
Leonard,"I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix."
Leonard,"Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
Leonard,Let it fly.
Leonard,Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
Leonard,"Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine."
Leonard,"Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video."
Leonard,You’re up.
Leonard,"If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too."
Leonard,Does it spin around and do tricks?
Leonard,Then yeah.
Leonard,"Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
Leonard,I think he might be learning on his own.
Leonard,"Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures."
Leonard,"It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges."
Leonard,I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
Leonard,"Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
Leonard,"Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma."
Leonard,"Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
Leonard,"Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care."
Leonard,Do not tell Wolowitz.
Leonard,"Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool."
Leonard,"Yes, you do."
Leonard,"Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
Leonard,"Fine, take the plant."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock."
Leonard,So you think you should keep it?
Leonard,"Keep the clock, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Let me guess, you want it."
Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care."
Leonard,"Well, now they’re yours."
Leonard,"Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
Leonard,You know what? There is one thing I would like.
Leonard,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
Leonard,"Yeah, I like this one."
Leonard,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
Leonard,"Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it."
Leonard,Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
Leonard,"Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password."
Leonard,"Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs."
Leonard,"You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too."
Leonard,"All right, I tried."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Separating my delicates.
Leonard,"No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy."
Leonard,"No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?"
Leonard,"Uh, can I help you?"
Leonard,"Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing? "
Leonard,And just leave him here alone?
Leonard,"Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
Leonard,This is ridiculous.
Leonard,"Sheldon, get out here."
Leonard,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
Leonard,Because you were being selfish.
Leonard,Why? I said I didn’t care.
Leonard,"Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
Leonard,"Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone."
Leonard,No. 
Leonard,"Well, I’d like that, too. "
Leonard,You promise?
Leonard,Good?
Leonard,"Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there."
Leonard,"Damn, I need my inhaler."
Leonard,"No, I went down the stairs too fast."
Leonard,"I found it, but it’s empty."
Leonard,Are you sure? I’d really like to.
Leonard,"Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex."
Leonard,"If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
Leonard,"Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?"
Leonard,Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
Leonard,"Come on, everyone to the hospital."
Leonard,"Well, it is their child."
Leonard,It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
Leonard,"It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come."
Leonard,"Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
Leonard,"Sorry, Stuart."
Leonard,I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
Leonard,"Oh, like Halley’s comet."
Leonard,Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
Leonard,"Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter."
Leonard,"Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win."
Leonard,Did you at least have a good flight down there?
Leonard,"And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice."
Leonard,Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
Leonard,Who knows what he has down there.
Leonard,Absolutely not.
Leonard,Absolutely not.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,And their Sherpas.
Leonard,"On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
Leonard,It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
Leonard,"Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me. "
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con."
Leonard,"Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan."
Leonard,Stupid idea.
Leonard,"For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
Leonard,You know how easily I blister.
Leonard,"Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,Do not need a break.
Leonard,"If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break."
Leonard,Yeah?
Leonard,You want to decorate it tonight?
Leonard,"By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it."
Leonard,Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
Leonard,Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.
Leonard,See you guys at work.
Leonard,"Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice."
Leonard,"Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?"
Leonard,and this wine is why.
Leonard,I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
Leonard,"Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself."
Leonard,"Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep."
Leonard,I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
Leonard,"Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game."
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
Leonard,Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
Leonard,"If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me."
Leonard,"So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night."
Leonard,Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
Leonard,"Oh, no. Good game."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Just ignore him.
Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on with you?"
Leonard,"Well, hey, come on, just tell me."
Leonard,What? Where is this coming from?
Leonard,That is ridiculous. 
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?"
Leonard,"Fine, go ahead."
Leonard,Mm-hmm.
Leonard,Have fun.
Leonard,"Go ahead, it’s fine."
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,Earl grey?
Leonard,Honey?
Leonard,Unsweetened almond…
Leonard,"Sorry, thank you."
Leonard,I really don’t know.
Leonard,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
Leonard,Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
Leonard,I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
Leonard,"I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got. "
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,I came here to apologize.
Leonard,"Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort. "
Leonard,I don’t understand what you want.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple."
Leonard,"Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule. "
Leonard,What do you say?
Leonard,Does it really need to say that?
Leonard,"Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it. "
Leonard,"Me, too."
Leonard,What’s going on with that woman you’re dating?
Leonard,Why?
Leonard,"Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup."
Leonard,You’re not being very nice.
Leonard,"Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey."
Leonard,And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.
Leonard,That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
Leonard,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
Leonard,I don’t like trains. You like trains.
Leonard,"Well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
Leonard,"No, Raj, that’s a terrible idea."
Leonard,"Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work."
Leonard,"Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?"
Leonard,"Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
Leonard,"Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?"
Leonard,Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.
Leonard,"Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother."
Leonard,Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.
Leonard,"Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
Leonard,How’s it working out?
Leonard,"That’s great, I’m happy for you."
Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,I said no.
Leonard,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.
Leonard,"I’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
Leonard,Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.
Leonard,Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.
Leonard,"If you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!"
Leonard,Has he ever had his own place?
Leonard,Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
Leonard,Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.
Leonard,We owe you an apology.
Leonard,That was six years ago. I’m talking about tonight.
Leonard,"And, sorry about the suitcase."
Leonard,"Mm, Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit."
Leonard,"Oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you."
Leonard,So you’re gonna throw me under the bus?
Leonard,That’s because we are.
Leonard,We can’t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.
Leonard,"Nicely done, Howard."
Leonard,"Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
Leonard,"That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go."
Leonard,Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Leonard,"Fine, go for a little walk."
Leonard,Just keep walking.
Leonard,At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
Leonard,You’re kidding.
Leonard,"You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time."
Leonard,"You can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
Leonard,"Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present."
Leonard,"Yeah. Go ahead, open it."
Leonard,Okay. Where were we?
Leonard,This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
Leonard,"Four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
Leonard,Colonel Williams. Sir.
Leonard,"As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool."
Leonard,"Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need."
Leonard,"It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out."
Leonard,"Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
Leonard,"Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?"
Leonard,"Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out."
Leonard,"Come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?"
Leonard,Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out.
Leonard,"Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?"
Leonard,"It’s classified. If we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble."
Leonard,Just keep thinking. I got it.
Leonard,"No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair."
Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all."
Leonard,No.
Leonard,Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
Leonard,Just look at the board.
Leonard,"Oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff."
Leonard,"And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Leonard,You can do this.
Leonard,"This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
Leonard,"But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath."
Leonard,How ya doing?
Leonard,"Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants."
Leonard,"Yes, he is."
Leonard,"Aw, that used to work with Sheldon."
Leonard,Who forgot to crack the window?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,What’s going on with your dad?
Leonard,But all you did was complain when he did that.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
Leonard,"I’m trying, but I’m judging."
Leonard,"Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine."
Leonard,Do you know how much your car costs?
Leonard,Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.
Leonard,"Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?"
Leonard,What if he lives in your garage?
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you."
Leonard,What brought that on?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,We’re helping Raj figure out his finances.
Leonard,What is Pink Cheeks?
Leonard,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
Leonard,"We don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
Leonard,"No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job."
Leonard,She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
Leonard,"Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her."
Leonard,That I would do to her.
Leonard,See? Miserable.
Leonard,"Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
Leonard,"Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are."
Leonard,"I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel."
Leonard,"Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share. "
Leonard,"Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go."
Leonard,"Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail."
Leonard,"I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
Leonard,"Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique."
Leonard,"Yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
Leonard,"Yeah, of course, why?"
Leonard,"Oh, why? Do you not want to go?"
Leonard,"No, I want you to go."
Leonard,Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.
Leonard,Is that nice?
Leonard,"Uh, it’s more complicated than that."
Leonard,Do you think she’s as honest with you?
Leonard,"Sure, or you can."
Leonard,I don’t have a problem with your driving.
Leonard,"He wasn’t in a car, but okay."
Leonard,I honestly don’t.
Leonard,"If you want to drive, just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated."
Leonard,That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.
Leonard,Why would I be upset?
Leonard,"Well, I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time."
Leonard,Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?
Leonard,"O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?"
Leonard,"All right, problem solved."
Leonard,Now you can come with us.
Leonard,"You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too."
Leonard,Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.
Leonard,"Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?"
Leonard,"Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?"
Leonard,"No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean."
Leonard,"We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him."
Leonard,Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?
Leonard,"Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
Leonard,"You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
Leonard,It’s the least we can do.
Leonard,I don’t have a loofah.
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Yeah, for a little while."
Leonard,And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.
Leonard,Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.
Leonard,Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.
Leonard,I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms.
Leonard,Hey. 
Leonard,Perfect timing. Food’s ready.
Leonard,"You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow."
Leonard,"I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother."
Leonard,Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems.
Leonard,"Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone."
Leonard,"Well, now that you point it out…"
Leonard,We do seem to keep finding room mates.
Leonard,Did you know Raj moved out last night?
Leonard,"Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building."
Leonard,Should we go bring him back?
Leonard,"Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing."
Leonard,"Well, great."
Leonard,"Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building."
Leonard,"You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
Leonard,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.
Leonard,It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.
Leonard,"Sure. You’re living here for free, I guess I owe you."
Leonard,Bye.
Leonard,"Well, she’s done."
Leonard,He does raise an interesting point.
Leonard,"I understand it, Sheldon."
Leonard,Who’s Paul?
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?"
Leonard,Jerry?
Leonard,Tina?
Leonard,I went to your office Christmas party?
Leonard,I’d still like to know who Jerry is.
Leonard,That would be great. Thank you.
Leonard,"Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game."
Leonard,"I mean, they didn’t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel."
Leonard,"Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
Leonard,"Oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right, Halley?"
Leonard,"I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable."
Leonard,"A little, until I saw them in matching tops."
Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
Leonard,"I know, but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
Leonard,"You know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,I’m sure I’m overreacting.
Leonard,I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.
Leonard,"Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out."
Leonard,Thank you. I just feel…
Leonard,"Well, to be truthful…"
Leonard,Thank you. I…
Leonard,"Hey, Olsen twins…"
Leonard,"Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
Leonard,"I don’t know, you pretty much covered it."
Leonard,"Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
Leonard,"Yeah, why?"
Leonard,We’ve had this planned for a week.
Leonard,"I’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
Leonard,When does that start?
Leonard,It’s getting harder to pretend.
Leonard,"It can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, it’s seven."
Leonard,Seven.
Leonard,"I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once."
Leonard,"I don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
Leonard,You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
Leonard,She’s kidding.
Leonard,How could you lose that?
Leonard,"Well, it’s not across the hall."
Leonard,"But, boy, it is funny to think about."
Leonard,"Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
Leonard,Ask him.
Leonard,You understood the math?
Leonard,That’s just great.
Leonard,I honestly don’t remember.
Leonard,So Howard back Monday?
Leonard,Hey. Want to join us?
Leonard,"So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."
Leonard,"Hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?"
Leonard,Don’t you have any friends he can date?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Is that it?
Leonard,"No, it’s always him."
Leonard,"So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
Leonard,Nice try. I’m not going.
Leonard,"Mm, just down there."
Leonard,And we lived happily ever after. 
Leonard,O-o-o-o-oh.
Leonard,That’s actually funny.
Leonard,"Oh, hello. Join us."
Leonard,"Wow, that’s a big step."
Leonard,Is that Bert?
Leonard,"If you’re that upset, go get her back."
Leonard,You called on him.
Leonard,You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us.
Leonard,"It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time."
Leonard,We’re pinned down.
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
Leonard,Aw.
Leonard,"Doing it right now. Oh, they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow."
Leonard,"Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
Leonard,Hot dogs.
Leonard,You’re gonna have to be more specific.
Leonard,More.
Leonard,"Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad."
Leonard,"How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
Leonard,"I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk."
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
Leonard,"Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
Leonard,"It’ll be fine, let’s just go."
Leonard,Aaargh.
Leonard,"Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep."
Leonard,"I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away."
Leonard,"Oh, I know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny."
Leonard,"She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
Leonard,"Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?"
Leonard,Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
Leonard,"Yeah, it’s weird."
Leonard,"No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers."
Leonard,Uh.
Leonard,"Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out."
Leonard,"No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb."
Leonard,"We covered this, I’m dumb."
Leonard,So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?
Leonard,"Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,So you think it’s okay?
Leonard,Hi.
Leonard,That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?
Leonard,"Yeah, sorry."
Leonard,"Well, thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like."
Leonard,"Well, I don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I’ll find a way to deal with it."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up."
Leonard,"Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying."
Leonard,Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.
Leonard,Not if I want to be doing this later.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
Leonard,"First thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it."
Leonard,"Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we…"
Leonard,Where is everything?
Leonard,"It’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us."
Leonard,"Sir, I, I, I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?"
Leonard,Are you implementing phase two?
Leonard,I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.
Leonard,"Third floor, wrong apartment."
Leonard,"She might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything."
Leonard,"You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
Leonard,"Yeah, what’s going on with you guys?"
Leonard,"Oh, no. When?"
Leonard,"So, are you excited to have your own place again?"
Leonard,"Ah, we’ll miss you, too."
Leonard,I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?
Leonard,"Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re being silly."
Leonard,Do you really care about that last one?
Leonard,"Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend."
Leonard,"All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy…"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Should we give them their privacy?
Leonard,"Well, the last three nights I’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I’m doing with Amy gone."
Leonard,Shut up.
Leonard,"Oh, that would be great."
Leonard,Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.
Leonard,He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,Oh. I love those.
Leonard,"Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
Leonard,"Knowing Sheldon, nothing."
Leonard,"He just made her laugh, something’s wrong."
Leonard,"Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?"
Leonard,"Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars."
Leonard,If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.
Leonard,"Eh, I’m worth it."
Leonard,Like what?
Leonard,"No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
Leonard,You kept walking. I think you did.
Leonard,"Yeah, she’s definitely going after Sheldon."
Leonard,And you actually got in a pool?
Leonard,"Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
Leonard,You think you should call Amy?
Leonard,"You got feet and legs, you do it."
Leonard,Our pleasure.
Leonard,I don’t know.
Leonard,I’ll do the talking.
Leonard,"Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math. "
Leonard,"Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go."
Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on."
Leonard,"You don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… God, that’s a good song. "
Leonard,"Here comes our new boss, be polite."
Leonard,"Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something."
Leonard,"Hey, what’s the matter? "
Leonard,"You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she’s still going to be right. "
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,"Hey Penny, come on in."
Leonard,You have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t…."
Leonard,Stop it.
Leonard,Vulcan nerve pinch!
Leonard,What? 
Leonard,"What, what, what, what, what? "
Leonard,"Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,I’m at work. 
Leonard,"No, don’t, don’t…."
Leonard,"A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. "
Leonard,My turn on the time machine. 
Leonard,"Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
Leonard,"Um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate. "
Leonard,"Hey, sorry I couldn’t find a parking spot, how are you doing."
Leonard,Hey! 
Leonard,"Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn’t want to talk…"
Leonard,Sorry.
Leonard,I’m back. 
Leonard,"…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…"
Leonard,Two seats right there. 
Leonard,What does that mean?
Leonard,"Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?"
Leonard,Hey Penny.
Leonard,Hi Sheldon.
Leonard,Science?
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,Hoo-boy.
Leonard,"Hey, wh-where are you going?"
Leonard,A-a-a-aw!
Leonard,"Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I’ll get him. Sheldon, it’s for you."
Leonard,"Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there."
Leonard,"Oh, hi, Steph, come on in."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Hey, guys!"
Leonard,"I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation."
Leonard,"Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!"
Leonard,Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven."
Leonard,Thanks.
Leonard,"Dude, check it out. That’s laundry for a month!"
Leonard,"Okay, how’s that?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?"
Leonard,Do not make a sound.
Leonard,Okay-dokay
Leonard,"Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
Leonard,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
Leonard,Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
Leonard,Laser.
Leonard,What the…?
Leonard,"What! What, what, what?"
Leonard,"Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?"
Leonard,"Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day."
Leonard,Hey.
Leonard,"Hey, where’ve you been?"
Leonard,"First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
Leonard,"It’s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
Leonard,"Yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
Leonard,"Aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
Leonard,"You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat."
Leonard,You’re not even watching!
Leonard,"Oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
Leonard,"You’re insane, you know that?!"
Leonard,"Hey, Howard, what’s up?"
Leonard,25 cats!
Leonard,Keep going. I’m listening.
Leonard,Who is it?
Leonard,We’re going to have to be very quiet.
Leonard,"Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary."
Leonard,"Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex."
Leonard,"Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?"
Leonard,Or it could be sy-fee.
Leonard,"Uh-oh, that’s Priya."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it."
Leonard,"Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!"
Leonard,I think he’s getting worse.
Leonard,"You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection."
Leonard,"Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship."
Leonard,"I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching."
Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
Leonard,Too casual?
Leonard,Excuse me.
Leonard,‘Sup?
Leonard,"You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go."
Leonard,Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
Leonard,"I’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
Leonard,You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.
Leonard,‘sup?
Leonard,"Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"I’m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I’m sorry Alex hit on me, I’d no idea I’m cute."
Leonard,"Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off."
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening."
Leonard,"Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?"
Leonard,That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
Leonard,Hello.
Leonard,"Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?"
Leonard,"Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle."
Leonard,"Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?"
Leonard,Little ball of fur.
Leonard,You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.
Leonard,You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
Leonard,I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
Leonard,"Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it."
Leonard,"It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there."
Leonard,U-u-u-uh!
Leonard,"Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here."
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Leonard,"Ah, push it."
Leonard,Push it real good.
Leonard,"All right, pressure’s off"
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,"Come on, we’re going to the hospital."
Leonard,I hope it kills us both.
Howard,"I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke."
Howard,Right.
Leonard,"You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
Howard,And you just assume you’re always right?
Howard,So do I.
Howard,Why?
Howard,"So, I get the draft?"
Howard,Fine. And it’s a dickey.
Howard,"Yeah, we can go over to my place."
Howard,You’re not going with us.
Howard,I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!
Howard,"No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!"
Howard,"She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
Howard,Three. I designed the engine myself.
Howard,"Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on."
Howard,I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! 
Howard,Nice.
Howard,What’s happening?
Howard,You’re waiting for the elevator?
Leonard,"Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment."
Leonard,Yeah.
Leonard,What?
Leonard,Dr. Cooper?
Leonard,I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
Leonard,What?
Leonard,"Uh, radon?"
Leonard,Telling you? Telling you.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk."
Leonard,"I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
Leonard,There’s three?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,What’s the difference?
Leonard,Can you do that?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, experimental physics."
Leonard,What is that?
Leonard,Yes.
Leonard,"A car, yeah."
Leonard,"Well, can’t you drive?"
Leonard,"Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?"
Leonard,"Come on, I just asked."
Leonard,"Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
Leonard,"Oh, good. I passed the barriers."
Leonard,"Uh, I guess."
Leonard,When I have to.
Leonard,"I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight."
Leonard,Fine. I’ll take it.
Leonard,Is this it?
Leonard,So where do you sleep?
Leonard,"If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke."
Leonard,On occasion.
Leonard,Does that really need to be in the agreement?
Leonard,We have a flag?
Leonard,Okay.
Leonard,Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
Leonard,I’m sure he’ll go away.
Leonard,What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
Leonard,I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
Leonard,"But, Joyce, come on."
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too."
Leonard,"Yeah, not a good idea."
Leonard,"Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up."
Leonard,They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
Leonard,"According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
Leonard,I did notify you.
Leonard,What am I doing in your spam folder?
Leonard,"Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!"
Leonard,Why not?
Leonard,I like it.
Leonard,There you go– three against one.
Leonard,But I said no to that.
Leonard,We can fix that. Let’s leave.
Leonard,That your dad?
Leonard,"Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?"
Leonard,"Oh, this just might be your lucky day."
Leonard,"The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work."
Leonard,There’s no mistake.
Leonard,"Well, I’ve adjusted the formula."
Leonard,"Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh."
Leonard,A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
Leonard,Oh. Right.
Leonard,What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time. 
Leonard,"Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
Penny,Not pregnant. Yes!
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Tushie is buttocks, right?"
Raj,Hilarious.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. "
Raj,"Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
Raj,Why?
Raj,Fine.
Raj,"Me, too."
Raj,You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
Raj,Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
Raj,Cool.
Raj,Wait. It’s here.
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,"I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?"
Sheldon,You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
Sheldon,Are you asking me or telling me?
Sheldon,"All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?"
Sheldon,Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
Sheldon,That depends.
Sheldon,"No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
Sheldon,Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
Sheldon,No! That’s where I sit!
Sheldon,"This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
Sheldon,"Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
Sheldon,Hmm.
Sheldon,Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?
Sheldon,And you have a vehicle?
Sheldon,And you’ll be willing to drive me?
Sheldon,I can. I choose not to.
Sheldon,Why don’t you let me do this.
Sheldon,"Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
Sheldon,"That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment."
Sheldon,The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
Sheldon,This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
Sheldon,"When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies."
Sheldon,I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
Sheldon,Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
Sheldon,"No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room."
Sheldon,I don’t understand.
Sheldon,Do you do this often?
Sheldon,Your room. You may want to repaint. 
Sheldon,Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.
Sheldon,"We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
Sheldon,"Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
Sheldon,Well that’s disappointing. 
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon, Leonard?Leonard?
Sheldon,I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer.  Leonard?
Sheldon,"You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”"
Sheldon,12 hours? 
Sheldon,What is going on here?
Sheldon,I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
Sheldon,Explain the couch.
Sheldon,But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
Sheldon,Did it occur to you that was by design?
Sheldon,"But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
Sheldon,"Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter."
Sheldon,"I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
Sheldon,"I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.
Sheldon,I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
Sheldon,We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
Sheldon,Because no one likes Babylon 5.
Sheldon,"They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
Sheldon,And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
Sheldon,There’s a draft on my neck over here.
Sheldon,You’re protected by your turtleneck.
Sheldon,"Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here."
Sheldon,Wait. Let me get my jacket.
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. "
Sheldon,Won’t work.
Sheldon,"You don’t see your mistake, do you?"
Sheldon,"This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
Sheldon,Not correctly.
Sheldon,Give me that. 
Sheldon,You’re welcome. 
Penny,"Leonard, I said not now."
Penny,I said not now. 
Penny,Who are you?
Penny,"Oh, hi!"
Penny,Hi?
Penny,"Oh, that’s nice."
Penny,"Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Hi. 
Penny,"Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime."
Penny,Great. 
Penny,Bye.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Hi. 
Penny,"Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?"
Penny,"Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to."
Penny,"So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"
Penny,"Okay, thankyou."
Penny,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?"
Penny,Wow.
Penny,"So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
Penny,This is really impressive.
Penny,Holy smokes.
Penny,"Uh, do you guys mind if I start?"
Penny,"So, sit next to me. "
Penny,What’s the difference?
Penny,Do you want me to move?
Penny,"So, Klingon boggle?"
Penny,"Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
Penny,Participate in the what?
Penny,"Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. "
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,"Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,"No, I’m from Omaha. "
Penny,"I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny."
Penny,It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. 
Penny,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. "
Penny,"I just, I can’t believe I trusted him."
Penny,"You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?"
Penny,"Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work."
Penny,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
Penny,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
Penny,"Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!"
Penny,Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,Okay. Thanks. 
Penny,"Hey, Leonard?"
Penny,"Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour."
Penny,It’s okay if you say no.
Penny,It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.
Penny,"Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?"
Penny,"Really, why?"
Penny,"Wow, cool tiger."
Penny,"Uh, sounds interesting."
Penny,"Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it."
Penny,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Penny,"I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass."
Penny,"Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
Penny,Sure.
Penny,So?
Penny,So?
Penny,Any ideas Raj? 
Penny,That sounds like fun.
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Penny,Am I interrupting.
Penny,Sounds like you have company.
Penny,"Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them."
Penny,"Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was…."
Penny,"Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so….  Oh! Hel…hello!"
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,"No, I haven’t."
Penny,"Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon."
Penny,"Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?"
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
Penny,"Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you."
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,"A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?"
Penny,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? "
Penny,"Yes, I know, men can’t fly."
Penny,I’m just going to go wash up.
Penny,Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
Penny,"Oh, great, thank you again ."
Penny,What’s he talking about?
Penny,I don’t get it.
Penny,Give me back my key.
Penny,Do you understand how creepy this is.
Penny,"In my apartment, while I was sleeping."
Penny,And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Penny,God!
Penny,Stay away from me.
Penny,"Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?"
Penny,"You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?"
Penny,"It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out."
Penny,"I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?"
Penny,That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll. 
Penny,Hi.
Penny,What’s going on?
Penny,Leonard.
Penny,"Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre. "
Penny,"Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store."
Penny,"Hey guys, I got this. "
Penny,"Guys, this is actually really simple."
Penny,"Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes. "
Penny,"Okay, this place does look pretty good."
Penny,"Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard."
Penny,"Is, is everything okay."
Penny,"Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mailman."
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you, again."
Penny,"Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?"
Penny,Supper?
Penny,"Uh, six thirty’s great."
Penny,"Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys."
Penny,"You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all’s coming?"
Penny,"Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
Penny,Six thirty.
Penny,It’s fine.
Penny,"No, six thirty’s great."
Penny,Why?
Penny,So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
Penny,"Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy."
Penny,How?
Penny,"So, what’s new in the world of physics?"
Penny,"Really, nothing?"
Penny,Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up. 
Penny,"Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well. "
Penny,"Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice and funny, but…"
Penny,I’d like a drink.
Penny,"Okay, well, you know, it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex."
Penny,"It’s just, it’s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know. "
Penny,"No, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it."
Penny,Emotionally.
Penny,How?
Penny,"Wow, centrifugal force!"
Penny,Are you okay?
Penny,No.
Penny,Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?
Penny,"I know, but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window. "
Penny,"Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?"
Penny,Was this supposed to be a date?
Penny,"Okay, I was just checking."
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,Four dozen?
Penny,"Okay, one more time?"
Penny,"Oh, yay!"
Penny,How come you didn’t go into work today.
Penny,"So you got canned, huh?"
Penny,"Well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens. "
Penny,"No, no, I meant…"
Penny,Never mind. 
Penny,We’re fine.
Penny,"Oh, sure I am."
Penny,120?
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Penny,"Let’s say 4,390. "
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs. "
Penny,"Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. "
Penny,Interesting.
Penny,"No, I mean what you find enjoyable. "
Penny,What now?
Penny,"Well, maybe that’s what I was going for. "
Penny,"Oh, I don’t know Sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today. "
Penny,What?
Penny,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
Penny,"Okay, I’m not talking about this with you."
Penny,Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?
Penny,Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
Penny,What happened?
Penny,"Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had."
Penny,Love?
Penny,"Hi, you guys ready to order?"
Penny,I’ll be back.
Penny,"Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. "
Penny,A shower. 
Penny,"Alright, thank you, and Sheldon."
Penny,"Well, it’s all good. "
Penny,"Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?"
Penny,The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. 
Penny,Because you are not at Big Boy!
Penny,"Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that. "
Penny,"Oh, wow, a girl scientist. "
Penny,"Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the cello?"
Penny,"Really?  I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two. "
Penny,"Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. "
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not. "
Penny,Well what?
Penny,"Oh, come on, you went to college."
Penny,"Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy. "
Penny,"Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. "
Penny,We really shouldn’t be standing here. 
Penny,"Oh, come on, you know, Leonard’s had girls over before, right?"
Penny,"Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?"
Penny,"So, do you know who’s in there?"
Penny,"Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night."
Penny,What’s the matter?
Penny,"Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie. "
Penny,"Oh, hey Leonard."
Penny,"So, how’s it going?"
Penny,"Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good. "
Penny,"Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. "
Penny,"So, is it serious, do you like her?"
Penny,"Alright, well, I’ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. "
Penny,"So, how’s everything. "
Penny,"Really, oh yay!"
Penny,"Um, I don’t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? "
Penny,"Oh, oh that’s too bad. Well hey, don’t worry, I’m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. ."
Penny,"So, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
Penny,"Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing…"
Penny,"Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween."
Penny,"Well, yeah. "
Penny,"Um, yeah, Halloween."
Penny,"As usual, I’m not following."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,Fine.
Penny,Of course.
Penny,"Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. "
Penny,Late? It’s 7:05.
Penny,"Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. "
Penny,"Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. "
Penny,"Probably, but in their own homes. "
Penny,The parade?
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. "
Penny,"No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute."
Penny,"No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be."
Penny,"Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. "
Penny,"Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?"
Penny,"Alright Kurt, be nice."
Penny,Kurt!
Penny,"Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard? "
Penny,"Okay, Kurt, please."
Penny,"Kurt, put him down this instant. "
Penny,"I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down. "
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay."
Penny,"Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. "
Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay."
Penny,I’m so sorry about what happened.
Penny,"Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. "
Penny,"Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… "
Penny,"God, what is wrong with me."
Penny,"Gah, I’m not perfect."
Penny,"You really think so, don’t you? "
Penny,Yeah. 
Penny,Just…. a lot. 
Penny,"It might. Boy, you’re really smart."
Penny,"Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you? "
Penny,I should probably go.
Penny,Hey guys. 
Penny,"No you won’t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while."
Penny,"Well, there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey, how’s California,” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it’s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me. "
Penny,"Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
Penny,He really needs to dial it down.
Penny,"Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family. "
Penny,"No, yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s Howard?"
Penny,"Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.    "
Penny,"Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play."
Penny,Why?
Penny,"Oh, what, what, what? "
Penny,"Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. "
Penny,"Ha-ha, there goes your head again."
Penny,"Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"
Penny,"Yeah, so is Sheldon. "
Penny,"Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. "
Penny,"This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it’s raining you! "
Penny,"Gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?"
Penny,"Well, it’s been fun."
Penny,Or we could just have a life. 
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Penny,"As usual, nice talking to you Raj  "
Penny,"Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom. "
Penny,"Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
Penny,"Uh, the couch is good."
Penny,Hu.. what?
Penny,How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
Penny,Thanks Leonard. 
Penny,I’m listening.
Penny,Why? 
Penny,I’ll risk it.
Penny,Anything else I should know.
Penny,That’s okay. 
Penny,Got it.
Penny,Thanks. 
Penny,"Uh, what time is it?"
Penny,I slept all day?
Penny,What the hell is your problem?
Penny,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
Penny,"That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie."
Penny,Y-you used my loofah?
Penny,You can keep that too.
Penny,"Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?"
Penny,"Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
Penny,"Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. "
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Yeah. Okay. So?
Penny,She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. 
Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend. "
Penny,"Well, for Penny it’s dancing night. "
Penny,No.
Penny,"Look, why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?"
Penny,"Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. "
Penny,"Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. "
Penny,Told yah! . 
Penny,I need some guinea pigs.
Penny,"I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I’m going to get the hang of talking to you. "
Penny,"Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks."
Penny,"So Leonard, how about it?"
Penny,"Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise. "
Penny,"Okay, Raj, what’ll it be?  "
Penny,"Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?"
Penny,"Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks."
Penny,"That’s, um, rum and coke without the rum."
Penny,So coke.
Penny,There’s a can in the fridge. 
Penny,Then swim to Cuba.
Penny,"Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who’s next?"
Penny,"Okay, you’re cut off. Anybody need a refill?"
Penny,A… are you talking to me?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I think that’s the grasshopper talking. "
Penny,"Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
Penny,"Um, Raj, honey, you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me."
Penny,I’m fine.
Penny,"Okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it. "
Penny,"Yeah, that. Uh, why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when I’m tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?"
Penny,Drinks do not work that way. 
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Oh, I’ll wedge it right in there. "
Penny,I know the reason. 
Penny,"Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty. "
Penny,"Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. "
Penny,It’s a little loud.
Penny,"Okay, thanks."
Penny,"Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. "
Penny,"Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they’re really cheap."
Penny,"Boy, that’s brilliant, but I’ll see you."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s a question, why? "
Penny,"Well, wait, wait, what’s on top of them. "
Penny,"What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. "
Penny,"So, how’s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? "
Penny,"Oh, hey, I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!"
Penny,"Okay, well, let’s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these."
Penny,"No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. "
Penny,"Seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. What’s this."
Penny,Uh-huh. 
Penny,"Oh, nice. "
Penny,"Here, why don’t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. "
Penny,"Well, where you going, just put them on. "
Penny,"Oh, are you shy? "
Penny,"Don’t worry, I won’t look. "
Penny,"Sweetie, put the pants on."
Penny,"So, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
Penny,What is this?
Penny,"Oh, why didn’t you wear it at Halloween?"
Penny,"Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt."
Penny,"If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?"
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, I don’t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?"
Penny,The… the eighth grade?
Penny,"Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit. "
Penny,"Yup.  I said no, put it down. "
Penny,Hey Sheldon! 
Penny,Get anything good? 
Penny,"Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I’m here all week. "
Penny,"Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…"
Penny,"Little misunderstanding, huh. "
Penny,"Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it. "
Penny,Well how do you feel?
Penny,Well I’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend. 
Penny,Wait… what? 
Penny,"You should just talk to him, I’m sure you guys can work this out. "
Penny,Which was? 
Penny,"Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
Penny,"Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn’t really understand it but…"
Penny,"Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words."
Penny,"Um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s "
Penny,You had a lucky hunch. 
Penny,"Uh, he… . "
Penny,Bye Sheldon. 
Penny,There you go. 
Penny,"No, no, I didn’t say better, I said less stained. "
Penny,Is that all?
Penny,"Oh, well, then good!"
Penny,"Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard it before. "
Penny,I really should have brought my own car. 
Penny,Is this usually how these physics things go?
Penny,You’ll never guess what just happened.
Penny,What was that?
Penny,"Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?"
Penny,"Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. "
Penny,"It’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. "
Penny,"It’s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?"
Penny,"Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. "
Penny,Do you have any idea what time it is? 
Penny,What do you want?
Penny,I remember symposium.
Penny,"Wait, what?"
Penny,Well imagine how I’m feeling. 
Penny,Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. 
Penny,"You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to. "
Penny,"It’s okay, Leonard "
Penny,Uh-huh!
Penny,Uh-huh!
Penny,"Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them."
Penny,"There’s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn’t that right Leonard. "
Penny,"It’s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian"
Penny,"Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
Penny,"No, look, Sheldon’s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man."
Penny,"Alright you guys, good luck."
Penny,Hi. How did the intervention go.
Penny,"Well, based on what you told me, I’m not surprised. "
Penny,"Hi Leo, how are you feeling?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. "
Penny,By the end. Yeah. 
Penny,I’m… I’m sorry.
Penny,"Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
Penny,"I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? "
Penny,"This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me."
Penny,"Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You’re gonna do okay. "
Penny,Did you get my mail.
Penny,"Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska."
Penny,"Boy, it’s good to be back. "
Penny,"Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
Penny,"Oh, the flu I guess."
Penny,Maybe Friday.
Penny,I… I don’t…
Penny,"Oh, it’s okay, I understand."
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail."
Penny,"No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Penny,"How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick."
Penny,"Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want."
Penny,You can have soup delivered.
Penny,"Okay, what kind of soup do you want."
Penny,We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek. 
Penny,No.
Penny,"Hey, where are you? "
Penny,You sound funny.
Penny,"Yeah, well I’m at work too, and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station. "
Penny,"He won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
Penny,Can you please come get him? 
Penny,"Oh, it’s okay, I didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like I have rent or car payments or anything."
Penny,"Okay, well, you feel better."
Penny,"Um, home, to write some bad cheques."
Penny,"Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before? "
Penny,"Really, never?"
Penny,Studying abroad?
Penny,And there was no-one there to take care of you?
Penny,Again?
Penny,What does that mean?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?"
Penny,"Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. "
Penny,"Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later."
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?"
Penny,But Sheldon….
Penny,I can’t believe I’m doing this. 
Penny,Sorry. 
Penny,What?
Penny,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it."
Penny,You rat bastard. 
Penny,You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon. 
Penny,"Uh, it’s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard’s home!"
Penny,"Sure. Raj, hug Howard. "
Penny,"I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? "
Penny,"So, you’ve got a bit of competition, I really don’t see what the big deal is. "
Penny,"I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? "
Penny,"You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
Penny,What?
Penny,Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. 
Penny,"Wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys. "
Penny,Zod?
Penny,I want tickets to that please. 
Penny,"Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?"
Penny,"You know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
Penny,"Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil."
Penny,"Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper."
Penny,That is correct.
Penny,"Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard."
Penny,Right. 
Penny,Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
Penny,Because it’s polite.
Penny,"Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. "
Penny,What did he say? 
Penny,"Yeah, and the bag it came in. "
Penny,"So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?"
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. "
Penny,Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down. 
Penny,"I’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?"
Penny,"Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
Penny,"Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God, Sean Penn!"
Penny,"I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?"
Penny,Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan. 
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,What is it?
Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so…."
Penny,"I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late."
Penny,"You’re joking, right?"
Penny,"Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof. "
Penny,"Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. "
Penny,"It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."
Penny,"Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…"
Penny,"No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…"
Penny,"Oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades."
Penny,"Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.  "
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so…."
Penny,"But, what about your time machine."
Penny,"Oh, I’m scared. "
Penny,"Oh, Leonard. "
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset."
Penny,"No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. "
Penny,Really?
Penny,Oh. Wow. Good for you. 
Penny,Hi Mike.
Penny,"Yeah, I just have to change."
Penny,"Oh, stop it! Bye guys. "
Penny,"Really, they have your little name label in them. "
Penny,"Wow, you don’t look that much alike."
Penny,"Hey, good for you, Raj."
Penny,"I didn’t say you were, I just said she was cute. "
Penny,"Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?"
Penny,"Missy, I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?"
Penny,You’re welcome. 
Penny,Goodbye Leonard! 
Penny,"Uh, pretty much, why?"
Penny,Of course.
Penny,"What do you want, Howard?"
Penny,Missy?
Penny,Missy?
Penny,"Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  "
Penny,"Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…"
Penny,"So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?"
Penny,"Okay, he can have carrot cake."
Penny,he can scrape it off. 
Penny,"I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody’s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."
Penny,"Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?"
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Shuddup, yeah you do. "
Penny,"Uh, that’s so silly."
Penny,"What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?” "
Penny,"Yeah, see, that’s what kids should have. "
Penny,So you’ve really never had a birthday party? 
Penny,And?
Penny,"Oh my God, that’s terrible. "
Penny,That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. 
Penny,I know. I want to talk to you. 
Penny,"Okay, can you just let me in."
Penny,"Okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday."
Penny,He just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one. 
Penny,"Howard, here’s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. "
Penny,Anguish?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. "
Penny,Nevertheless we are….
Penny,"Okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won’t know which, I’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. "
Penny,"Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?"
Penny,Is that Raj and Howard?
Penny,"So, what did you get the birthday boy?"
Penny,Nice. I got him a sweater. 
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, I didn’t see your present."
Penny,Well why not? 
Penny,"Well, Sheldon, you’re his friend. Friends give each other presents."
Penny,What?
Penny,It’s a non-optional social convention.
Penny,"Okay, let’s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. "
Penny,"And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up."
Penny,Entertain them.
Penny,Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. 
Penny,"Alright, you know they have DVDs over there."
Penny,"Sheldon, a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn’t buy for themselves."
Penny,"Well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print. "
Penny,"Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. "
Penny,Exactly.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,"Oh, okay then this one. "
Penny,"I don’t know, the man on the box looks so happy. "
Penny,"Oh, I know I’m going to regret this but, what trauma? "
Penny,Of course.
Penny,No? 
Penny,All of them.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Okay, so we’re getting this one?"
Penny,"Okay, let’s go."
Penny,"Here, buy this one. Look, it’s the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available. "
Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
Penny,"You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!” "
Penny,"Why, is Leonard okay."
Penny,"Okay, I don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. "
Penny,"Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I’ll point out which of my friends are easy. "
Penny,"I’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. "
Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
Penny,"Well, for one thing, we’re late for Leonard’s birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security. "
Penny,Keep walking.
Penny,"That’s my friend Carol. Remind me, I’ve got to introduce her to Howard. "
Penny,I’m so sorry you didn’t get your party.
Penny,Happy birthday anyways. 
Penny,"Oh, I’ll tell you what’s going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. "
Penny,GO AWAY!
Penny,I don’t. 
Penny,Wait. 
Penny,Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
Penny,"Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. "
Penny,"Well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?"
Penny,"I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. "
Penny,"You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."
Penny,"Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. "
Penny,"Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die."
Penny,Oh God!
Penny,Sandwich shop.
Penny,"No, at the sub shop we were only making out. "
Penny,"Really, do you think I overreacted?"
Penny,"‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise."
Penny,Yes. You’re right. I should just say I’m done with him. 
Penny,But I never gave the man a chance to explain. 
Penny,"No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. "
Penny,"No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. "
Penny,"I’m going over to Mike’s. Leonard, thank you so much."
Penny,I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault. 
Penny,"Well, I went over to Mike’s to make up with him."
Penny,But he had already moved on.
Penny,That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. 
Penny,How could he do that.
Penny,"I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
Penny,"You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. "
Penny,What about you what?
Penny,Are you asking me out?
Penny,Wow.
Penny,"No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally."
Penny,Yes. 
Penny,"Yes, I will go out with you. "
Penny,"Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?"
Penny,"I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second."
Penny,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.
Penny,"Well, Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. "
Penny,"All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best. "
Penny,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. "
Penny,No.
Penny,"Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out. "
Penny,"Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down? "
Penny,"Well, choose."
Penny,"Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. "
Penny,"Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…"
Penny,"Alright, yeah, I don’t really know who they are…"
Penny,"Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with."
Penny,"No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. "
Penny,"But on the other hand, if things don’t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don’t know, like you would say light years. "
Penny,Thank you for the clarification. 
Penny,"Right, thanks."
Penny,Not the first one I’ve made today. 
Penny,"Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I’m talking about. "
Penny,Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
Penny,Sheldon! 
Penny,"I’m sorry, I don’t get the point. "
Penny,"Sheldon, what’s the point? "
Penny,"Okay, so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard. "
Penny,Hi.
Penny,come on in.
Penny,Thank you. So do you. 
Penny,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. "
Penny,"Actually, I’ve heard far too much about Schrodinger’s Cat. "
Penny,"Alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner. "
Penny,"Oh, that’s very interesting."
Penny,"Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question."
Penny,Do you want some.
Penny,Right.
Penny,Got it. 
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,I didn’t feel a draft. 
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
Penny,"No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date."
Penny,Or we could just wing it. 
Penny,Goodnight Leonard.
Penny,"Sheldon, may I ask you a question? "
Penny,"Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. "
Penny,"No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac? "
Penny,How is that not a braniac? 
Penny,"So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. "
Penny,On what? 
Penny,No.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. "
Penny,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser. "
Penny,"You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. "
Penny,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. "
Penny,Yeah. 
Penny,What? 
Penny,"Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. "
Penny,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend. "
Penny,"Well, yeah. "
Penny,"Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday."
Penny,"You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
Penny,"Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…"
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m working."
Penny,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
Penny,"Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?"
Penny,"Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it."
Penny,What are you talking about.
Penny,He told you?
Penny,Pasadena city college? 
Penny,"Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree. "
Penny,"Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? "
Penny,"So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart. "
Penny,"Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go."
Penny,Bye guys.
Penny,Sheldon? What are you doing?
Penny,"Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?"
Penny,"Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?"
Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
Penny,Well then don’t order popcorn.
Penny,Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.
Penny,They have other things.
Penny,"I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…"
Penny,"Yeah, sure."
Penny,"Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists."
Penny,"Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya."
Penny,"No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard."
Penny,Leslie.
Penny,"Okay, well, goodnight.  "
Penny,"Had a great time, ciao "
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,"Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something."
Penny,Goodnight Sheldon.
Penny,Excuse me?
Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
Penny,Your arch enemy?
Penny,"Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it."
Penny,"Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry."
Penny,I know. I heard.
Penny,"Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends."
Penny,"Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…"
Penny,Are you going to let me talk?
Penny,"You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it."
Penny,"Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with."
Penny,Because love trumps hate.
Penny,Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
Penny,"Yes, I can’t get my stupid door open."
Penny,Yeah!
Penny,"Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
Penny,I can’t get the damned key out.
Penny,"Thankyou, Sheldon."
Penny,"Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?"
Penny,"I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it."
Penny,"I did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here."
Penny,No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. 
Penny,"No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."
Penny,For God’s sake! 
Penny,Sheldor?
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,What’s AFK?
Penny,OIC.
Penny,"Oh, I see?"
Penny,"Oh, I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?"
Penny,"Leonard, guess what, I’m a level three warrior."
Penny,"Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!"
Penny,"Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?"
Penny,"Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?"
Penny,"Oh my God, a treasure chest, I’m rich!"
Penny,"Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon."
Penny,"Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain."
Penny,"No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger."
Penny,"Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?"
Penny,Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
Penny,"Thank you, I really appreciate this."
Penny,"Don’t patronise me, just get the sword."
Penny,"Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. ."
Penny,"No danger, look, it’s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?"
Penny,Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
Penny,"Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?"
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Well, wear different pyjamas."
Penny,"Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?"
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character."
Penny,"Really? Boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians."
Penny,"No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!"
Penny,Busy.
Penny,I don’t work on Mondays.
Penny,"Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?"
Penny,"Yeah, get to the point, I’m about to level up here."
Penny,"Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s back online."
Penny,"Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I’m going in."
Penny,Got it.
Penny,22
Penny,"Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?"
Penny,"I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies."
Penny,"Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn’t working, die you undead mummy, die!"
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,That’s on the registration?
Penny,"Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I’m a big old five."
Penny,"Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I’m here, I’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank."
Penny,"No, no, no, no, I need you now."
Penny,"Whatever, I’ll figure it out myself."
Penny,"Oh my God, I need help.  "
Penny,I’m the dumplings.
Penny,"Creepy, Howard."
Penny,Sit over there.
Penny,What do you have….
Penny,I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
Penny,"Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself."
Penny,"No, it’s okay, between  "
Penny,What are you guys talking about?
Penny,"And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?"
Penny,"Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters."
Penny,"Of course I would, I would be honoured."
Penny,Shame on you guys. 
Penny,"Oh, Raj, look at you!"
Penny,"Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?"
Penny,"Oh, I’m ready."
Penny,"Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?"
Penny,"Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get."
Penny,"Uh, come on, good night Leonard."
Penny,"Alright, come on, come on."
Penny,"Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj."
Penny,Yes it is.
Penny,"Oh, wow, is the evening over."
Penny,"Wait, meet them."
Penny,I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
Penny,"No, no, there’s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face."
Penny,"I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. "
Penny,Thanks for the update 
Penny,"Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do."
Penny,"Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?"
Penny,"Yes, Sheldon, we are friends."
Penny,"Oh, dear God."
Penny,"You know this is my day off, Sheldon."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month."
Penny,"Sheldon, it’s fine."
Penny,"Uh, maybe the light’s broken."
Penny,What?
Penny,Do you have any alcohol?
Penny,Too bad.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Well, good for Leonard."
Penny,No.
Penny,No.
Penny,How about we just have a little quiet time now?
Penny,"I said, get out."
Penny,"Sheldon, you know  that we care about you."
Penny,"You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie."
Penny,"All right, come on Sheldon."
Penny,What?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Fine.
Penny,All right! 
Penny,"Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?"
Penny,Doing what?
Penny,"Well, how ’bout when you were 17?"
Penny,"Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C."
Penny,"Come on, let’s go."
Penny,I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order.  See? Sorry."
Penny,Where you going?
Penny,"Oh, are you here to see Leonard?"
Penny,Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
Penny,"Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?"
Penny,Sheldon Cooper?
Penny,I need to see this.
Penny,"Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet."
Penny,"You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?"
Penny,"Come on, everybody has a deal."
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,"Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares."
Penny,What are you guys gonna do?
Penny,"Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight."
Penny,"Hey, guys, this package came for y…"
Penny,Sorry.   Holy crap on a cracker.
Penny,"Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there."
Penny,"You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls."
Penny,"Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time."
Penny,Get rid of her how?
Penny,Excuse me?
Penny,"Okay, first of all, it is not man after man."
Penny,Hide you?
Penny,"Oh, man."
Penny,"Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it."
Penny,"Oh, gee, okay."
Penny,"Yeah, he’s a gift all right."
Penny,"Um, sure, sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker."
Penny,"Oh, hey, hi."
Penny,Sisters?
Penny,"I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static."
Penny,"You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America’s Next Top Model."
Penny,Fine.
Penny,"Oh. That’s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her."
Penny,They all live in a house together.
Penny,I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.
Penny,"Yeah, I guess."
Penny,To pay my cable bill.
Penny,"Oh, good, I hate her."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer.  What?"
Penny,It’s one onion ring.
Penny,I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?
Penny,"All right. Look, I didn’t know, I’m sorry."
Penny,What?
Penny,A sports metaphor?
Penny,"All right, yeah, I’ll play along. What was my first strike?"
Penny,I did?
Penny,"Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats."
Penny,"Come on, I touched one onion ring."
Penny,"Oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?"
Penny,"Well, what a thrill."
Penny,"Oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me."
Penny,I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.
Penny,"Ooh, strike three."
Penny,I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
Penny,"Yeah, you do that."
Penny,"Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up."
Penny,"Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,"Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don’t like your attitude."
Penny,"Yeah, no, there’s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Really? Well, that’s great."
Penny,What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
Penny,"Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him."
Penny,"Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do."
Penny,"That’s strike one, Leonard."
Penny,"There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
Penny,"Go ahead, eat it. I dare you"
Penny,Here. Try and go online.
Penny,"No, just try."
Penny,Well?
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt."
Penny,"I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds."
Penny,"Time to do your laundry, huh?"
Penny,"I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate."
Penny,"I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under, my ass."
Penny,"Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?"
Penny,"Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night."
Penny,"Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie."
Penny,Where are my clothes?
Penny,"Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone."
Penny,"Sheldon, where are my clothes?"
Penny,How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
Penny,Get them down.
Penny,Never.
Penny,"Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?"
Penny,"Look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here."
Penny,"Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it’s junior rodeo on."
Penny,"Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?"
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning."
Penny,What’s this?
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,"Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?"
Penny,"Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it."
Penny,"Good night, Sheldon."
Penny,Yes?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Understood.
Penny,"Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster."
Penny,"Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?"
Penny,"Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars."
Penny,"No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world."
Penny,"Okay, where is he going?"
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,New shirts?
Penny,Nice.
Penny,"So, who’s the girl?"
Penny,"Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
Penny,"Well, yeah, we did have a date."
Penny,"So, who is she?"
Penny,"Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?"
Penny,"Well, that depends."
Penny,Is that friend Wolowitz?
Penny,Screw him. You’re fine.
Penny,"Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you."
Penny,No.
Penny,I’m nosy. See ya.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,I’m sorry?
Penny,What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
Penny,Please don’t do that.
Penny,"So, this wasn’t the awkward part?"
Penny,"Oh, all right. S’u’up?"
Penny,"Okay, feeling the awkward now."
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard told me."
Penny,To you?
Penny,"Well, what about me?"
Penny,"Well, aren’t you sweet?"
Penny,"Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe."
Penny,Really?
Penny,I could think about you.
Penny,"Always nice talking to you, Sheldon."
Penny,What?
Penny,This is a door knob.
Penny,"Sheldon, would you like to come in?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
Penny,He’s having problems with Stephanie?
Penny,What?
Penny,We never got to the bedroom.
Penny,"Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Well, thank you."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,What?
Penny,Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
Penny,"Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold."
Penny,"Well, then who did?"
Penny,"Hi! Stephanie, right?"
Penny,"I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Nice to finally meet you, too."
Penny,"So, that’s Stephanie, huh?"
Penny,"You know, she seems very nice."
Penny,Roommate? You guys are living together?
Penny,Are you sure?
Penny,"Well, let’s find out."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!"
Penny,"Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?"
Penny,"Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?"
Penny,"You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box."
Penny,You have a Bat Signal?
Penny,Really? What was your first clue?
Penny,Oh hey.
Penny,"Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?"
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined."
Penny,Absolutely.
Penny,Are you guys having problems?
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something."
Penny,"Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers."
Penny,Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,"You’re kidding, right?"
Penny,Go! Wow.
Penny,"Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer."
Penny,Your pants are ruined.
Penny,"So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?"
Penny,"So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
Penny,"Good, good. And then what?"
Penny,"You had sex, didn’t you?"
Penny,"Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out."
Penny,"Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to."
Penny,"Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be."
Penny,"I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?"
Penny,"Yeah, that’ll slow it down."
Penny,Okay?
Penny,"Okay, let me check."
Penny,Hiney?
Penny,Saturnalia?
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree."
Penny,Uh-huh.
Penny,I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?
Penny,"Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present."
Penny,"Sheldon, I am very, very sorry."
Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?"
Penny,"My God, how fast were you going?"
Penny,Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?
Penny,"Oh, is it okay?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?"
Penny,"Ha-ha. No, you’re not."
Penny,"Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale."
Penny,"So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?"
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science."
Penny,"Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
Penny,"Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds."
Penny,"You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab."
Penny,Since always.
Penny,"Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket."
Penny,Okay. Let’s go.
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!"
Penny,I never said that.
Penny,"Oh, shut up!"
Penny,Really? We’re going to do an experiment?
Penny,It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
Penny,"Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?"
Penny,Why are you yelling at me?
Penny,Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.
Penny,Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
Penny,That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!
Penny,"And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?"
Penny,"Nice save, genius. Eggnog?"
Penny,It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
Penny,Smoother than you.
Penny,"Okay, Merry Christmas."
Penny,Merry Christmas.
Penny,How’s your leg?
Penny,"Okay, here."
Penny,Turn it over.
Penny,"Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin’s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it."
Penny,"Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it."
Penny,"Okay, all I’m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon."
Penny,Here. Open it.
Penny,"Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."
Penny,Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
Penny,Sheldon! What did you do?!
Penny,"Leonard, look! Sheldon’s hugging me."
Penny,"No, I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. "
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,What the hell?
Penny,"Yeah, well, it almost killed me."
Penny,"So, who exactly does it want to kill?"
Penny,"You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded."
Penny,How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?
Penny,"You’re a pig, Howard."
Penny,Our tango?
Penny,"Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you’re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon."
Penny,"Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy."
Penny,"I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever."
Penny,"Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone."
Penny,"Well, someone had to say it.  What?"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Yeah, come on in. What’s up?"
Penny,Get out.
Penny,"Well, then have the robot go and get him."
Penny,His feelings needed to be hurt.
Penny,"Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll."
Penny,"Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?"
Penny,What does that mean?
Penny,I turn into a bear?
Penny,"And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it."
Penny,"Oh, pthththth."
Penny,"Okay, come on, that’s not fair."
Penny,"Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow."
Penny,What about her?
Penny,"So, I just came by to see how you were doing."
Penny,Good. Your mom seems nice.
Penny,"Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I’m sorry. Howard."
Penny,"So, you’re okay?"
Penny,"Okay. Well, bye. "
Penny,"Aw, that sounds sweet."
Penny,"Oh, it’s cute."
Penny,That’s great.
Penny,"Oh, it’s fun."
Penny,"Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"
Penny,"Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space."
Penny,"Look, I’m telling you, I’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he’s a nice guy."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,I do. 
Penny,He slipped and fell.
Penny,"Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect."
Penny,"Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot."
Penny,"I know, I got it. Sheldon, I’m sorry."
Penny,Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
Penny,What’s up with Ichabod?
Penny,"Oh really? Well, good for him."
Penny,"Well, how did you guys become friends?"
Penny,And you moved in anyway?
Penny,"Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?"
Penny,"Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?"
Penny,"Oh come on, really? "
Penny,Hello Sheldon.
Penny,What is this?
Penny,"Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?"
Penny,"Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?"
Penny,Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
Penny,Thanks pal.
Penny,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?"
Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Penny,Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
Penny,Eww.
Penny,Penny.
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door."
Penny,Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
Penny,Is Leonard around?
Penny,"The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent."
Penny,It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
Penny,Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
Penny,"Yes, it occurs to me, too."
Penny,"Wow, you got a lot of money in there."
Penny,Don’t be silly.
Penny,"No, I can’t."
Penny,"Well, yeah, but…"
Penny,But what if you need it?
Penny,"Really? I mean, are you sure?"
Penny,Are they working on that?
Penny,"Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us."
Penny,I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
Penny,I’m regretting this already.
Penny,Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
Penny,No.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered."
Penny,"Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?"
Penny,"Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?"
Penny,"No, really, how much?"
Penny,"Well, which is it, ten or eleven?"
Penny,What?
Penny,What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
Penny,"‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody!  What was that about?"
Penny,"Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
Penny,"Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food."
Penny,"You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me."
Penny,"Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time."
Penny,She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
Penny,"Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills."
Penny,"Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience."
Penny,"I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over."
Penny,"Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it."
Penny,"Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem."
Penny,"Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way."
Penny,"Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star."
Penny,TV star.
Penny,"Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress."
Penny,That is not the definition of professional.
Penny,"Oh, that’s nothing."
Penny,"Well, remember Kurt?"
Penny,Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
Penny,He was drunk.
Penny,"Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines."
Penny,"No, but he will."
Penny,"Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money."
Penny,"I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Well, do you know anybody?"
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you."
Penny,And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
Penny,"Hey, is Sheldon here?"
Penny,Nice hat.
Penny,Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
Penny,"Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."
Penny,"Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
Penny,"Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys."
Penny,"Fellas, please."
Penny,You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
Penny,What’s that about?
Penny,It’s out of order.
Penny,I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
Penny,You must be Leonard’s mother.
Penny,"Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour."
Penny,"Oh, nice to meet you."
Penny,"Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment."
Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
Penny,"Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?"
Penny,"Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?"
Penny,"Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five."
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."
Penny,"Oh, well, I’m an actress."
Penny,What do you mean why?
Penny,"Yeah, I don’t know what that means."
Penny,"Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood."
Penny,"I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!"
Penny,"Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Your mom still here?
Penny,"Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
Penny,"Geez, what a fun couple."
Penny,"Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since."
Penny,"My head, what about yours?"
Penny,"She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."
Penny,"I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?"
Penny,"No, they said I was too perky."
Penny,"Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me."
Penny,A hugging machine?
Penny,"Oh, that is so sad."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, now this time…"
Penny,"You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime."
Penny,"Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime."
Penny,"Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush."
Penny,Why would you bring that up right now?
Penny,"So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?"
Penny,That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
Penny,Get out!
Penny,"Look, I was just coming over to talk to you."
Penny,Gotcha.
Penny,Would it help?
Penny,The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
Penny,How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
Penny,Are you planning on sitting here?
Penny,Then what difference does it make?
Penny,What?
Penny,Fine.   Happy?
Penny,"Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle."
Penny,"Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver."
Penny,"Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?"
Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. "
Penny,You think he’ll notice?
Penny,"Oh, what are we gonna do?"
Penny,Why do we have to tell him I did it?
Penny,"Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in."
Penny,"I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs."
Penny,"Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?"
Penny,"Oh, come on.  There, butt print."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair."
Penny,Here we go.
Penny,"Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,His right hand is calling him?
Penny,No. Not at all.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try."
Penny,"There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero."
Penny,Sit on the damn couch.
Penny,"What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?"
Penny,It’s exactly the same…
Penny,"You did make that up, right?"
Penny,Thanks for the shoes.
Penny,What the hell?
Penny,Screw that. 
Penny,"Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you."
Penny,"When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars."
Penny,"Oh, my God, the George Smoot?"
Penny,Of course I haven’t.
Penny,"It’s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot."
Penny,"Okay, now that I’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight."
Penny,"Oh, cool."
Penny,"Well, then why are you doing it?"
Penny,"Yeah, we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on.  Hello?"
Penny,Just a sec.  Hello?
Penny,Your dresser? Who is this?
Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?"
Penny,"Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what’s up?"
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?"
Penny,"Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call."
Penny,"Okay, I got a box, but there’s no key in here. Just letters."
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?"
Penny,"Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. How’s the train ride?"
Penny,"Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on."
Penny,"What up, Moon Pie?"
Penny,"Okay, I found the box. Now what?"
Penny,"Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?"
Penny,Not yet. There it is.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,I know. You’re safe.
Penny,"Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you."
Penny,What?
Penny,What is it?
Penny,"Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones."
Penny,"It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business."
Penny,"No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156."
Penny,"Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore."
Penny,Another waitress.
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
Penny,"Fine, cheeseburger."
Penny,"So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?"
Penny,About twenty.
Penny,"I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure."
Penny,That’s all?
Penny,"Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff."
Penny,And you know about that stuff?
Penny,Who’s Radiohead?
Penny,"Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?"
Penny,"Sheldon, wait! Will you?"
Penny,Yes.
Penny,I understand.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Oh, imagine that."
Penny,"No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!"
Penny,There. Done.
Penny,"Pretty good, right?"
Penny,A day?
Penny,That just can’t be right.
Penny,"No, sorry."
Penny,"Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it."
Penny,"Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending."
Penny,"All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?"
Penny,"Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes."
Penny,"Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s a bitch."
Penny,Ew.
Penny,I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
Penny,"Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?"
Penny,"Wait, wait, what am I going to do?"
Penny,"Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap."
Penny,"Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl."
Penny,We do?
Penny,No kidding. Two?
Penny,"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet."
Penny,How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
Penny,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?"
Penny,Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?"
Penny,"Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?"
Penny,"Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order."
Penny,I just don’t see how see can pull this off.
Penny,You guys get started.
Penny,Going online to buy shoes!
Penny,So?
Penny,Nicely done.
Penny,"Honey, do you want some coffee?"
Penny,"Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time."
Penny,"Leonard, help."
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,"Here, this will help."
Penny,We should have let him go to bed.
Penny,"I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I’m going to give you 20 cents."
Penny,Oh. Then never mind.
Penny,What?
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started."
Penny,Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
Penny,"Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who’s with me?"
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,We’re all out.
Penny,"Okay, it’s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
Penny,"Not with a thousand condoms, Howard."
Penny,"Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?"
Penny,The people upstairs are moving out.
Penny,How else was I supposed to say it?
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine."
Penny,"Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
Penny,"Well, I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet."
Penny,"You’re right, I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg."
Penny,"I tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it."
Penny,The horror!
Penny,Hi.
Penny,I can see.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging."
Penny,I can start.
Penny,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, be careful."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today, too."
Penny,"Well, sort of."
Penny,"I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?"
Penny,"Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?"
Penny,"Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical."
Penny,"Okay, now I see the giant squid head. "
Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift."
Penny,Great.
Penny,"Oh, this? I’m dressed like a slob today."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,That is so awesome.
Penny,"Yeah, I know, tell me about it."
Penny,"That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I’m holding out for the right part."
Penny,"Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”"
Penny,How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.
Penny,"Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago."
Penny,"Well, they’re all still up there."
Penny,"I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care."
Penny,"What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?"
Penny,Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
Penny,"No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes
Penny,"So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?"
Penny,"What can I say? I got my geek on, boys."
Penny,"Oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…"
Penny,…chinese food right here.
Penny,"I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?"
Penny,"Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn."
Penny,Please.
Penny,Oh boy.
Penny,"Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker."
Penny,"Um, I don’t know, I don’t think a lot."
Penny,"Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?"
Penny,"Well, you know, it’s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren’t like other guys. They’re special."
Penny,"Oh, let’s see, how can I explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields."
Penny,"Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them."
Penny,"Come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on."
Penny,Excuse me?
Penny,"Okay, lady, you are way out of line."
Penny,"Yeah, you’re out of line."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life."
Penny,"Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?"
Penny,"You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
Penny,"Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
Penny,"I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything."
Penny,Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,"Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid."
Penny,"Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me."
Penny,"Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?"
Penny,"Oh, great."
Penny,What’s a multiverse?
Penny,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
Penny,"No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah."
Penny,What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
Penny,Excuse me.
Penny,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
Penny,"Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?"
Penny,"Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?"
Penny,It’s really good.
Penny,"That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?"
Penny,"Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture."
Penny,"All right. So, um, just give me a call."
Penny,"Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight."
Penny,"It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?"
Penny,"Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun."
Penny,Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
Penny,"Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
Penny,"Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf."
Penny,"Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…"
Penny,I’ll just go look for it.
Penny,I found the decaf!
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
Penny,Great.
Penny,Really? Are you drunk?
Penny,"That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?"
Penny,"Mmm, what smells so good?"
Penny,"Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening."
Penny,"Have fun, Sheldon."
Penny,"What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?"
Penny,"Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere."
Penny,"So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place."
Penny,Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
Penny,In your apartment.
Penny,"Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there."
Penny,"It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk."
Penny,"Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting."
Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
Penny,"Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to."
Penny,"Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…"
Penny,"Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?"
Penny,"Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Where did that even come from, did he say we were?"
Penny,"No, just mail, no benefits."
Penny,Why are you asking?
Penny,"Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship."
Penny,Excuse me?
Penny,"Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with you."
Penny,"Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?"
Penny,"I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!"
Penny,"I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here."
Penny,"Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."
Penny,Only if it doesn’t rhyme.
Penny,What?
Penny,Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
Penny,Your home is twenty feet from here.
Penny,Damn it. What do you want me to do
Penny,That’s only for when you’re sick.
Penny,"Come on, do I really have to?"
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…"
Penny,Sleepy ki…
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Oh, you’re welcome sweetie."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
Penny,How’s it going?
Penny,"Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?"
Penny,You know your friend Stuart?
Penny,"Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first."
Penny,"Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…"
Penny,"Okay, well, that’s really cool of you."
Penny,"Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?"
Penny,"He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?"
Penny,Really?
Penny,Morning. What’s up?
Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee."
Penny,I really don’t want to talk about it.
Penny,I said I don’t want to talk about it.
Penny,"Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?"
Penny,What’s classified?
Penny,"Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?"
Penny,"Yeah, I said Leonard."
Penny,What the hell is that?
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny,What do you want?
Penny,"Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."
Penny,What?
Penny,You’re all going?
Penny,For three months?
Penny,Excuse me.
Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
Penny,Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
Penny,Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
Penny,"Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised."
Penny,Is he serious?
Penny,"All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome."
Penny,"Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside."
Penny,"Well, I got you a little going away present."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff."
Penny,"Oh, I’m gonna miss you.  See you later."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, what time is it?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Um, I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice."
Penny,"Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination."
Penny,That wasn’t a long hug.
Penny,"Leonard, I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Okay, have a safe trip."
Penny,"Okay, bye.  Means I wish you weren’t going."
Penny,"Leonard, you’re back."
Penny,Hi! 
Penny,I missed you so much.
Penny,I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
Penny,"Oh, this is ridiculous. What?"
Penny,It’s great to see you too. Come on in.
Penny,"Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?"
Penny,Is that true?
Penny,Why did you have to make him happy?
Penny,"Oh, the poor thing."
Penny,"Wait, wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?"
Penny,"No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will."
Penny,Hey. Do you want to talk?
Penny,"Oh, hon… Uh…   Soft kitty, warm kitty…"
Penny,Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song.
Penny,"Well, you know, I do understand what you’re going through."
Penny,"Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag."
Penny,"Well, they’re pretty tasty."
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?"
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?"
Penny,Are you serious?
Penny,"Oh, my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand."
Penny,"So, how do you know he ran away?"
Penny,"Well, Leonard, aren’t you going to do something?"
Penny,"Well, you’re not gonna go with them?"
Penny,"Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend."
Penny,No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
Penny,Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
Penny,Go.
Penny,Uh-huh.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,It’s weird.
Penny,What are they talking about?
Penny,"Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
Penny,"Ugh, I am so embarrassed!"
Penny,What did you tell them?
Penny,Fine? You said it was fine?
Penny,It was… okay.
Penny,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes."
Penny,No.
Penny,"You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?"
Penny,"Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off."
Penny,"Don’t talk, just drink."
Penny,Hit me.
Penny,Peppermint schnapps.
Penny,"Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?"
Penny,Schnapps.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?"
Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?"
Penny,What do you have a safe deposit box for?
Penny,"What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular."
Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either."
Penny,"I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard."
Penny,What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
Penny,"Okay, forget the chicken."
Penny,"No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard."
Penny,"No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends."
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
Penny,"I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."
Penny,It would take the pressure off.
Penny,"So, we’ll just be friends."
Penny,Come here. 
Penny,"Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,Are you fun in any of them?
Penny,"All right, want some French toast?"
Penny,"Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal."
Penny,A homunculus?
Penny,"Oh, you’re my little homunculus."
Penny,"Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
Penny,"Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass."
Penny,"You know what, I give up. He’s impossible."
Penny,"Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim."
Penny,I know. What are the odds?
Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you."
Penny,"Fine, whatever. Are you finished?"
Penny,"Um, yeah, sure, thanks."
Penny,"Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?"
Penny,"Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass."
Penny,"They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,What’s this cartoon called again?
Penny,"Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three."
Penny,"Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip."
Penny,Yes please.  You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Of course.
Penny,"Mmm, these are so good"
Penny,What?
Penny,"well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place."
Penny,"Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."
Penny,You’re boring people sweetie.
Penny,"So, what are you guys doing?"
Penny,Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
Penny,"Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial."
Penny,"Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
Penny,I guess I could serve both.
Penny,Tur-briska-fil?
Penny,"Raj, what about you?"
Penny,"Hard to believe, but go on."
Penny,"Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
Penny,"Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?"
Penny,"Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?"
Penny,Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
Penny,"Yes, we know."
Penny,"Hey, I happen to love this movie."
Penny,"Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex."
Penny,"Oh, kill me."
Penny,"See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that."
Penny,Do something.
Penny,That’s great.
Penny,Are we terrible people?
Penny,"Get him, bring him back."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Um, I have a question."
Penny,"Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?"
Penny,Which one?
Penny,How could he ruin the game?
Penny,"Sheldon, that is incredible."
Penny,"Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go."
Penny,"Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka."
Penny,Ba-eye.
Penny,"Wow, you really are a genius."
Penny,"You mean, like a pinky swear?"
Penny,"Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?"
Penny,Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
Penny,"The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard."
Penny,"Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."
Penny,And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
Penny,I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
Penny,The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
Penny,"Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave."
Penny,"She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her."
Penny,"No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
Penny,"I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…"
Penny,"Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother."
Penny,I’m kidding.
Penny,"Yeah, well, it’s your fault."
Penny,What?
Penny,Am I a matchmaker or what?
Penny,"Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?"
Penny,Kite fighting?
Penny,"Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game."
Penny,"I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan."
Penny,"Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone."
Penny,See ya.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,It was pretty good. We won.
Penny,I’m glad to hear it.
Penny,"Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?"
Penny,Sure you have.
Penny,Of course not.
Penny,"Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored."
Penny,"Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists."
Penny,Like who?
Penny,"Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us."
Penny,They have them every week.
Penny,You wanted to meet my friends.
Penny,"Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen."
Penny,"Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
Penny,How much beer have you had?
Penny,Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
Penny,"Here, have some pizza, sweetie."
Penny,I know. I just need you stop talking.
Penny,"Sheldon, come in."
Penny,There’s some in the fridge.
Penny,"On Earth, we say thank you."
Penny,"You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon."
Penny,Until half time.
Penny,And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
Penny,No.
Penny,"So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart."
Penny,"Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game."
Penny,"All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed."
Penny,Yay.
Penny,"Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport."
Penny,"Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
Penny,"My friend, Justin."
Penny,I told you about him.
Penny,"Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."
Penny,He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.
Penny,"Well, he’s definitely not gay."
Penny,"Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out."
Penny,Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
Penny,You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot.
Penny,"How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!"
Penny,"Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!"
Penny,"Oh, now I’m a child? Well, at least I’m not an idiot anymore!"
Penny,"Oh, you are such a…  What the hell is he doing?"
Penny,"Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Not really, no."
Penny,Are you ready to apologize?
Penny,"E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
Penny,"Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!"
Penny,"Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
Penny,"Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Penny,Is Leonard coming?
Penny,"Well, that’s not gonna happen."
Penny,Which is?
Penny,I’m busy.
Penny,Fine. What do you want?
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
Penny,"Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?"
Penny,Great.
Penny,Don’t you usually get lemonade?
Penny,Do you want lemonade?
Penny,Anything else?
Penny,I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
Penny,"Well, I’m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go."
Penny,Leonard is wrong.
Penny,"I’m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I’ve committed?"
Penny,"Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?"
Penny,My singing?
Penny,"Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?"
Penny,"Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!"
Penny,"I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
Penny,"It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?"
Penny,"That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!"
Penny,"Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
Penny,"No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
Penny,"Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!"
Penny,"Really? Why not? You’re so smart, and I’m so dumb!"
Penny,"Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?"
Penny,What stop sign?
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,What do you mean?
Penny,"Oh, yeah, kind of. It’s, it’s no big thing."
Penny,"All right, what’s going on?"
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go home. Look, we’re done fighting."
Penny,"Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting."
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you let this go?!"
Penny,"Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let’s just… Sheldon, please,"
Penny,"You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?"
Penny,"Okay, you can have that one."
Penny,"Buy him the robot, Leonard."
Penny,"Yes, you can."
Penny,"He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
Penny,Come in! Hurry!
Penny,I’m back here.
Penny,"Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!"
Penny,Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock.
Penny,"I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder."
Penny,What?
Penny,I know. I slipped.
Penny,"Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?"
Penny,What?
Penny,Uh-huh.
Penny,"Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room."
Penny,"Okay, can you drive me?"
Penny,"Well, I can’t drive!"
Penny,Ow.
Penny,"No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."
Penny,No one’s saying that. Let’s go.
Penny,"I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt."
Penny,One was already in an accident.
Penny,"Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!"
Penny,Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
Penny,"No… No… Oh, that’s cute."
Penny,"Okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
Penny,But don’t look.
Penny,I don’t want you to see me naked.
Penny,"Yeah, great."
Penny,"Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve."
Penny,Is that my arm?
Penny,"Then, maybe you should let it go."
Penny,"You have your learner’s permit, right?"
Penny,Good.
Penny,"All right, can we please go?"
Penny,It’s right there.
Penny,"In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?"
Penny,Could you please drive a little faster?
Penny,Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
Penny,No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
Penny,"It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock."
Penny,"Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm."
Penny,What?
Penny,"It’s not soup, it’s courage."
Penny,How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look.
Penny,I dislocated my shoulder.
Penny,You ready know that.
Penny,No.
Penny,No.
Penny,Getting one.
Penny,No.
Penny,Change migraine to yes.
Penny,"Oh, next question."
Penny,"Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
Penny,Ass.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?"
Penny,Thanks. That’s much better.
Penny,Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that.
Penny,"You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
Penny,Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
Penny,Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
Penny,"Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty…  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Penny,Why are you back from your date so early?
Penny,What exactly does that mean?
Penny,"Hi, guys."
Penny,"Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?"
Penny,"Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?"
Penny,She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
Penny,Different how?
Penny,Are you high?
Penny,"Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
Penny,"Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically."
Penny,"My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath."
Penny,"All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
Penny,"Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you."
Penny,"Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya."
Penny,Wow.
Penny,"Hey, here’s your tip from table seven."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,You want me to throw him out?
Penny,"Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
Penny,"Oh, I am so sorry."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, check this out. "
Penny,You want me to put it back?
Penny,"Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there."
Penny,"Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?"
Penny,Shoes for Less.
Penny,"Oh, great selection, great prices."
Penny,Womenfolk?
Penny,Just eat your dinner.
Penny,"Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny."
Penny,"Howard, never let her go."
Penny,It’s not about shoes.
Penny,"Um, actually, can we do it in private?"
Penny,"Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?"
Penny,"Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does."
Penny,‘Cause I want to surprise him.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me."
Penny,You’re sitting here playing video games all day.
Penny,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
Penny,"Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer."
Penny,"Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment."
Penny,"Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,Ready to get started?
Penny,"Um, I don’t have one."
Penny,I have to take notes?
Penny,There’s gonna be a test?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Ancient Greece?
Penny,"Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?"
Penny,Twenty six hundred years?
Penny,I have to go to the bathroom.
Penny,Not for twenty six hundred years.
Penny,"Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?"
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!
Penny,"No, you just suck at teaching."
Penny,"Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?"
Penny,Not that far back!
Penny,I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
Penny,Damn it!
Penny,Squared?
Penny,Aristotle?
Penny,Five?
Penny,Then I don’t know.
Penny,Because I’m stupid!
Penny,"Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?"
Penny,"Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
Penny,"Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?"
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, balls."
Penny,"Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist."
Penny,"Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes."
Penny,"You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?"
Penny,I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
Penny,Really? Why not?
Penny,"Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?"
Penny,"Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?"
Penny,So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
Penny,What is it?
Penny,"Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy."
Penny,"No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane."
Penny,What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
Penny,When were you going to tell me?
Penny,Why were you keeping this a secret?
Penny,Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
Penny,"Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on."
Penny,So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
Penny,"You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?"
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no."
Penny,"No, it sounded like a compliment."
Penny,Nothing. Not a damn thing.
Penny,"Oh, it’s not a problem."
Penny,"No, you do not."
Penny,"Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
Penny,"Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?"
Penny,"Sure, sure."
Penny,Eight years?
Penny,Yikes. What’s so funny?
Penny,You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
Penny,"I do, I’ll teach you."
Penny,"Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
Penny,I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
Penny,"As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine."
Penny,"Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again."
Penny,"Hey, Bev, guess what?"
Penny,I’m sleeping with your son.
Penny,The one from whom I live across the hall from.
Penny,"Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis."
Penny,"Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
Penny,"Well, let’s go find out who."
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
Penny,You’re in trouble.
Penny,"Yeah, not bad, not bad."
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Penny,What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
Penny,That’s the Del Taco.
Penny,"I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny."
Penny,Agreed.
Penny,"Oh, thank you, Beverly."
Penny,That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
Penny,"Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon."
Penny,"Well, promise you won’t make fun of me."
Penny,"Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial."
Penny,"She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site."
Penny,Why are you being such a jerk?
Penny,"Ha-ha, bite me."
Penny,"Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
Penny,"Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact."
Penny,"Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me."
Penny,Amazing. Would you like to try some?
Penny,"Well, the fact is, you can’t."
Penny,Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
Penny,"Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?"
Penny,Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
Penny,I would not.
Penny,Really?
Penny,You saying I don’t have an open mind?
Penny,"You know, I believe in ghosts, too."
Penny,And astrology.
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work."
Penny,"Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo."
Penny,"I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run"
Penny,I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
Penny,"It won’t happen again, what’s up?"
Penny,"Good night. That was weird, even for him."
Penny,Who is it?
Penny,Yes?
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
Penny,"Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?"
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep."
Penny,"Wait, wait, what’s 0400?"
Penny,"That’s, like, in 45 minutes."
Penny,"Oh, my…"
Penny,"He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard."
Penny,"No, thanks."
Penny,"Ugh, what can you do? Here. "
Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
Penny,Is he quitting his job at the university?
Penny,Born and raised. 
Penny,"Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you."
Penny,"Sheldon, that’s so… "
Penny,Whatcha doing?
Penny,Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
Penny,Yes.
Penny,And you’re stuck?
Penny,"Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee."
Penny,What is he doing now?
Penny,Not recently.
Penny,"For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them."
Penny,Shh.
Penny,"Oh, poor baby."
Penny,"Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. "
Penny,"Oh, damn."
Penny,Do I look okay?
Penny,"Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it."
Penny,Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
Penny,"Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep."
Penny,"Well, it creeps me out."
Penny,Just answer the phone.
Penny,What happened?
Penny,Okay. Have fun.
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
Penny,"Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up."
Penny,Leonard doesn’t snore.
Penny,"Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you."
Penny,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
Penny,"No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?"
Penny,"You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
Penny,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
Penny,"Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy."
Penny,"Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?"
Penny,Sheldon doesn’t work here.
Penny,"Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?"
Penny,"Okay, what’s the big surprise?"
Penny,"Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
Penny,"Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here."
Penny,We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
Penny,We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it."
Penny,We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
Penny,"Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!"
Penny,My Rabe-what-ly?
Penny,You actually put that in an agreement?
Penny,Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
Penny,"Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?"
Penny,"It’s not over, is it?"
Penny,Hello.
Penny,"Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
Penny,Better acoustics for your throat singing?
Penny,"Oh, for God’s sakes."
Penny,I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
Penny,"Okay, show’s over."
Penny,"Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go."
Penny,I’ll talk to Leonard.
Penny,"Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go."
Penny,You’re welcome.
Penny,I think we’re there.
Penny,I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
Penny,"Think it through, Leonard."
Penny,Oh!
Penny,"No, no, it’s probably just allergies."
Penny,Do any of them work?
Penny,Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
Penny,I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
Penny,Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
Penny,Here’s your soup.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
Penny,"Yeah, well, I’m sick, too."
Penny,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon."
Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
Penny,Hi!
Penny,"Um, can you give me a hint?"
Penny,"Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?"
Penny,"Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!"
Penny,Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
Penny,"Um, he was on Star Trek."
Penny,Star Wars?
Penny,"Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?"
Penny,"Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?"
Penny,I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
Penny,"No, it isn’t."
Penny,"No, it isn’t."
Penny,"Mmm, no, it isn’t."
Penny,"Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?"
Penny,No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
Penny,"Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series."
Penny,"Oh, balls."
Penny,"All right, let’s go."
Penny,What is this?
Penny,Do I have a choice?
Penny,"The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
Penny,"Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you."
Penny,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
Penny,Sheldon’s in jail.
Penny,"What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes."
Penny,"Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail."
Penny,We’re home.
Penny,"I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
Penny,"Okay, I realize that…"
Penny,"Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…"
Penny,Did he just somehow give me the finger?
Penny,"Hey, Stuart."
Penny,What’s going on?
Penny,Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
Penny,"Oh, nice."
Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
Penny,"Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet."
Penny,Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
Penny,Really? Great!
Penny,Then why did you tell me you had it?
Penny,"I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway."
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,What kind of deal?
Penny,You’re extorting a date out of me?
Penny,Can I bring Leonard?
Penny,Deal.
Penny,Yup.
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…"
Penny,Are you Stan Lee?
Penny,"Hi. I’m Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon."
Penny,"Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I said I’m inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee’s house."
Penny,I’m sorry. He doesn’t really understand sarcasm.
Penny,Nice to meet you.
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?"
Penny,"Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down."
Penny,Who’s Adam West?
Penny,There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
Penny,That is so sad.
Penny,"Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
Penny,What ring?
Penny,Why?
Penny,"Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?"
Penny,Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
Penny,Whatcha doin’?
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me."
Penny,"FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret."
Penny,"Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."
Penny,"Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court."
Penny,I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,Just sit.
Penny,"Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together."
Penny,"Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself."
Penny,Did I see X-Men?
Penny,"Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?"
Penny,"Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence."
Penny,"So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?"
Penny,"It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice."
Penny,"Yeah, so?"
Penny,Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.
Penny,"No, you’re wrong."
Penny,Where the hell d’you find that?
Penny,It’s ridiculous.
Penny,Please just try this one on.
Penny,What’s the matter?
Penny,"Here, drink this. It’ll relax you."
Penny,"Fine, faint."
Penny,"Here, see if this one works."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
Penny,Do or do not. There is no try.
Penny,I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
Penny,Oh. Oh. Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad."
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Hmm.
Penny,"Okay, good night, sweetie."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, right, bowling."
Penny,"No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me."
Penny,"It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon."
Penny,Thinly veiled contempt.
Penny,Got it.
Penny,Bite me!
Penny,Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
Penny,"Yeah, why?"
Penny,Do you really want to get into this right now?
Penny,"Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say."
Penny,I’m not sure.
Penny,"Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
Penny,"Don’t push it, Leonard."
Penny,You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!
Penny,What?
Penny,Ice cream?
Penny,"Um, Ach."
Penny,Did Leonard send you over here?
Penny,"Yeah, I’m sorry about that."
Penny,"Again, I’m sorry."
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
Penny,"Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now."
Penny,"No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you."
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,"You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?"
Penny,I think we should talk now.
Penny,"Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
Penny,"Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well."
Penny,"I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though."
Penny,"So, we’re good?"
Penny,The Wesley Crushers?
Penny,I don’t get it.
Penny,Still don’t get it.
Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher."
Penny,"Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know."
Penny,"Hey, thanks."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Yeah, that’s right."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, me, too."
Penny,Tell me about it.
Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry."
Penny,Really?
Penny,What are you talking about?
Penny,No!
Penny,"Yeah, I got it."
Penny,I know.
Penny,"Leonard, stop pressuring me."
Penny,"Yeah, you are! Just back off!"
Penny,I didn’t mean shut up.
Penny,"No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry."
Penny,"Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?"
Penny,"God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?"
Penny,"Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus."
Penny,Really?
Penny,Right.
Penny,Everyone.
Penny,Great.
Penny,"So, how you been?"
Penny,"You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?"
Penny,Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?
Penny,I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.
Penny,Yep.
Penny,Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
Penny,"Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?"
Penny,I don’t have hot dogs.
Penny,"So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?"
Penny,"Well, good."
Penny,He’s been crying?
Penny,"Oh, God, I feel terrible."
Penny,"No. Why, do you?"
Penny,"Why did you ask if I had one, too?"
Penny,"All right. So, what’s new in your life?"
Penny,Have you been running?
Penny,I’m so glad you like it.
Penny,"Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook."
Penny,"Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge."
Penny,"Oh, um, I, I can come back."
Penny,"Yeah, I guess you’re right."
Penny,Nope.
Penny,"Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me."
Penny,"Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels."
Penny,"Oh, well, then you, you do it."
Penny,"Okay, you can take him for shoes."
Penny,"Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come."
Penny,"Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?"
Penny,We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.
Penny,"Okay, whatever."
Penny,"All right, got it. Is there anything else?"
Penny,What’s the problem with Goofy?
Penny,We’re home.
Penny,How was I supposed to know that?
Penny,"I know, I know."
Penny,"No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth."
Penny,Just go.
Penny,"You’re welcome, sweetie."
Penny,"Oh, um, I should probably get going."
Penny,"Yep, okay."
Penny,Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
Penny,He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
Penny,I think we can do it.
Penny,"No, be friends. You and me."
Penny,Good. I’m glad.
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,"What? What are you doing with, what?"
Penny,"Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?"
Penny,Oh. What?
Penny,"Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?"
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled."
Penny,Female jibber jabber?
Penny,"Oh, they’re not my friends."
Penny,"Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work."
Penny,"No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light."
Penny,Hello.
Penny,"Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
Penny,"Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?"
Penny,Good.
Penny,Hang on.
Penny,We just broke up.
Penny,Not as good as you apparently.
Penny,"You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
Penny,I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
Penny,You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
Penny,"Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard?"
Penny,I found these in the dryer. I’m assuming they belong to Sheldon.
Penny,You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
Penny,"Well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
Penny,"No, you don’t."
Penny,"Oh, I’m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation."
Penny,I’m listening.
Penny,"Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet."
Penny,Hang on.
Penny,"Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
Penny,"Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
Penny,"Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
Penny,"Oh, I do not believe that."
Penny,So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
Penny,"Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon."
Penny,"Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
Penny,Why on earth did you agree to all that?
Penny,"Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you."
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,"A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?"
Penny,Why not?
Penny,What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
Penny,"So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in."
Penny,"Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
Penny,"Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room."
Penny,Fine. Go ahead. 
Penny,"So, why was it his lucky day?"
Penny,What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
Penny,Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
Penny,"Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
Penny,"Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. "
Penny,"Oh, hi. What’s going on?"
Penny,"I’m sorry, what?"
Penny,Um…
Penny,"Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard."
Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
Penny,"Oh, but what about the party?"
Penny,"Oh, right."
Penny,"Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack."
Penny,Oh! That’s very cool.
Penny,Sheldon! Play nice.
Penny,"Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun."
Penny,"No, just keep walking."
Penny,"Damn you, you rat bastard."
Penny,"Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"
Penny,"‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid."
Penny,"Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
Penny,He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
Penny,"You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me."
Penny,We’re gonna have sex.
Penny,"Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud."
Penny,"What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?"
Penny,"Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry."
Penny,"Yeah, sorry about that."
Penny,"Oh, God."
Penny,"Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift."
Penny,"Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
Penny,"Leonard, last night was a mistake."
Penny,"Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?"
Penny,"Oh, God!"
Penny,"Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?"
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Leonard."
Penny,Are you drunk?
Penny,Are you out of your mind?!
Penny,"Ah, cool."
Penny,"Oh, does that come up much on the space station?"
Penny,All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Penny,"Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry."
Penny,Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
Penny,"Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing."
Penny,Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
Penny,You stole it?
Penny,Who’s Amy?
Penny,Sheldon has a girlfriend?
Penny,How long has this been going on?
Penny,"Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?"
Penny,"Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?"
Penny,"Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy."
Penny,"Okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
Penny,"Okay, I have a question."
Penny,You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
Penny,"Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?"
Penny,"Oh, God."
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child."
Penny,Probably not.
Penny,You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
Penny,"Yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time."
Penny,What do you want?
Penny,"Oh, that’s great. Have fun."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Well, go ask Leonard."
Penny,Leonard said cockamamie?
Penny,"Okay, fine. When’s the date?"
Penny,Now?
Penny,"Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?"
Penny,"Well, no, not per se, but…"
Penny,Let me get my cockamamie keys.
Penny,You’re welcome.
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,Can I ask you a question?
Penny,"Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know."
Penny,"My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
Penny,Fair point.
Penny,"So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s okay."
Penny,"Um, what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great."
Penny,"Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice."
Penny,"No, no, I was just giving you a compliment."
Penny,"Guys, how ’bout some music?"
Penny,"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?"
Penny,"Well, why don’t you tell her?"
Penny,"Any follow up, Amy?"
Penny,"I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs."
Penny,I don’t know. I was just trying something.
Penny,"Hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?"
Penny,"No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss."
Penny,"So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few. "
Penny,What? Where did you get 171 men?
Penny,"Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15."
Penny,14
Penny,No.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point."
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here."
Penny,"No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?"
Penny,I did not have sex with 31 guys.
Penny,And that is?
Penny,You’re still on that?
Penny,"Okay, you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I’m gonna tell your mother on you."
Penny,Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
Penny,"If I’d thought of that in the first place, I could’ve saved myself this whole night."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, you wanted me to pay."
Penny,"No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?"
Penny,"Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash."
Penny,Nothing.
Penny,I’m cute. I get by.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
Penny,For what?
Penny,"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
Penny,"Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?"
Penny,So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
Penny,"Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?"
Penny,"Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?"
Penny,"No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, that is so creepy!"
Penny,"Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees."
Penny,Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
Penny,I don’t have one.
Penny,Don’t have one.
Penny,"Uh, no."
Penny,"No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw."
Penny,It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
Penny,"All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it."
Penny,"Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?"
Penny,"Okay, let’s just warm up on the run."
Penny,"Okay, let’s go."
Penny,"Oh, let me help you up."
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon!"
Penny,Thanks.
Penny,"Hey, what’s my share?"
Penny,"Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?"
Penny,What am I up to now?
Penny,"It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back.  Shut up!"
Penny,"Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference."
Penny,"So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks."
Penny,"Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress."
Penny,I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you."
Penny,Because you’re not here.
Penny,"Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars."
Penny,"You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime."
Penny,"What up, Shel-Bot?"
Penny,What do you want me to do?
Penny,"Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?"
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur."
Penny,"Happy kitty, sleepy…"
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Penny,"Hey, look, it’s Shamy."
Penny,All righty. What’s new?
Penny,"I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?"
Penny,"Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here."
Penny,"So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?"
Penny,Get one yourself.
Penny,"God, he’s an ass when he drinks."
Penny,I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
Penny,"Well, what’d he say?"
Penny,"Kinda, sorta had to?"
Penny,"Well, you defended me, right?"
Penny,What?
Penny,No.
Penny,No!
Penny,"Wow, that is better."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,I hear you broke up with Amy.
Penny,"Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?"
Penny,Amy.
Penny,"Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough."
Penny,Okay. Good.
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,"Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
Penny,You want the fruit platter?
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift."
Penny,Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
Penny,"Oh, absolutely."
Penny,"Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?"
Penny,"Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out."
Penny,"Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?"
Penny,"Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill."
Penny,"Um, the online game? Sure."
Penny,"Oh, God. I think I see where this is going."
Penny,"Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing."
Penny,Bernadette or the troll?
Penny,"Well, what was your side?"
Penny,Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
Penny,"Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this."
Penny,"Okay, I will think about it."
Penny,"Yeah, I said I’d think about it."
Penny,"Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?"
Penny,"Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?"
Penny,Are you gonna want to order food?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
Penny,Oh. I’m sorry.
Penny,"You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea."
Penny,"It’s passion fruit, new on the menu."
Penny,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?"
Penny,Not where I can hear you guys.
Penny,"Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while."
Penny,Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
Penny,"Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready."
Penny,Sheldon?
Penny,What are you doing here?
Penny,"You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden."
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?"
Penny,Could you be a little more specific?
Penny,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres."
Penny,"Great.  Now, where were we?"
Penny,A what?
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don’t you give it a try."
Penny,"All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?"
Penny,"Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey."
Penny,I drink.
Penny,"You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend."
Penny,Exactly. Sometimes you can’t win.
Penny,Kirk cheated.
Penny,Right there with you.
Penny,What?
Penny,"What? Sheldon, you can’t reprogram people."
Penny,How long?
Penny,"Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?"
Penny,"And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love."
Penny,"You know, I could totally rock a hat like that."
Penny,"Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?"
Penny,"What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!"
Penny,"Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds."
Penny,"Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t."
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,"Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys."
Penny,"Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that."
Penny,"Uh, just wear something comfortable."
Penny,"You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front"
Penny,So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
Penny,"All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two."
Penny,That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
Penny,"Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party."
Penny,Not even when you were a kid?
Penny,"Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!"
Penny,Howard has a hairy chest?
Penny,"Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?"
Penny,"And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call."
Penny,"Okay, it’s your game. You go first."
Penny,"Wait. No, Amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing."
Penny,What the hell was that?
Penny,Truth.
Penny,Dare.
Penny,"Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a great guy."
Penny,"I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready for it."
Penny,You can only ask one question.
Penny,"You know what, I don’t want to play anymore."
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I’m sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?"
Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad."
Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later.  Bye."
Penny,So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
Penny,"Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again."
Penny,"Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby."
Penny,"Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running."
Penny,"Okay, why are you arguing about this?"
Penny,"Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?"
Penny,"Come on, honey, not in front of my dad."
Penny,"Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?"
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"So not funny, dad."
Penny,"Oh, will you please let it go?"
Penny,"Oh, see?"
Penny,"Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on."
Penny,"Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking."
Penny,"Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."
Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning."
Penny,"No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important."
Penny,Good night.
Penny,"Love you, too."
Penny,Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
Penny,Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
Penny,Why are you making this so difficult?
Penny,Leonard.
Penny,No.
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,Maybe.
Penny,"Oh, my God. What personal habits?"
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…"
Penny,"No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?"
Penny,"I’m sorry, daddy…"
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"You know, I’m sorry."
Penny,"You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth."
Penny,"Daddy, he had nothing to do…"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"I love your little heart locket, Bernadette."
Penny,"Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool."
Penny,"Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?"
Penny,"Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy."
Penny,"Yeah, you, too."
Penny,"Oh, we went out a couple of times."
Penny,"No, no. But in this case, yes."
Penny,"No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level."
Penny,Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
Penny,"Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?"
Penny,Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
Penny,That’s thinking ahead.
Penny,So how’s Amy?
Penny,"Oh, no. Why?"
Penny,Just going to skip over that insult.
Penny,"Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the"
Penny,Oh! Okay. Wow.
Penny,Are you sure?
Penny,I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
Penny,Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
Penny,Exactly.
Penny,"Oh, Amy, you lucky girl."
Penny,"Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again."
Penny,"Okay, we should, we should go."
Penny,"You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. "
Penny,What?
Penny,No.
Penny,"Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?"
Penny,I’m not happy.
Penny,I’m still mad at you.
Penny,What great news?
Penny,"Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?"
Penny,"Okay, what about your friend Amy?"
Penny,"Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume."
Penny,All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
Penny,No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
Penny,Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
Penny,Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
Penny,I’m not talking to you.
Penny,What the hell is wrong with you?
Penny,"Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?"
Penny,Really?
Penny,"No. Wait, wait, does it?"
Penny,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Penny,"Go away, Sheldon."
Penny,"Oh. Go away, Leonard."
Penny,It’s open.
Penny,"I’m not going to that party, Leonard."
Penny,It’s not the wig.
Penny,"Okay, look. We’re not really me and him."
Penny,I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
Penny,You make a cute Green Arrow.
Penny,Like there’s a difference.
Penny,"Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you."
Penny,Nothing. Let’s go to the party.  How do I look?
Penny,Are you high?
Penny,"Who, me?"
Penny,What idea?
Penny,"Okay, stop, stop!"
Penny,"Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested."
Penny,Bored.
Penny,"Hey, wait a minute."
Penny,Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
Penny,"Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this."
Penny,What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Something got you down, there, Sheldon?"
Penny,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry."
Penny,Is that so?
Penny,Aw.
Penny,"Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me."
Penny,"Seriously, I have a great idea for one."
Penny,"Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them."
Penny,"Well, you don’t like it?"
Penny,Why not?
Penny,And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?"
Penny,Milk.
Penny,That’s what it says on the packet.
Penny,"No, sorry."
Penny,What does that mean?
Penny,"Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back."
Penny,"Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it."
Penny,"Look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?"
Penny,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
Penny,Okay. Wait right here.
Penny,"Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you."
Penny,That’s right.
Penny,"No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this."
Penny,Say you’re sorry.
Penny,"Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?"
Penny,No?
Penny,"Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically."
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go."
Penny,"Oh, you’re welcome."
Penny,"Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks."
Penny,"Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy."
Penny,"Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…"
Penny,Hey. So you guys ready to order?
Penny,"Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger."
Penny,"Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend."
Penny,The what?
Penny,"Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so."
Penny,I’m your best friend?
Penny,"Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him."
Penny,"No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?"
Penny,"Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?"
Penny,"You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie."
Penny,"I, I wasn’t going to."
Penny,"Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages."
Penny,"You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat."
Penny,Yay!
Penny,Brawny?
Penny,"So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Oh. Thanks.
Penny,Terrific. Are we there yet?
Penny,"Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?"
Penny,"Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?"
Penny,Who elected you Road Trip God?
Penny,I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
Penny,I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
Penny,Should I ask?
Penny,"Red Leader, I’m really sorry."
Penny,"You know what? I missed you, too."
Penny,Will do.
Penny,"Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?"
Penny,"Um, I never really thought about it. Why?"
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Again, I’ve never given it much thought."
Penny,"Yeah. Why, what happened?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, that. Come on in."
Penny,We are?
Penny,"Oh, right, right, the blog."
Penny,"Hey, can I stay here tonight?"
Penny,"Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites."
Penny,Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Well, I’m not getting in bed with him."
Penny,We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
Penny,Sleep.
Penny,The what?
Penny,"Oh, okay. Just like old times."
Penny,"Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up."
Penny,Go to sleep.
Penny,We are not having coitus.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Leonard, are you asleep?"
Penny,I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
Penny,I know it’s kinda weird.
Penny,True dat?
Penny,Right. Still mad at me about that?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Good for you.
Penny,"Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!"
Penny,"Oh, shut up, Sheldon!"
Penny,"Yeah, hi."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on."
Penny,Thanks. What are you guys doing?
Penny,Oh. How’d he do?
Penny,"That bad, huh?"
Penny,Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
Penny,"Oh, please let me tell him."
Penny,What?
Penny,I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.
Penny,You want an acting lesson?
Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
Penny,"Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge."
Penny,"Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t."
Penny,I think it’s the only way to look at it.
Penny,Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
Penny,Forget it.
Penny,"Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash."
Penny,What’s wrong?
Penny,You were acting?
Penny,"Well, good for you. Come on in."
Penny,"Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little."
Penny,"So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?"
Penny,"Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies."
Penny,"All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up."
Penny,Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?
Penny,This is all about listening and responding.
Penny,"I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it."
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action."
Penny,"Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?"
Penny,Yogurt?
Penny,"Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
Penny,"Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass."
Penny,"You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?"
Penny,"So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?"
Penny,"Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic."
Penny,Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
Penny,And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?
Penny,Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
Penny,KMN.
Penny,"Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone."
Penny,"Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock."
Penny,It’s only logical.
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene."
Penny,Now just read your mother’s line.
Penny,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
Penny,"Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock."
Penny,Just keep going!
Penny,"We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy."
Penny,"Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little."
Penny,"Well, you’re losing your son."
Penny,"All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue."
Penny,"All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go."
Penny,That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.
Penny,"Okay, I guess we’re improvising now."
Penny,There you go.
Penny,"Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you’ll be fine."
Penny,"Oh, Howard, I can’t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
Penny,"Sheldon, it’s Saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry."
Penny,"Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching."
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay?"
Penny,"Okay, we can’t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you."
Penny,"You’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?"
Penny,What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
Penny,"He still won’t shag the old lady, huh?"
Penny,"Good morning, slut."
Penny,"Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it."
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
Penny,"Again, read the book we gave you."
Penny,Hey!
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you, too."
Penny,Sheldon!
Penny,Okay. Why?
Penny,"Amy, I’m fine."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya."
Penny,"Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?"
Penny,"Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?"
Penny,"Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza."
Penny,"Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose."
Penny,"If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that."
Penny,"Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?"
Penny,I’m fine.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn."
Penny,I didn’t do the audition.
Penny,"Oh, hey. What’s up?"
Penny,Why?
Penny,"I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased  that makes him so happy."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,I smell Chinese food.
Penny,Are Leonard and Priya here?
Penny,Oh. Where’s Raj?
Penny,How about Howard?
Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?"
Penny,Great.
Penny,Not really.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea."
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?"
Penny,Where are all your friends?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?"
Penny,"Oh, the horror."
Penny,Ugh!
Penny,There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
Penny,"Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?"
Penny,"Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?"
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more."
Penny,"Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya."
Penny,A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.
Penny,"Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards."
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,I kind of figured that.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood."
Penny,"Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?"
Penny,All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.
Penny,"So, where do you guys want to go dancing?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?"
Penny,"Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy."
Penny,"Well, yeah, I guess."
Penny,More or less.
Penny,"I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret."
Penny,"Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it."
Penny,"Um, no."
Penny,"Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year."
Penny,"Yeah, it was."
Penny,"Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite."
Penny,"One, two, three, four, five. No way."
Penny,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
Penny,"Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun."
Penny,"Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great."
Penny,I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
Penny,Oopsy.
Penny,"You know, well, I’m happy Leonard’s found someone. Not that anybody asked."
Penny,"Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?"
Penny,"Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose."
Penny,"Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick."
Penny,Come here. 
Penny,Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
Penny,"Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?"
Penny,"Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?"
Penny,You don’t wanna wash that.
Penny,"No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?"
Penny,"You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya."
Penny,"She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there."
Penny,"All right, well I’ll see you later."
Penny,What?
Penny,Did they make a movie about it?
Penny,Then no.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"
Penny,"It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff."
Penny,"Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?"
Penny,"He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?"
Penny,"So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun."
Penny,"Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go."
Penny,"Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work."
Penny,"No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?"
Penny,"Sure, anything."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?"
Penny,"Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you."
Penny,"Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend."
Penny,"No, she doesn’t."
Penny,"It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you."
Penny,You can hear my toilet flush?
Penny,"Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?"
Penny,Are you really that kind of guy?
Penny,"Good-bye, Leonard."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you."
Penny,"Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"
Penny,Just say thank you.
Penny,All right. See you later.
Penny,"Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place."
Penny,"Yeah, well, sadly, I do."
Penny,Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
Penny,"I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water."
Penny,So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
Penny,Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
Penny,"You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes."
Penny,"You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends."
Penny,"No, don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her."
Penny,"No, but I can name all the Kardashians."
Penny,"Okay, be nice."
Penny,Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.
Penny,"Don’t listen to her, she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?"
Penny,"No problem. So, Leonard, I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you."
Penny,So you lied to her. Also interesting.
Penny,"Well, doesn’t matter if she gets it, as long as she’s pretty."
Penny,So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?
Penny,How come?
Penny,All right. Hang on.
Penny,I’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.  This ain’t no Beyonce.
Penny,Give my friend his stuff back.
Penny,"Well, then, good news. Today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back."
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Penny,Going to see Leonard?
Penny,Fine. You?
Penny,"Alright, well great seeing you."
Penny,Amy’s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
Penny,Hey! How’s it going?
Penny,‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
Penny,"Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better."
Penny,You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
Penny,"Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?"
Penny,"Well, then who?"
Penny,"Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion."
Penny,"You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret."
Penny,In confidence!
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?"
Penny,"Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
Penny,"What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Penny,"Well, I know that. How do you know that?"
Penny,"Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense."
Penny,"Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around."
Penny,"All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me."
Penny,I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?"
Penny,What?
Penny,Hey. What’s up?
Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along."
Penny,"Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little."
Penny,"Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out."
Penny,I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
Penny,Pantsuits suck.
Penny,That’s too many S’s for kissing.
Penny,"Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?"
Penny,"Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?"
Penny,"Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing."
Penny,Did you take dance lessons?
Penny,"Oh, we are so taking you dancing."
Penny,Take us to a place we can waltz.
Penny,"Shake it baby, shake it!"
Penny,"Oh, what the hell. Ooh!"
Penny,Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
Penny,I’m fine.
Penny,"Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me."
Penny,Screw it. I’ll go later.
Penny,"Oh, that’s nice."
Penny,"Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
Penny,Wait. What are you talking about?
Penny,"Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card."
Penny,"No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Penny,The what?
Penny,Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
Penny,None?
Penny,Wh… What the hell did she say?
Penny,That bitch!
Penny,"Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie."
Penny,What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
Penny,What?
Penny,"What, are they getting engaged?"
Penny,"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Penny,"Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India."
Penny,Don’t you quit on us!
Penny,"Hey, do me a favour and take table seven."
Penny,"Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie."
Penny,"Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
Penny,"I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said."
Penny,My mirth. Classic.
Penny,"It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber."
Penny,What are you doing at work these days?
Penny,"Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber."
Penny,"Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."
Penny,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going."
Penny,"Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room."
Penny,"Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that."
Penny,"Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car."
Penny,What’s the difference?
Penny,Thanks for clearing that up.
Penny,"Okay, you’re not helping."
Penny,How else is she supposed to take it?
Penny,"Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do. "
Penny,"It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose."
Penny,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Penny,You mean when he was little.
Penny,"You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?"
Penny,"You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up."
Penny,It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
Penny,"It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it."
Penny,"Yeah, I know, right?"
Penny,We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Hey, you guys ready to order?"
Penny,"Okay, Priya?"
Penny,"Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it."
Penny,Oh!
Penny,"Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors."
Penny,"Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy."
Penny,Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
Penny,"What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?"
Penny,"All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?"
Penny,"Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already."
Penny,Hit me.
Penny,Monkeys.
Penny,When a suitcase just won’t do.
Penny,"Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?"
Penny,"What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack."
Penny,"Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
Penny,"Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?"
Penny,I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
Penny,"Oh, you poor baby."
Penny,"Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy."
Penny,"I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship."
Penny,"Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like."
Penny,"Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles."
Penny,You heard what I did?
Penny,"Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore."
Penny,No.
Penny,I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?
Penny,"You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
Penny,You know what? Let’s get out of here.
Penny,Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. 
Penny,Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
Penny,"Yeah, sure. Yay!"
Penny,Sounds great.
Penny,"Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag."
Penny,"You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
Penny,"I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska."
Penny,Why not? 
Penny,How did you know I was here?
Penny,Thanks.
Penny,"So, hi. What’s up?"
Penny,"Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…"
Penny,"Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships."
Penny,"Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?"
Penny,"Oh, you did, didn’t you?"
Penny,"So, we didn’t actually…"
Penny,Oh!
Penny,"Of course I won’t. No, I won’t."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,No.
Penny,Also no.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Hmm.
Penny,"Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. "
Penny,Mm-hmm?
Penny,Hi. You guys have a minute?
Penny,"Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."
Penny,"Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?"
Penny,"Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"I don’t know, maybe teach acting.  Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?"
Penny,"Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday."
Penny,"Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!"
Penny,Shh! Here comes my joke.
Penny,"Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple."
Penny,I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
Penny,I want a divorce.
Penny,"It’s great, isn’t it?"
Penny,What name?
Penny,"Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away."
Penny,"Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
Penny,What is wrong?
Penny,"Sheldon, take it easy."
Penny,I went into this marriage with so much hope.
Penny,Yello.
Penny,"Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions."
Penny,Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
Penny,"Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?"
Penny,Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
Penny,"What’s up, buttercup?"
Penny,Nope.  
Penny,"What’s the word, hummingbird?"
Penny,No. 
Penny,"What’s the gist, physicist?"
Penny,"Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store."
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,And now me.
Penny,And what’s that?
Penny,"No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this."
Penny,Really?
Penny,"My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you."
Penny,Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
Penny,"I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go."
Penny,What’s wrong?
Penny,"Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!"
Penny,"Ooh, me."
Penny,Thank you all for this high honour.
Penny,"All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you."
Penny,"Okay, I’m not driving him."
Penny,You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
Penny,Really? For a wedding?
Penny,Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing."
Penny,Put the corsage on her.
Penny,"Ames, hi. How was the wedding?"
Penny,"Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?"
Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?"
Penny,"Oh, God, did he make a move on you?"
Penny,"Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay."
Penny,"So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?"
Penny,"Yeah, my bikini region is fine."
Penny,"Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone."
Penny,"Well, hello? She’s married."
Penny,"Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat."
Penny,"Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?"
Penny,"Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please."
Penny,"Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf."
Penny,Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
Penny,"Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon."
Penny,Is Raj out with Emily again?
Penny,"Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,"Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf."
Penny,"Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that."
Penny,"Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again."
Penny,"What do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
Penny,"Well, so how much is that?"
Penny,"Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car."
Penny,"What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj."
Penny,No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
Penny,You’re engaged to my friend.
Penny,"I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Um, can we talk to you about Raj?"
Penny,"Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying."
Penny,"Okay, wait…"
Penny,"We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?"
Penny,"Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
Penny,"Okay, come on. You know you can do better."
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Penny,I don’t have feelings.
Penny,He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
Penny,"I know, I know."
Penny,"Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better."
Penny,What? No!
Penny,"Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready."
Penny,"Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now."
Penny,"Wait, what is going on?"
Penny,"No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
Penny,Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
Penny,"No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
Penny,"Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
Penny,"Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."
Penny,Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
Penny,Got it. Just had to check.
Penny,"Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming."
Penny,"Good, good."
Penny,"Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there."
Penny,"Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost."
Penny,"Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?"
Penny,"Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive."
Penny,This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
Penny,"Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
Penny,"Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool."
Penny,"Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good."
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Penny,Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
Penny,What’s with him?
Penny,It’s open.
Penny,"Yeah, sure, come on in."
Penny,Want some mac and cheese?
Penny,Glass of wine?
Penny,"Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from."
Penny,"All right, what’s going on?"
Penny,Yes.
Penny,It’s okay.
Penny,"Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point."
Penny,"Yeah, probably."
Penny,"I’m sorry, go ahead."
Penny,Did you guys do it?
Penny,"Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?"
Penny,That’s gross.
Penny,"Well, good for you."
Penny,So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
Penny,"All right, then break it off with the new girl."
Penny,"If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?"
Penny,"Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
Penny,What does your gut tell you?
Penny,"So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
Penny,"Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh."
Penny,"Okay, that time you looked at me."
Penny,"All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
Penny,"Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving."
Penny,Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
Penny,Why?
Penny,"Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it."
Penny,"Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers"
Penny,"I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?"
Penny,What do you tell him?
Penny,No. All your little secrets are fine.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
Penny,"Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want."
Penny,"With-with loofah mitts, no hands."
Penny,"Yeah, we feel awful."
Penny,"Oh, come on, Amy."
Penny,I don’t really want to.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
Penny,"No, you made that for you, I want you to have it."
Penny,"We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
Penny,"Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too."
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,"Okay, yeah."
Penny,"Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!"
Penny,"Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!"
Penny,"Oh, God. Amy!"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
Penny,Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
Penny,"Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
Penny,"Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?"
Penny,What do you mean?
Penny,"Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
Penny,What is that about?
Penny,"Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?"
Penny,"So movies, yes or no?"
Penny,"Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him."
Penny,"No, I was talking to the bird."
Penny,"Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie."
Penny,"Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,You pick plenty of movies.
Penny,"But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
Penny,"No, you don’t."
Penny,"Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,"Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway."
Penny,No. No woman would.
Penny,"All right, fine."
Penny,"No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t."
Penny,"Uh, no, thanks."
Penny,I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
Penny,To get sex.
Penny,"All right, I’d like an order of fries."
Penny,What you writing there?
Penny,I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
Penny,"Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?"
Penny,So have you written anything I might have seen?
Penny,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?"
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,What am I doing?
Penny,"No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute."
Penny,"Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses."
Penny,"Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically."
Penny,You should.
Penny,Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
Penny,Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
Penny,"Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out."
Penny,"Oh, he had to leave."
Penny,"Huh? I’m sorry, get what?"
Penny,"No, no. I want to know what you told her."
Penny,"Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?"
Penny,Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
Penny,"Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…"
Penny,Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
Penny,Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
Penny,A… S… Take me home.
Penny,"Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
Penny,"All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too."
Penny,Way off.
Penny,"I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Ooh. Maybe I like it.
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Penny,"Well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
Penny,"Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
Penny,"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God."
Penny,What’s wrong?
Penny,"Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
Penny,"Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?"
Penny,"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
Penny,"Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there."
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon. Come on in."
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,"I’m sorry, what?"
Penny,"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back."
Penny,"All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?"
Penny,Mm.
Penny,You’re not the guy.
Penny,I call everyone sweetie.
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
Penny,"Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?"
Penny,Sure.
Penny,What’s yours?
Penny,Basketball Pope.
Penny,What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
Penny,"All right, well, what do you think he wants?"
Penny,Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
Penny,"‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?"
Penny,"Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes."
Penny,"Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose."
Penny,"Oh, that’s awful."
Penny,Wow. You poor thing.
Penny,Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
Penny,"No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
Penny,"No, it was funny. Everyone laughed."
Penny,"Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
Penny,What? I was not a bully.
Penny,"Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school."
Penny,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies."
Penny,That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
Penny,Both.
Penny,I actually knew that.
Penny,"Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?"
Penny,"Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that."
Penny,And helping people.
Penny,"Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago."
Penny,"Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
Penny,"Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
Penny,"Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
Penny,Then sit in the car and keep it running.
Penny,"Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top."
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
Penny,Look at us. What are we doing?
Penny,"You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here."
Penny,"Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy."
Penny,"So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?"
Penny,That is so hot.
Penny,"So, are we ready to order?"
Penny,"Sheldon, what is wrong with you?"
Penny,"Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
Penny,"Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by."
Penny,"Well, just smile and think about koalas."
Penny,"Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff."
Penny,"Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch."
Penny,"Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?"
Penny," Trust me, we are not a couple."
Penny,"Fine, go ahead."
Penny,He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
Penny,"Ooh, are these real diamonds?"
Penny,"Eight o’clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
Penny,"I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Okay, he wants to talk to you."
Penny,"Sheldon, you’re up."
Penny,"Okay, look, he bought you this."
Penny,You look beautiful.
Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
Penny,"You mean, like a date?"
Penny,"Um, o-okay. Sure."
Penny,Just a sec.  Too much?
Penny,"Okay, just hang on."
Penny,"Uh, about two years ago."
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,He’s not dying.
Penny,How about this?
Penny,"Yeah, okay, no."
Penny,"Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, he is not dying."
Penny,Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
Penny,"Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous."
Penny,"I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?"
Penny,"Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?"
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,It’s Penny.
Penny,"Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn."
Penny,Wow. Can they?
Penny,"Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?"
Penny,What does that mean?
Penny,You are so funny.
Penny,"Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this."
Penny,Whoa. Not so fast.
Penny,"Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you."
Penny,What?
Penny,So?
Penny,How would you say it?
Penny,It’s the same thing.
Penny,You’re overthinking this.
Penny,"Yes, you are. You always overthink things."
Penny,"See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
Penny,"Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for."
Penny,Do not overthink this.  
Penny,Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
Penny,No talking.
Penny,"Well, that was fun."
Penny,"You hung in there, though."
Penny,So what do you want to do now?
Penny,"I don’t know, it’s complicated."
Penny,"Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked."
Penny,"Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?"
Penny,"Come on, be serious."
Penny,So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
Penny,"Well, we don’t really have to pretend."
Penny,"Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers."
Penny,"Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t."
Penny,"Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?"
Penny,"No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out."
Penny,"Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"
Penny,Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
Penny,"Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right."
Penny,You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
Penny,Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
Penny,"No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag."
Penny,The hell do you think you’re going?
Penny,"Yeah, kind of, yeah."
Penny,What do you mean?
Penny,That’s because you overthink everything.
Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
Penny,"Uh, have you thought this through?"
Penny,"Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore."
Penny,That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
Penny,You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
Penny,"I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow."
Penny,"Okay, well, maybe not that slow."
Penny,"You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not."
Penny,You mean like a beta test?
Penny,"Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?"
Penny,All right. Let’s give it a shot.
Penny,"Okay. Good night, Leonard."
Penny,"Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?"
Penny,"Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV."
Penny,Even Doctor Who.
Penny,"Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow."
Penny,What’s this?
Penny,"Well, that’s quite a list you got there."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,Yep.
Penny,Yep.
Penny,It’s open.
Penny,"Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter."
Penny,"No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more."
Penny,Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
Penny,"All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
Penny,"Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there."
Penny,This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
Penny,"Okay, you’re kind of really great."
Penny,"Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up."
Penny,And stop apologizing all the time.
Penny,"All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?"
Penny,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. 
Penny,"No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
Penny,"Well, thank you for a really cool evening."
Penny,Things are looking good.
Penny,"Good night, you."
Penny,What does that mean?
Penny,"Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?"
Penny,"Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
Penny,"You know, I got some candles in my apartment."
Penny,I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
Penny,"You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?"
Penny,Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
Penny,"Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,But he’s sad.
Penny,I think he misses his little buddy.
Penny,"Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
Penny,Leonard’s Day?
Penny,I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
Penny,Why wouldn’t you?
Penny,Ouch.
Penny,"You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for."
Penny,"Hey, you."
Penny,"Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?"
Penny,What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
Penny,"So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
Penny,"I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes."
Penny,"Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations."
Penny,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
Penny,No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
Penny,You and Amy? Good?
Penny,You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
Penny,"All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
Penny,"A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge."
Penny,"Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything."
Penny,Okay. 
Penny,Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
Penny,Do I like it? Wow.
Penny,"Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…"
Penny,"Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow."
Penny,So big.
Penny,So ugly. What am I gonna do?
Penny,Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
Penny,"All right, it’s got to go."
Penny,How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
Penny,"Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy."
Penny,I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
Penny,"Good night, real Amy."
Penny,Bye.
Penny,"Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish."
Penny,"Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye."
Penny,It’s right over there.
Penny,I have no idea. That is weird.
Penny,"No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big."
Penny,"No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up."
Penny,"Oh, Amy, come on."
Penny,I came to say I’m sorry.
Penny,"Oh, Amy, please."
Penny,I know.
Penny,You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
Penny,I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
Penny,"Amy, come on…"
Penny,"Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life."
Penny,Grab your hammer.
Penny,"Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."
Penny,"Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…"
Penny,"Huh, I try."
Penny,Well where are we going?
Penny,"Well, what about Bernadette?"
Penny,How’s that?
Penny,Now?
Penny,"Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good."
Penny,Mm.
Penny,"Yeah, good call."
Penny,"You’re talking about the painting, right?"
Penny,"You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you."
Penny,"So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?"
Penny,"Well, is it or isn’t it?"
Penny,"Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy."
Penny,So did I win or not?
Penny,"Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move."
Penny,"Okay, what just happened?"
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand."
Penny,"You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen."
Penny,"If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
Penny,Why did you get bongos?
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
Penny,Where are you going?
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair."
Penny,"All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."
Penny,"It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair."
Penny,Almost done.
Penny,"Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes."
Penny,"Okay, what do you think?"
Penny,"Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
Penny,"Okay.  Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay."
Penny,"You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move."
Penny,You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
Penny,"Really, what were you hoping for?"
Penny,"Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again."
Penny,"Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi."
Penny,An acting choice.
Penny,"Choo got a problem with that, papi?"
Penny,"Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here."
Penny,Gummy bears? Thank you.
Penny,Not a chance.
Penny,"All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship."
Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Penny,What’s that?
Penny,"Amy, what’s wrong?"
Penny,"Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?"
Penny,Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
Penny,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
Penny,Mm.
Penny,"Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all."
Penny,Yes. On purpose.
Penny,"Well, sickly is the new sexy."
Penny,"Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
Penny,That’s hilarious. No.
Penny,"Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…"
Penny,"Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?"
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. "
Penny,Wars.
Penny,Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
Penny,There’s absolutely no difference.
Penny,"All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment."
Penny,Hmm.
Penny,"All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
Penny,"That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s."
Penny,"Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!"
Penny,"Ooh, burn!"
Penny,"Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush."
Penny,"No, Sheldon hurt you."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…"
Penny,"And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go."
Penny,I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
Penny,"Oh my God, I love this chicken."
Penny,"Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
Penny,He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
Penny,"Hi, you guys got a minute?"
Penny,"Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
Penny,"Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!"
Penny,"Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store."
Penny,"Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good."
Penny,"Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?"
Penny,"You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker."
Penny,"Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!"
Penny,"Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there."
Penny,"Why, they’re just toys?"
Penny,C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
Penny,That was weird.
Penny,I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
Penny,I dunno. I just think it’s a waste.  Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
Penny,What is your problem?
Penny,"Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,What?
Penny,"I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this."
Penny,"You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him."
Penny,What is the truth?
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
Penny,"Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her."
Penny,Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time."
Penny,"I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?"
Penny,Well…
Penny,"I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
Penny,"Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."
Penny,"See, there it is, there’s that twinkle."
Penny,"What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?"
Penny,"Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason."
Penny,"So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
Penny,Why should I worry?
Penny,"Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
Penny,Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
Penny,"Well, have fun tonight."
Penny,"Yeah, there is."
Penny,"Yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
Penny,"Okay, show’s over."
Penny,I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?
Penny,"Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up."
Penny,"Oh, that’s cool."
Penny,"Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?"
Penny,Not.
Penny,"Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em."
Penny,"Well, a little. You hear stuff."
Penny,"Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
Penny,"Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this."
Penny,Amy.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
Penny,"Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you."
Penny,"Oh, what the hell. "
Penny,What’s with the robe?
Penny,"No, you’re not."
Penny,"If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet."
Penny,"Hey, you."
Penny,"For the record, not your worst opening line."
Penny,"B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?"
Penny,"Okay.  What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!"
Penny,"Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father."
Penny,"Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
Penny,"Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
Penny,"Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
Penny,Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
Penny,"Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that."
Penny,"No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
Penny,"Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
Penny,"You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,It’s not funny.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Okay, you, too."
Penny,"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too."
Penny,You’re right.  No.
Penny,Yep.
Penny,Yep.
Penny,No!
Penny,"Amy, you look great."
Penny,It wasn’t a real proposal.
Penny,Good move telling Sheldon.
Penny,"Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas."
Penny,"Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…"
Penny,"Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want."
Penny,"Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other."
Penny,Problem?
Penny,"Oh, grow up."
Penny,"Well, he started it."
Penny,Did I miss it?
Penny,"I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying."
Penny,"Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?"
Penny,That’s hot. You kids better use protection.
Penny,Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?
Penny,"Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?"
Penny,"Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex."
Penny,This is great. What’s the occasion?
Penny,That is so sweet.
Penny,Go Sports?
Penny,This is awesome. I love it!
Penny,"Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed."
Penny,"Ah, thank you!"
Penny,"Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day."
Penny,Great.
Penny,"Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?"
Penny,Thank you. 
Penny,"No, we don’t! Come on in!"
Penny,"Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?"
Penny,"All right, who’s ready for another beer?"
Penny,Girls.
Penny,"Okay, hold on…"
Penny,That’s enough.
Penny,Raj.
Penny,"Ooh, one gravy boat."
Penny,"One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat."
Penny,"Ew, why?"
Penny,What about me what?
Penny,"Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great."
Penny,He’s a sweetie.
Penny,"Yeah, sure, of course I love him."
Penny,"Well, I do."
Penny,"No, he’d just take it the wrong way."
Penny,It means he is special and smart and nice and…
Penny,No. Maybe. I don’t know.
Penny,"That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?"
Penny,"Amy, you?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. Sheldon?"
Penny,What are you doing in my bedroom?
Penny,"How did you even get in, you weirdo?"
Penny,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Penny,Talk about what?
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,"Okay, go home, crazy man."
Penny,"Okay, what did Amy tell you?"
Penny,"Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?"
Penny,Of course not.
Penny,Worst bedtime story ever.
Penny,"Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?"
Penny,Get out.
Penny,What?
Penny,That is the last thing I want to do.
Penny,Get out.
Penny,What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
Penny,Really?
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,Uh-huh.
Penny,"Look, there’s something I need to tell you."
Penny,I don’t really know how to say this.
Penny,Okay. Here goes.
Penny,"I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes."
Penny,He looked at me like this.
Penny,"Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis."
Penny,"Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom."
Penny,M-hmm.
Penny,"Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?"
Penny,"Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?"
Penny,"Really, your potty training journal?"
Penny,"August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?"
Penny,"Oh, disgusting."
Penny,Why do you need all this stuff?
Penny,Sorry!
Penny,"Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s basically what I said."
Penny,You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
Penny,Maybe I could do it.
Penny,"A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?"
Penny,"Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."
Penny,"Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?"
Penny,What?
Penny,Maybe he didn’t notice.
Penny,"No, you do not."
Penny,"Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon."
Penny,"Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking."
Penny,"Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about."
Penny,Can we go now?
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,"Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work."
Penny,There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
Penny,"Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now."
Penny,"Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries."
Penny,"Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny."
Penny,"So, how was work today?"
Penny,Oh! You’re kidding.
Penny,Wow. Anything else?
Penny,"Oh, is that it?"
Penny,"Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny."
Penny,In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
Penny,"Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey."
Penny,My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
Penny,You’re unbelievable.
Penny,How about boys versus girls?
Penny,"Once again, unbelievable."
Penny,"All right, round one. Here."
Penny,"Okay. Ready, set, go."
Penny,Present! Yeah!
Penny,"Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them."
Penny,It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
Penny,"Relax, we got time, this is so fun."
Penny,Soon.
Penny,"All right, that’s enough. "
Penny,Yep!
Penny,"Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?"
Penny,"I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers."
Penny,"All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything."
Penny,"Oh, come on, what is that?"
Penny,"No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…"
Penny,I don’t think so.
Penny,"Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo."
Penny,"Yes, we win again."
Penny,37
Penny,Mwah!
Penny,Mwah!
Penny,"All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins."
Penny,I hope so.
Penny,It’s not getting any better.  Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
Penny,"I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy."
Penny,"I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?"
Penny,"Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time."
Penny,"Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?"
Penny,Letting him make me happy.
Penny,I guess I could probably try a little harder.
Penny,"Yeah, that’s kind of a problem."
Penny,Not really clear on what he does.
Penny,"Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means."
Penny,"Yeah, you’re really just making it worse."
Penny,Anybody home?
Penny,I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.
Penny,"No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend."
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,Ooh! What’s going on in here?
Penny,"What, is it secret?"
Penny,Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
Penny,"Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?"
Penny,Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?
Penny,"Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?"
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
Penny,Wow. That is amazing.
Penny,What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!
Penny,Hmm.
Penny,Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
Penny,Take off your clothes.
Penny,Yeah. You got a problem with that?
Penny,Really? Never?
Penny,Whoa! That’s heavy.
Penny,No. Why?
Penny,Whoa! That is very cool.
Penny,"Getting a little less cool, Leonard."
Penny,There we go.
Penny,"Oh, my God, you guys look adorable."
Penny,"No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges."
Penny,"I thought we said in the car, no accents?"
Penny,"Oh, I’ll get that."
Penny,"No, no, it’s…"
Penny,"No, it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College."
Penny,"It’s just one history class. Look, I didn’t finish college, so I thought I would give it a try."
Penny,"No, I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to know because I haven’t told Leonard yet."
Penny,"Because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can I help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!"
Penny,Really? You can’t think of anyone weirder?
Penny,Spaghetti okay?
Penny,"Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling."
Penny,"Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college."
Penny,I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.
Penny,You’re making it a big deal.
Penny,"Anyway, that’s it. I just thought you should know."
Penny,It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
Penny,"Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor’s black, so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer."
Penny,"No, Leonard, this is my thing."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl."
Penny,Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the night.
Penny,"Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?"
Penny,"Elves? Come on, Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of the Rings."
Penny,"Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?"
Penny,So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
Penny,What?
Penny,You changed every word.
Penny,You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
Penny,"Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress."
Penny,"Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?"
Penny,"Yeah, well, next time don’t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker"
Penny,Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you. Minus.
Penny,"That’s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf."
Penny,"Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you’re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I’m the one who learned a lesson. I’m so stupid, Penny. Duh."
Penny,I don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
Penny,"So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges."
Penny,"Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A."
Penny,Believable? You saying I’m not smart?
Penny,That’s better.
Penny,"Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is."
Penny,"No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?"
Penny,"Yeah, right."
Penny,I’ve seen her burp you.
Penny,"Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave."
Penny,"Wow, excuse me."
Penny,Hey. What brings you in?
Penny,I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
Penny,"And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?"
Penny,You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
Penny,It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Penny,"Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?"
Penny,"Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle."
Penny,"Honey, you can’t make people like each other."
Penny,You might want to pace yourself.
Penny,"Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy."
Penny,"Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk."
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,"Welcome to Long Island, Tex."
Penny,"Yeah, that she is. Here you go."
Penny,"No, she won’t."
Penny,"So, how was work today?"
Penny,That sounds like fun.
Penny,"Oh, good, I guessed right."
Penny,"Oh, just this guy I met at school."
Penny,Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
Penny,"Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody."
Penny,"No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best."
Penny,It didn’t come up.
Penny,What am I supposed to say?
Penny,Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
Penny,Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Penny,Nothing.
Penny,Did your boyfriend make you type that?
Penny,Don’t be like that.
Penny,"No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work."
Penny,"If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class."
Penny,"Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"
Penny,I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
Penny,"Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?"
Penny,Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
Penny,What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
Penny,"Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying."
Penny,"Yeah. So, how you doing?"
Penny,"Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax."
Penny,"Hey, anybody want a drink?"
Penny,I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
Penny,"Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?"
Penny,"You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea."
Penny,Damn.
Penny,"Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."
Penny,"Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos."
Penny,"No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  Oh, I’ll get it."
Penny,Ow! Ow!
Penny,"You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!"
Penny,Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
Penny,Thanks. Ah!
Penny,"Gee, you think?"
Penny,"Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room."
Penny,S’up?
Penny,"Step one, worms."
Penny,"Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up."
Penny,You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
Penny,What are you waiting for?
Penny,Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
Penny,"Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face."
Penny,"That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up."
Penny,"Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  You want me to stop?"
Penny,"All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh, my God. What is with you guys?"
Penny,"What, never?"
Penny,"Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull."
Penny,"Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. "
Penny,"Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs."
Penny,You’re so butch.
Penny,Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
Penny,Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?
Penny,"Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?"
Penny,"See you, boys. We are going drinking."
Penny,Come on.
Penny,No!
Penny,"Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst."
Penny,"Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?"
Penny,"Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you."
Penny,Nines or tens?
Penny,"Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean."
Penny,"So, how’d it go?"
Penny,Ooh!
Penny,"Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them."
Penny,"Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?"
Penny,What?
Penny,What is happening?
Penny,You’re talking about Leonard.
Penny,"Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?"
Penny,Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
Penny,I’m gonna kill her.
Penny,"We know what’s going on, Sheldon!"
Penny,What? He’s loving it?
Penny,"Oh, you seem extra happy."
Penny,Any particular reason why?
Penny,Mm-hmm. Anything else?
Penny,That’s great.
Penny,"Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day."
Penny,"Oh, and who’s that?"
Penny,"Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex."
Penny,Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
Penny,"Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!"
Penny,"Oh, damn it, you are."
Penny,"I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?"
Penny,"Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?"
Penny,Why are you smiling?
Penny,"Well, I do."
Penny,Good.
Penny,What’s that?
Penny,Can I tell you a secret?
Penny,"Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we’re all gonna stop."
Penny,What did you do?
Penny,"So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex."
Penny,"I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes."
Penny,"No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these."
Penny,"I know, right? Watch this. Molecules."
Penny,Where are we going?
Penny,Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
Penny,"Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this."
Penny,I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
Penny,Is that better?
Penny,"Well, then why are you going?"
Penny,"All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,What was that for?
Penny,"Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch."
Penny,I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
Penny,"Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie."
Penny,Uh-uh.
Penny,"That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?"
Penny,"Hey, Stuart."
Penny,"No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try."
Penny,"Well then, what do you recommend?"
Penny,As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
Penny,"Ooh, Thor! He’s hot."
Penny,"Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?"
Penny,"Yeah, well, I have street smarts."
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,Stupid?
Penny,I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
Penny,I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
Penny,"That makes even less sense, I mean…"
Penny,"Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?"
Penny,"Well, which is it?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Wait, I thought we were reading."
Penny,Yes!
Penny,You said it’s a magic hammer.
Penny,"If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?"
Penny,"Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that."
Penny,"Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?"
Penny,"Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?"
Penny,It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
Penny,"Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one."
Penny,"Honey, if you want one, just get one."
Penny,I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
Penny,"Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust."
Penny,What is that?
Penny,"Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?"
Penny,What beverage do you make for that?
Penny,"All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?"
Penny,"That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter."
Penny,"Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?"
Penny,You ever going to sleep with Amy?
Penny,"Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?"
Penny,"All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?"
Penny,Then what’s the problem?
Penny,Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
Penny,"Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."
Penny,Wow. Where are you going to go?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie."
Penny,"Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same."
Penny,"Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?"
Penny,"Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you."
Penny,"Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke."
Penny,"No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step."
Penny,"Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty."
Penny,I got nothing.
Penny,"Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work."
Penny,"Oh, please let some of it be Xanax."
Penny,Hey. What’s going on?
Penny,Really? Interesting.
Penny,It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
Penny,"Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine."
Penny,"Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings."
Penny,"That is the worst, isn’t it?"
Penny,What did I do?
Penny,"Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me."
Penny,"No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast."
Penny,"Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano."
Penny,"Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional."
Penny,"Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth."
Penny,Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
Penny,"Hey, Ames."
Penny,"Sheldon, what did you say?"
Penny,"Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready."
Penny,"And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?"
Penny,"Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are."
Penny,Um…
Penny,You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
Penny,"This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life."
Penny,"No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him."
Penny,"Yeah, that was the point of the story."
Penny,"Um, I think so. Why?"
Penny,"Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something."
Penny,"No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out."
Penny,"You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that."
Penny,This place is really beautiful.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,No problem. We just sat down.
Penny,Is everything okay?
Penny,"Oh, son of a bitch."
Penny,Nothing. Nothing.
Penny,It’s just this guy I used to date.
Penny,"Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now."
Penny,"And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it."
Penny,"No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying."
Penny,"You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs."
Penny,"What?  Oh, you got to be kidding me."
Penny,Get up.
Penny,"Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with."
Penny,"What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too."
Penny,"Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that."
Penny,"We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Penny,"Oh, come on, don’t make this about you."
Penny,"Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks."
Penny,What?
Penny,Night.
Penny,"Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch."
Penny,"Well, I am."
Penny,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.
Penny,"Obviously, I have some commitment issues."
Penny,"As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out."
Penny,"What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?"
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Yeah, you got it."
Penny,"Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you."
Penny,Leonard Hofstadter?
Penny,Will you be my valentine?
Penny,Hello.
Penny,"Yeah, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I just couldn’t join in."
Penny,"Uh, I’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?"
Penny,"I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in my acting class."
Penny,"Yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in."
Penny,Let’s try open.
Penny,"Um, well, I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?"
Penny,"Oh, hi. What’s up?"
Penny,You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
Penny,"Okay. So, what do you need?"
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Aw, sweetie, you just made my day."
Penny,"Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Hey, I don’t want you to go any more."
Penny,"You should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to."
Penny,Okay. Do whatever you want.
Penny,"Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play."
Penny,"I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand what that is."
Penny,Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
Penny,"Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events."
Penny,"So, blow off work, go on a weekday."
Penny,It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
Penny,I can laugh about it now.
Penny,I’m in.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?"
Penny,"Yeah, that’s a toughie."
Penny,"I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye."
Penny,"You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?"
Penny,"All right, whatever. How does it work?"
Penny,Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Unless you want to be Cinderella.
Penny,"I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?"
Penny,"Ooh, it smells good."
Penny,"Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?"
Penny,What is your point?
Penny,Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
Penny,It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
Penny,"Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,"No, we just want information."
Penny,We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
Penny,What did it say?
Penny,Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
Penny,"Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?"
Penny,"Yeah, obviously."
Penny,"Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,I know.
Penny,"We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…"
Penny,"Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it."
Penny,"It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave."
Penny,"Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?"
Penny,"This turned out pretty well, huh?"
Penny,"Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him."
Penny,Party’s over! Party’s over!
Penny,So tenured means a job for life?
Penny,You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
Penny,"Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,"She’d be proud, huh?"
Penny,"So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?"
Penny,That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.
Penny,"Oh, good, you heard me."
Penny,"Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing."
Penny,"Oh, what a jerk."
Penny,"Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?"
Penny,Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
Penny,"Oh, then you all can get tenure."
Penny,"I’m here to support my man, just like you."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another demerit."
Penny,"Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet."
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?"
Penny,"As a rule, no."
Penny,"Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?"
Penny,I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
Penny,It’s six thirty in the morning.
Penny,It was cute.
Penny,What’s wrong with cute?
Penny,So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
Penny,I liked it. I’m excited.
Penny,What do you want from me?
Penny,"Oh, come on, don’t be like that."
Penny,I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.
Penny,"Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth."
Penny,"Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs."
Penny,"Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?"
Penny,"Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it."
Penny,"I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?"
Penny,"See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys."
Penny,You think?
Penny,"Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work."
Penny,"So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy."
Penny,"See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you."
Penny,"No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about."
Penny,"Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now."
Penny,"It is, isn’t it?"
Penny,"Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke."
Penny,"Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you’re in my life."
Penny,Got it.
Penny,"Eh, his giant head did most of the work."
Penny,Who’s Professor Proton?
Penny,"Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton."
Penny,"Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti."
Penny,"Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late."
Penny,Hello.
Penny,"So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?"
Penny,I think I know.
Penny,"Okay, I didn’t know."
Penny,"See, I’m not a scientist like them."
Penny,What’s that?
Penny,"Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?"
Penny,I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
Penny,"But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
Penny,"Arthur, are you okay?"
Penny,Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
Penny,We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
Penny,"Vegas, here we come."
Penny,No.
Penny,"I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these."
Penny,"I’m sorry, why old?"
Penny,Guess who?
Penny,"Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it."
Penny,"Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has."
Penny,"Okay, who wants a drink?"
Penny,"Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you."
Penny,I drink my potion.
Penny,"You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll."
Penny,"Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?"
Penny,"Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money."
Penny,"More potion, please."
Penny,Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.
Penny,"No, it’s not."
Penny,"Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?"
Penny,"Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…"
Penny,"So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
Penny,"Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
Penny,I thought I said that to you.
Penny,"Wow, Hawking. Good for you."
Penny,"Well, how long?"
Penny,Whoa. When would you leave?
Penny,"Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you."
Penny,On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
Penny,"Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it."
Penny,Okay. Good.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,"Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?"
Penny,"Sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
Penny,"Bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
Penny,"You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
Penny,What the hell?
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,"Yeah, it does, and here we are."
Penny,"Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him."
Penny,"Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out."
Penny,"Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard."
Penny,"Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job."
Penny,"It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…"
Penny,"I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Like this. I am so happy for you.
Penny,Cheers.
Penny,"Raj, I’m so sorry."
Penny,"Well, here we are."
Penny,"I’m gonna miss you, too."
Penny,"Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…"
Penny,Did you bring enough inhalers?
Penny,"And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
Penny,I love you.
Penny,"Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?"
Penny,Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.
Penny,"Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?"
Penny,Oh. I’m so sorry.
Penny,"Oh, Raj."
Penny,"I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too."
Penny,You will.
Penny,That’s just the booze talking.
Penny,You’re talking to me.
Penny,"Oh, me, too."
Penny,That’s great. Do you want some wine?
Penny,What’s the matter?
Penny,"Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?"
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Good night.
Penny,You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
Penny,No.
Penny,Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,"Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot."
Penny,"All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Why?
Penny,Really? Why?
Penny,"So that means I lose, right? It’s over?"
Penny,"Okay, let’s take a break. "
Penny,"I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much."
Penny,I’m calling him.
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,"Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time."
Penny,"Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you."
Penny,"Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk."
Penny,I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
Penny,No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
Penny,"Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?"
Penny,"No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain."
Penny,This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
Penny,"Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now."
Penny,He did?
Penny,"Oh, that’s really sweet."
Penny,"Well, now I miss him even more."
Penny,Thanks.
Penny,Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
Penny,How about we just talk?
Penny,"No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know."
Penny,"Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
Penny,How about I go first?
Penny,"Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out."
Penny,"Oh, God."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,That’s your big revelation?
Penny,"Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed."
Penny,What did I do?
Penny,"I, I didn’t think it was a big deal."
Penny,"Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better."
Penny,Thank you. How about a hug?
Penny,Come on.
Penny,Aaaaaaah!
Penny,Another? Great.
Penny,"Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere."
Penny,"You know, I will miss this."
Penny,I won’t.
Penny,"Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card."
Penny,"Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday."
Penny,"Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?"
Penny,"Oh, that is so romantic."
Penny,"Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here."
Penny,Ah.
Penny,"Oh.  Oh, that’s the pizza."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change."
Penny,"Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana."
Penny,That’s nice.
Penny,"Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!"
Penny,"No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…"
Penny,Well…
Penny,"Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom."
Penny,"Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."
Penny,Oh. 
Penny,"Um, what?"
Penny,So? That’s my dinner from last night.
Penny,"Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
Penny,What?
Penny,No.
Penny,What the hell?
Penny,"Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. "
Penny,"No, he doesn’t."
Penny,It was fine.
Penny,"Ooh, now we’re talking."
Penny,"Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
Penny,"He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?"
Penny,"I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,"Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months."
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
Penny,"Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer."
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me."
Penny,"Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah."
Penny,"No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!"
Penny,Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
Penny,"All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit."
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go."
Penny,"But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on."
Penny,"Okay, it’s not gonna say that."
Penny,"It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store."
Penny,"Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up."
Penny,People run in a marathon.
Penny,Riddle me this…
Penny,"Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead."
Penny,"Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh."
Penny,"Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
Penny,Shut up. I solved it.
Penny,"Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?"
Penny,"Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley."
Penny,Let’s go.
Penny,"Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here."
Penny,What? Why me?
Penny,"Okay, the clue must be in the bag."
Penny,It’s just a bunch of pants.
Penny,"You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team. "
Penny,What are you talking about?
Penny,"Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,But wait. So does this one.
Penny,Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
Penny,"Well, where the hell’s the coin?"
Penny,I don’t get it.
Penny,That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. 
Penny,Run.
Penny,Run to India.
Penny,Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
Penny,"Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter."
Penny,Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
Penny,"Oh, cool. Are there pictures?"
Penny,"Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?"
Penny,Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
Penny,"Oh, my God, you still go left."
Penny,"Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?"
Penny,I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
Penny,You were wearing her bra.
Penny,"Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
Penny,"Well, why were you so angry?"
Penny,"Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better."
Penny,Really? Are you sure about that?
Penny,"Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys."
Penny,"Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…"
Penny,"Hey, what’s going on with you?"
Penny,"All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?"
Penny,"‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go."
Penny,I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
Penny,"And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you."
Penny,Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.
Penny,"Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night."
Penny,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
Penny,"You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys."
Penny,"Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it."
Penny,"Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do."
Penny,That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
Penny,"Oh, no."
Penny,Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?"
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?"
Penny,"Nope, got to go with Amy on this one."
Penny,"All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
Penny,What are you working on?
Penny,Do you know what he’s doing?
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready."
Penny,"Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
Penny,Ah.
Penny,"Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
Penny,I can name tons.
Penny,"Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
Penny,"I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to."
Penny,"Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off."
Penny,Sheldon?
Penny,Thank you so much for coming.
Penny,"Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this."
Penny,"Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count."
Penny,"I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
Penny,"Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head."
Penny,That’s from Say Anything.
Penny,"I get that, but why is this so hard?"
Penny,"Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t."
Penny,"Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this."
Penny,"Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face."
Penny,"Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me."
Penny,What?
Penny,"I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."
Penny,"Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why."
Penny,Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
Penny,"Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you."
Penny,It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
Penny,What?
Penny,No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
Penny,"Oh, my God, I am the worst."
Penny,"No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it."
Penny,Of course I did. It’s you.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all."
Penny,"Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue."
Penny,"Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader."
Penny,"Yeah, I’m just making a mess."
Penny,When did I have pistachios?
Penny,"Hey, guys, what do you think?"
Penny,"Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink."
Penny,What’s going on with them?
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Penny,"Ooh, that looks like fun."
Penny,"Oh, that’s amazing,"
Penny,"Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds."
Penny,"Hey, Arthur. How are you?"
Penny,"Sorry, they’re both married."
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Penny,"You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play."
Penny,What window?
Penny,"Ooh, what are you gonna get?"
Penny,"Aw, did she hate you?"
Penny,"No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go."
Penny,"Yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
Penny,I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
Penny,I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
Penny,I’m gonna go talk to her.
Penny,I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?
Penny,"Yeah, well, you’re short."
Penny,"Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?"
Penny,"Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you."
Penny,"Oh, you know, he’s good."
Penny,"Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
Penny,"Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him."
Penny,"I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?"
Penny,"You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess."
Penny,"Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?"
Penny,"Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?"
Penny,"Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club."
Penny,"Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon."
Penny,What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?
Penny,"Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back."
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?
Penny,Which is?
Penny,"Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell."
Penny,"Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins."
Penny,Smile.
Penny,So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
Penny,There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
Penny,"Yes, it is."
Penny,"Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
Penny,"Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
Penny,I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
Penny,That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
Penny,Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
Penny,"Uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas."
Penny,"Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."
Penny,Yeah. 
Penny,We had one of those silly fake weddings.
Penny,"No, they’re not."
Penny,"No, they’re not."
Penny,But it didn’t seem real.
Penny,"Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof."
Penny,I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
Penny,So how do I undo this?
Penny,"Great, well, what do I have to do?"
Penny,Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
Penny,Here. Thank you for having us.
Penny,I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
Penny,Fine.
Penny,Are you done?
Penny,"Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?"
Penny,"Ugh, I need some air."
Penny,"Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now."
Penny,Yeah. 
Penny,"Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…"
Penny,"Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down."
Penny,"Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,We don’t have any kids.
Penny,"Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator."
Penny,"Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it."
Penny,"Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
Penny,"Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face."
Penny,I’m about to. Sign the paper.
Penny,"Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money."
Penny,"How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon."
Penny,"Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras."
Penny,"Hey, what’s with all the yelling?"
Penny,"Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled, "
Penny,"He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"
Penny,"Actually, I get what he’s saying."
Penny,"It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
Penny,Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
Penny,"You know, if it makes you feel any better…"
Penny,You’re probably right.
Penny,"Wow, you’re really good at this."
Penny,How you doing over there?
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?"
Penny,"Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon."
Penny,"Wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
Penny,"Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template."
Penny,Ah.
Penny,"Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Hi. 
Penny,"Hey, how’s your sister?"
Penny,"Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars."
Penny,"Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?"
Penny,"Oh, you weren’t joking."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down."
Penny,"Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?"
Penny,A few minutes it is.
Penny,Yeah?
Penny,Really? You don’t sound so sure.
Penny,What’s that?
Penny,I think you’re too late.
Penny,"Sure, why?"
Penny,Why? 
Penny,Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
Penny,"Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself."
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,"Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half."
Penny,We do?
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,Doing laundry?
Penny,"Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them."
Penny,"Okay, that’s enough."
Penny,"So, what do you think?"
Penny,"Please, Sheldon. I need you."
Penny,To take me.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here."
Penny,I think I know how to change your mind.
Penny,Great.
Penny,"What do you mean, not exactly?"
Penny,"Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?"
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Who’s that?
Penny,You guys need anything else?
Penny,"I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?"
Penny,"Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this."
Penny,I just got a part on a TV show.
Penny,"Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!"
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon."
Penny,"Well, yeah. Why?"
Penny,"Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night."
Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat."
Penny,We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
Penny,"Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Penny,"Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?"
Penny,"No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone."
Penny,They must’ve cut it.
Penny,"This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me."
Penny,"Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating."
Penny,"Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen."
Penny,Unbelievable.
Penny,Then what did you mean?
Penny,I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
Penny,"I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion."
Penny,Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
Penny,So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
Penny,"Yes, honestly."
Penny,How could you say that?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life."
Penny,"Wow, thank you."
Penny,You didn’t get your part cut.
Penny,"And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!"
Penny,"We can, but the part of Penny might get cut."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Are you serious? For what?
Penny,What? How did you manage that?
Penny,"Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt."
Penny,"Really, let it go."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic."
Penny,"Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart."
Penny,"No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess."
Penny,"Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there."
Penny,"No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it."
Penny,You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
Penny,"Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?"
Penny,Did you seriously just say um?
Penny,"Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?"
Penny,"No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table."
Penny,I’m gonna go.
Penny,"No, no, I just need to be alone."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think."
Penny,Yeah. Come in.
Penny,Leonard…
Penny,"Listen, I don’t want to break up with you."
Penny,"Yeah, I probably wouldn’t."
Penny,"Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
Penny,"Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,I know.
Penny,I already quit.
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,You okay?
Penny,Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
Penny,"Oh. Well, good boy."
Penny,"Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
Penny,Okay. You want to come with me?
Penny,"Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on."
Penny,Hi. What’s up?
Penny,"Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
Penny,I didn’t get it.
Penny,Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
Penny,No. I’m serious.
Penny,Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
Penny,Really?
Penny,Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
Penny,"Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car."
Penny,"And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold."
Penny,"Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today."
Penny,And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
Penny,"I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
Penny,"Sheldon, take a break."
Penny,"Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?"
Penny,"Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?"
Penny,"Yeah, well, maybe we do."
Penny,"Okay, wait. What are we doing?"
Penny,"Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot."
Penny,"You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it."
Penny,"Well, it’s scary for me, too."
Penny,Okay. Thank you.
Penny,What’s going on?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
Penny,"Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
Penny,To be cool? Yeah.
Penny,"Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
Penny,What? You were all going as the Hulk?
Penny,And we’re back to the first kind of sad.
Penny,I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. 
Penny,"Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want."
Penny,"Yes, like a museum, but anything else."
Penny,"Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear."
Penny,"No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way."
Penny,I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
Penny,"Well, there’s a bar in the lobby."
Penny,"So, afternoon tea was a bust."
Penny,"Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do."
Penny,"Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
Penny,"I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there."
Penny,"Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
Penny,Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
Penny,"I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?"
Penny,"I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
Penny,"Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
Penny,"No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
Penny,That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
Penny,"You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy."
Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
Penny,Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
Penny,"Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?"
Penny,Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
Penny,Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
Penny,"Oh, that’s true. "
Penny,That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,"No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs."
Penny,We gotta get her to a vet right now.
Penny,Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
Penny,A whole box.
Penny,So the point is I may have saved her life.
Penny,"Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas."
Penny,Do you know how much gas is?
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
Penny,"Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long."
Penny,I think there’s something going on between the two of them.
Penny,"Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while."
Penny,I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
Penny,Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
Penny,How is everything?
Penny,"Oh, good."
Penny,Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition."
Penny,"How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?"
Penny,Just shut up.
Penny,"No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor."
Penny,"Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?"
Penny,Translation?
Penny,"Ooh, this one looks nice."
Penny,Why not?
Penny,"Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here."
Penny,"All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too."
Penny,No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
Penny,"See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time."
Penny,Really? This one?
Penny,"Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it."
Penny,"Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot."
Penny,"Come on, that is ridiculous."
Penny,That’s not what I’m saying.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Me?
Penny,Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
Penny,"Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you."
Penny,"Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train."
Penny,"Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life."
Penny,Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, wait."
Penny,"Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you."
Penny,"Well, I’m glad you’re still together."
Penny,"You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…"
Penny,"Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?"
Penny,"Yeah, let’s go."
Penny,"Forget it, Leonard. It’s over."
Penny,"Aw, thank you."
Penny,"Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week."
Penny,Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Penny,"Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet."
Penny,"Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career."
Penny,"Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”"
Penny,"Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices."
Penny,"Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?"
Penny,"Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now."
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Penny,Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
Penny,"I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions."
Penny,I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
Penny,"How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life."
Penny,"I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?"
Penny,"Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with."
Penny,I know. Thank you.
Penny,It’s just so humiliating.
Penny,"Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car."
Penny,I don’t understand.
Penny,I don’t know what to say.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
Penny,Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
Penny,Disgusting. Do not tell him.
Penny,"Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!"
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
Penny,Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
Penny,"You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun."
Penny,That kind of actress. This sucks.
Penny,"Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?"
Penny,"Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?"
Penny,"Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
Penny,"Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?"
Penny,I’m gonna need another clue.
Penny,"Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great."
Penny,"Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London."
Penny,Hmm.
Penny,"Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me."
Penny,"Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money."
Penny,"So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?"
Penny,Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
Penny,"Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are."
Penny,"In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?"
Penny,You do?
Penny,That’s so sweet.
Penny,"Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?"
Penny,"Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you."
Penny,"Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game."
Penny,Definitely.
Penny,I love it.
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"Yup, we’re all in."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
Penny,"I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks."
Penny,"What is this, my first day?"
Penny,"Yeah, sure."
Penny,I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?
Penny,I’m liking my odds here.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this?  Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?"
Penny,"No, I didn’t get it."
Penny,"I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it."
Penny,I don’t know what to do.
Penny,"Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible."
Penny,"Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?"
Penny,"No, come on. This is serious."
Penny,Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
Penny,She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
Penny,"Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini."
Penny,Both of us.
Penny,"Okay, like what? Show me."
Penny,"Oh, that’s sad."
Penny,Wow.
Penny,Huh?
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Come on, really?"
Penny,"Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it."
Penny,I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
Penny,"Me, either."
Penny,"Yeah, beam me up. I love it."
Penny,That’s what I’m afraid of.
Penny,No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Great. Not like regret at all.
Penny,"Hey, you’re up early."
Penny,I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
Penny,Is something bothering you?
Penny,"Oh, come on, try me."
Penny,"Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it."
Penny,No.
Penny,No.
Penny,"No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want."
Penny,I’m talking about other guys.
Penny,"You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
Penny,"I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow."
Penny,"So, how do you want me to cut it?"
Penny,Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
Penny,Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
Penny,"Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it."
Penny,"Okay, what do you think?"
Penny,Doesn’t it?
Penny,"I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?"
Penny,Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
Penny,Like you could get a brown bear.
Penny,Who’s the duchess?
Penny,"Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you."
Penny,"Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
Penny,And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
Penny,"So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body."
Penny,"But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
Penny,"Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."
Penny,"Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?"
Penny,"Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?"
Penny,"‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it."
Penny,"Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?"
Penny,"Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?"
Penny,I don’t know. What do you want to do?
Penny,What can we do that’s free?
Penny,Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.
Penny,"Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
Penny,No. Bernadette’s working late.
Penny,"Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs."
Penny,Yep.
Penny,What the hell? What? She’s not working late.
Penny,Why would they lie to us?
Penny,You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?
Penny,I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
Penny,"Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon."
Penny,"We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do."
Penny,Shut up.
Penny,What’s wrong?
Penny,It’s fusion.
Penny,Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy."
Penny,"Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these."
Penny,"Come on, open it. I bet it says something great."
Penny,"Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one."
Penny,How is that not good?
Penny,"Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours."
Penny,Not with money. Read.
Penny,"Oh, try again."
Penny,"Oh, I think I see our next stop."
Penny,"No, come on, tonight we are trying new things."
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, just ask your question."
Penny,"Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
Penny,"Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored."
Penny,"Oh, oh, here we go."
Penny,"Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire."
Penny,"Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?"
Penny,"Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness."
Penny,"Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before."
Penny,"What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?"
Penny,"So, when is it?"
Penny,"Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it."
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral."
Penny,"Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?"
Penny,"Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?"
Penny,"No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?"
Penny,"Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now."
Penny,I have a confession to make.
Penny,I’ve never been to a funeral before.
Penny,"I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue."
Penny,"I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone."
Penny,I feel like I want to cry.
Penny,I can’t do it with you staring at me.
Penny,"No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in."
Penny,Toy Story 3?
Penny,It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer."
Penny,You think about dying?
Penny,What would you regret?
Penny,You know Klingon.
Penny,"No, I meant that as a regret."
Penny,What’s that?
Penny,"Well, it just wasn’t the right time."
Penny,And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
Penny,I know that face. That’s your propose face.
Penny,What’s two to one?
Penny,"Oh, my. It’s not a contest."
Penny,Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?"
Penny,"No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up."
Penny,This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?
Penny,No.
Penny,You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Yeah, he is pretty stupid."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Uh, pretty good, actually."
Penny,"Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all."
Penny,Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
Penny,Go away. Just go away.
Penny,What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
Penny,"Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know."
Penny,"I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you."
Penny,"Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better."
Penny,"Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?"
Penny,You can’t do that. He’s with me.
Penny,What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
Penny,"You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
Penny,"Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous."
Penny,"All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous."
Penny,"God, what am I doing with my life?"
Penny,"You were on set, you saw what it was like."
Penny,"Oh, really?"
Penny,It was over a bowling alley.
Penny,Are you done?
Penny,It was for haemorrhoid cream.
Penny,"Leonard, you are really not cheering me up."
Penny,"Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny."
Penny,"Oh, my God. What a day."
Penny,No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
Penny,With my life.
Penny,I don’t know. We could get married.
Penny,I am.
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Penny,"What? No, that’s not what I’m saying."
Penny,"What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you."
Penny,"Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want."
Penny,You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.
Penny,"Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy."
Penny,"You, you stupid Pop-Tart."
Penny,Really? You guess you’re in?
Penny,Okay. Leonard: Cool.
Penny,"Yeah, I think so."
Penny,What’s wrong?
Penny,"Yeah, it kind of does, huh?"
Penny,Where did you get a ring?
Penny,"Oh, my God, yes."
Penny,You’re right! Yay!
Penny,Shut up.
Penny,You want some wine?
Penny,I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
Penny,"Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me."
Penny,Not a chance.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Okay, then, yeah."
Penny,"No, keep your money."
Penny,This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
Penny,"If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?"
Penny,Sorry. I’ll get better.
Penny,"Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule."
Penny,"Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
Penny,"Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
Penny,"Amy, get out."
Penny,"Oh, I’m sure he’s fine."
Penny,How?
Penny,You do that?
Penny,"He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
Penny,What?
Penny,So? He loves trains.
Penny,It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.
Penny,We were worried about you.
Penny,And go where?
Penny,"Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go."
Penny,It might be good for him.
Penny,He’s a grown man.
Penny,"Leonard, we can’t protect him forever."
Penny,"He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan."
Penny,"Seriously, let him go."
Penny,Be safe and call us.
Penny,Mm.
Penny,I really think this is gonna be for the best.
Penny,Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
Penny,"Hey, what’s going on?"
Penny,Oh.
Penny,Is he okay?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"I can’t, I have that job interview."
Penny,"Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back."
Penny,Nope.
Penny,I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.
Penny,I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
Penny,They do?
Penny,"Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head."
Penny,I wish I felt more confident.
Penny,"Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel."
Penny,But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.
Penny,They’re comfortable.
Penny,"Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done."
Penny,People. Yes.
Penny,"Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump."
Penny,People.
Penny,"Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time."
Penny,"Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her."
Penny,"Yeah, kind of."
Penny,"I know, but she’s kind of a bully."
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,What happened?
Penny,"Oh, my God, no."
Penny,"Hey, look who’s back."
Penny,I thought your phone got stolen.
Penny,I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
Penny,Next Monday.
Penny,"Uh, not yet, but I will."
Penny,I said I’ll get to it.
Penny,"Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know."
Penny,"Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?"
Penny,Hey. Ready to go to lunch?
Penny,What happens if you don’t?
Penny,"Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her."
Penny,"Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me."
Penny,That is not true.
Penny,"I told you, they’ll be right out."
Penny,"Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?"
Penny,I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.
Penny,"So, what are you saying?"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me."
Penny,"No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…"
Penny,"Headaches, dizziness and nausea."
Penny,Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
Penny,"Uh, no. I can keep going."
Penny,"Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."
Penny,Hi. What’s going on?
Penny,"Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play."
Penny,For what?
Penny,"What, you? Really?"
Penny,That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
Penny,I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
Penny,"Hey, how was dinner?"
Penny,You guys are going out two nights in a row?
Penny,That’s so hot.
Penny,Aw.
Penny,"Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub."
Penny,Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
Penny,"Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc."
Penny,Relax.
Penny,So what? Why do you even care?
Penny,"Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant."
Penny,A hundred.
Penny,"Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry."
Penny,"Oh, what did those rascals do now?"
Penny,"Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships."
Penny,"No, don’t."
Penny,Just don’t take it.
Penny,‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?
Penny,I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.
Penny,"No, stop being stupid."
Penny,"Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about."
Penny,"That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me."
Penny,It does?
Penny,"Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."
Penny,"Hey, sorry about that."
Penny,Let’s just take the test.
Penny,"Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad."
Penny,Leonard.
Penny,"Look at you, talking sports."
Penny,Can he really throw a ball?
Penny,"Yeah, that’s a no."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist."
Penny,"Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
Penny,I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
Penny,Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
Penny,It’s just this vibe I got.
Penny,"Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much."
Penny,"Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out."
Penny,"Yeah, I hope you’re right."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
Penny,"Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra."
Penny,"So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure."
Penny,"It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive."
Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
Penny,"Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?"
Penny,"What? Oh, why would he say that?"
Penny,"Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,No. Yeah.
Penny,You told Emily we hooked up?
Penny,Why would you say that?
Penny,We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh."
Penny,"I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past."
Penny,Almost everyone has a past.
Penny,It’s not.
Penny,How? You can’t force someone to like you.
Penny,"No, that won’t work."
Penny,What?
Penny,It’s stupid.
Penny,"Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you."
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,Why are you asking me?
Penny,"Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
Penny,Huh.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, thank you for coming."
Penny,"No, no. No need to apologise."
Penny,"Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago."
Penny,"Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us."
Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous."
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"Oh, we would love that."
Penny,"Okay, good night, guys."
Penny,Bye.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
Penny,Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?
Penny,Yes. I’ll check flights.
Penny,"So, where should we go first?"
Penny,Nah.
Penny,No.
Penny,Oh. Okay.
Penny,No.
Penny,"Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere."
Penny,"Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh."
Penny,It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
Penny,"It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days."
Penny,"Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,You guys look like you’re having fun.
Penny,That’s a dollar.
Penny,That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
Penny,"All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman."
Penny,To the walk-in closet? Sure.
Penny,Yep. Shake that thing.
Penny,"Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work."
Penny,Yeah. It’s all very professional.
Penny,"Okay, good."
Penny,"Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?"
Penny,You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
Penny,"I’m sorry, I was thinking about work."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news."
Penny,This is for you.
Penny,"Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one."
Penny,"Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both."
Penny,What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
Penny,"Well, good, because that’s what I did."
Penny,"Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage."
Penny,Why?
Penny,"And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go."
Penny,"Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now."
Penny,"Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight."
Penny,"Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?"
Penny,Hi. Sure.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
Penny,"Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird."
Penny,Mm.
Penny,"You know what, that’s great. I love that."
Penny,You two want to be alone?
Penny,"Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that."
Penny,"Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary."
Penny,Control issues?
Penny,"Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure."
Penny,You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.
Penny,"Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers."
Penny,"Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple."
Penny,"Well, do you guys ever fight over money?"
Penny,I see it.
Penny,"Oh, don’t apologize."
Penny,It really bothers him?
Penny,Uh-oh.
Penny,"Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you."
Penny,Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.
Penny,It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
Penny,Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
Penny,"Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."
Penny,"Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear."
Penny,"Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us."
Penny,Why would you say that?
Penny,I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
Penny,"Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls."
Penny,"No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?"
Penny,Really? Why?
Penny,"Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on."
Penny,Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.
Penny,"Please, yes."
Penny,"What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket."
Penny,"Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?"
Penny,You were okay with that?
Penny,"Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?"
Penny,"Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him."
Penny,"I can’t do it, he’s my best client."
Penny,Dr. Lorvis?
Penny,"So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
Penny,"Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy."
Penny,"Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you."
Penny,"Okay, so how do they unstick it?"
Penny,"Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
Penny,Move it.
Penny,Just walk.
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay?"
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, let’s go."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper."
Penny,"Ah, You guys are the best."
Penny,"Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet."
Penny,"That, believe it or not, is my prom dress."
Penny,What kind of teenager did you think I was?
Penny,The word is popular.
Penny,"Aw, that’s sad."
Penny,Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.
Penny,No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
Penny,"Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
Penny,"Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me."
Penny,"Okay, okay."
Penny,"Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?"
Penny,"Ugh, thanks a lot."
Penny,"Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch."
Penny,You knocked more than usual.
Penny,"Okay, what’s up?"
Penny,"Great, how?"
Penny,"Okay, just one question. What?"
Penny,"Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?"
Penny,"Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always."
Penny,You’re kidding.
Penny,"Thank you, so do you."
Penny,"Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
Penny,"Oh, it’s beautiful."
Penny,"Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom."
Penny,"Well, who’d you go with?"
Penny,Aw.
Penny,"Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance."
Penny,"Well, you don’t know that."
Penny,"What, that already happened?"
Penny,"Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either."
Penny,"Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now."
Penny,I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.
Penny,Thank you for wearing your heels.
Penny,Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
Penny,"I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka."
Penny,"Yeah, back off, he’s all mine."
Penny,Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?
Penny,We had a really nice swim.
Penny,"‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?"
Penny,You had to tell him?
Penny,He’s still in surgery.
Penny,He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.
Penny,I think she meant something a little happier.
Penny,"Oh, it’s nice you got him that."
Penny,"Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time."
Penny,"Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
Penny,Really? You won’t even say A?
Penny,"Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him."
Penny,"Sheldon, it was just a little tremor."
Penny,"Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card."
Penny,"Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny."
Penny,"Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him."
Penny,"Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door."
Penny,"Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back."
Penny,"Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid."
Penny,"Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.
Penny,Come on. She’s not that bad.
Penny,"I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…"
Penny,Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?
Penny,"So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?"
Penny,I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
Penny,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss."
Penny,"Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."
Penny,"Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean."
Penny,"No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing."
Penny,"No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper."
Penny,"Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them."
Penny,You’re doing it again.
Penny,"Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."
Penny,"No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together."
Penny,Even though your dress is ugly.
Penny,What?
Penny,Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
Penny,"Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
Penny,That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
Penny,"Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy."
Penny,Because this company needs you.
Penny,See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
Penny,"Hey, how are things going with your parents?"
Penny,"You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon."
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,"So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?"
Penny,"Oh, that’s rough."
Penny,"Oh, great. Everything’s good."
Penny,"Yes, we did."
Penny,You’re just gonna leave him here?
Penny,"So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?"
Penny,"No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?"
Penny,Like what?
Penny,"Sorry. She’s taken, too."
Penny,"Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?"
Penny,"Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from."
Penny,"Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right."
Penny,It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
Penny,"Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?"
Penny,So erase them and walk out.
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any."
Penny,Of course it is.
Penny,Hi. Ready to go?
Penny,"Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?"
Penny,"Well, did you tell him that?"
Penny,Did you say it out loud with words?
Penny,I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
Penny,"No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted."
Penny,"Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary."
Penny,"Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding."
Penny,"All right, well, what do you want to do?"
Penny,"Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate."
Penny,"Three words, Doctor Who convention."
Penny,You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.
Penny,"You were, but somehow I held myself back."
Penny,Is there any part of your body that’s normal?
Penny,How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
Penny,"All right, keep thinking."
Penny,"It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it."
Penny,"No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston."
Penny,Bye.
Penny,"Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?"
Penny,Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?
Penny,How is it okay?
Penny,"Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want."
Penny,"Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it."
Penny,"Well, you named it."
Penny,How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
Penny,"Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready."
Penny,Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.
Penny,I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.
Penny,"Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada."
Penny,"Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush."
Penny,So what do you need the headphones for?
Penny,Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
Penny,"Yeah, have fun."
Penny,And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
Penny,"I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one."
Penny,"Ugh, what?"
Penny,"Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it."
Penny,"I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder."
Penny,"The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?"
Penny,"Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?"
Penny,"So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii."
Penny,"Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector."
Penny,Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
Penny,Come in.
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,What exactly do you think goes on here?
Penny,"Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about."
Penny,Let’s just talk about our periods.
Penny,Say the quote again.
Penny,"Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Date night.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Now, you just get comfortable."
Penny,"Yeah, you get some sleep."
Penny,"You’re right, we can’t."
Penny,Mmmm.
Penny,"So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?"
Penny,"Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium."
Penny,"And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?"
Penny,Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.
Penny,"No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing."
Penny,"Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving."
Penny,"Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you."
Penny,"Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store."
Penny,"What, no, why?"
Penny,It would be humiliating.
Penny,"Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Okay, we’ve seen plenty."
Penny,"Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more."
Penny,"Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant."
Penny,You look like a talking cupcake.
Penny,How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
Penny,It is; it truly is.
Penny,No.
Penny,Okay. We are reading that right now.
Penny,Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
Penny,"Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon."
Penny,Please show us?
Penny,You know I’m gonna read it either way.
Penny,"Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different."
Penny,"Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
Penny,"“Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”"
Penny,"It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."
Penny,"Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
Penny,"So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state."
Penny,"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."
Penny,"What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens."
Penny,"No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?"
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Get out!
Penny,You want me to stop reading?
Penny,As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
Penny,Hey.
Penny,You okay?
Penny,What’s going on?
Penny,"Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?"
Penny,"Oh, that sounds like a good thing."
Penny,I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.
Penny,"Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
Penny,"All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go."
Penny,"I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?"
Penny,"Well, you could shove them somewhere."
Penny,No.
Penny,"I don’t know, just think about something else."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,"You know, some people try visualization."
Penny,"Okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
Penny,Now imagine you’re holding that pen.
Penny,Now open your hand and let it go.
Penny,"Sheldon, this isn’t that hard."
Penny,How?
Penny,What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.
Penny,Son of a bitch.
Penny,I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
Penny,Why would she even do this?
Penny,Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
Penny,It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.
Penny,"Oh, my, that’s it. Get out."
Penny,Get out.
Penny,What?
Penny,"Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."
Penny,I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
Penny,Open the door now.
Penny,Pull up your pants.
Penny,I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.
Penny,"I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box."
Penny,Unbelievable.
Penny,Really? You couldn’t get it out?
Penny,"Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings."
Penny,The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it.
Penny,I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
Penny,How’s Howard holding up?
Penny,"Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me."
Penny,Don’t take this away from me.
Penny,"Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story."
Penny,"Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?"
Penny,"Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor."
Penny,What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
Penny,"Please, can I do it with him? Please?"
Penny,I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
Penny,"You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want."
Penny,Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.
Penny,What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.
Penny,"Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
Penny,Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
Penny,You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.
Penny,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Penny,"Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
Penny,"Yeah, why?"
Penny,He’s there.
Penny,"Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?"
Penny,"Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy."
Penny,"Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
Penny,"Come on, I’m just having some fun with you."
Penny,"Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys."
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,"Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing."
Penny,You’re all alike.
Penny,Really? You always seem so confident.
Penny,"Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
Penny,"Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you."
Penny,And the wave is gone.
Penny,"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
Penny,Today’s your birthday?
Penny,"Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows."
Penny,"So, why did you finally tell me?"
Penny,"Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone."
Penny,That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
Penny,All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
Penny,You ready?
Penny,And begin. This is kind of creepy.
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
Penny,"Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too."
Penny,I meant more like a little brother.
Penny,It’s getting creepy again.
Penny,Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
Penny,Can you believe it’s been eight years?
Penny,I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
Penny,That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.
Penny,"Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you."
Penny,Like what?
Penny,I just want to make sure you get there safe.
Penny,It really has.
Penny,"Again, it was miniature golf."
Penny,You can’t be this proud.
Penny,Because I beat you.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Aw, is this your first time?"
Penny,"Well, why?"
Penny,You went to the dirty store without me?
Penny,"Well, get it. Get it for me."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?"
Penny,"Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off."
Penny,"No. No, come on, I want to do it."
Penny,"Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you."
Penny,So what do you think?
Penny,"I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?"
Penny,"Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this."
Penny,Almost 1am.
Penny,"Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this."
Penny,How did you get paint in your eye?
Penny,We sure did.
Penny,"Sweetie, I beat you at this, too."
Penny,What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
Penny,And our butts. Not hanging it.
Penny,"Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it."
Penny,"I mean, who even reads Scientific American?"
Penny,"If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"
Penny,I’m sorry. What can I do?
Penny,"No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go."
Penny,I am taking you shopping.
Penny,"My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again."
Penny,"Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?"
Penny,It does have a camera in it.
Penny,"You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow."
Penny,You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
Penny,"Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?"
Penny,And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
Penny,"I know, I know."
Penny,"Wow, it looks really pretty in here."
Penny,"All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?"
Penny,This food is amazing.
Penny,"Oh, so it’s like The View."
Penny,Shut up.
Penny,"Wait, who’s Tor?"
Penny,"Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss."
Penny,Guys.
Penny,"Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon."
Penny,I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
Penny,Shut up.
Penny,"You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon."
Penny,PRK?
Penny,You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
Penny,"Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time."
Penny,"Oh, I meant beer pong."
Penny,So when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?
Penny,"Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones."
Penny,"No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it."
Penny,"Sorry, he’s really good."
Penny,Wow.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"I care. Oh, wait, no, I don’t. Good luck, Raj."
Penny,Whoa.
Penny,It’s in your purse. Play.
Penny,"Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before."
Penny,Those are Star Trek people.
Penny,I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,"Yeah, so, how many people listen?"
Penny,What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
Penny,"I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill."
Penny,"Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you."
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you."
Penny,"Oh, wow. I wish it was better."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Seriously?
Penny,"Oh, my, I would love that."
Penny,"Well, maybe I can do both."
Penny,I don’t think I asked you.
Penny,What is the harm if I audition?
Penny,"I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life."
Penny,Thanks a lot.
Penny,"Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?"
Penny,Decent? I make twice what you make.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out."
Penny,In a safe place.
Penny,"No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks."
Penny,Don’t you have a guy?
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money."
Penny,"Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again."
Penny,"Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?"
Penny, Sheldon.
Penny,"Yeah, I kind of want to do it again."
Penny,"Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you."
Penny,"No, no. It’s about my acting career."
Penny,Well.
Penny,"Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up."
Penny,"Well, why?"
Penny,You’re really not gonna tell me?
Penny,"Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question."
Penny,"If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?"
Penny,No.
Penny,Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
Penny,"Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks."
Penny,I’m sorry. What was I thinking?
Penny,"‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it."
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,"Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."
Penny,"Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes."
Penny,Mmm.
Penny,Yeah. I started that rumour.
Penny,"I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things."
Penny,"I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out."
Penny,"I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it."
Penny,"Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,Okay.
Penny,All right.
Penny,"I, uh, huh."
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes."
Penny,"Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt."
Penny,It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.
Penny,So it’s not really like that?
Penny,You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
Penny,What?
Penny,"Well, can we get on another airline?"
Penny,"So, that’s it? We’re not going?"
Penny,"Well, that sucks."
Penny,Oh. You could tell it to me.
Penny,Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.
Penny,Ooh.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,I got you a little something to cheer you up.
Penny,Just open it.
Penny,Because you are giving your commencement speech.
Penny,I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
Penny,"Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,What’s taking so long?
Penny,"Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown."
Penny,"Oh. Well, you do."
Penny,"Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs."
Penny,Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.
Penny,"Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school."
Penny,"Okay, bye."
Penny,"I’ll, I’ll tell you later."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…"
Penny,"Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?"
Penny,Don’t you want to know for sure?
Penny,"Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it."
Penny,"You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me."
Penny,Really? It didn’t work for you.
Penny,"Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly."
Penny,"Sorry, I forgot."
Penny,"Oh, yes. Hi, Mary."
Penny,"Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring."
Penny,Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
Penny,We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
Penny,"Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are."
Penny,"Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love."
Penny,"Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
Penny,"I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz."
Penny,"Well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"It’s okay, go ahead."
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,"Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables."
Penny,"Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
Penny,Mmm. So what do you need help with?
Penny,Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
Penny,That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?
Penny,And that made her angry?
Penny,"Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her."
Penny,Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?
Penny,"Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night."
Penny,"Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat."
Penny,Thanks for cooking.
Penny,That carrot was delicious.
Penny,Still haven’t heard from her?
Penny,"Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship."
Penny,"Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together."
Penny,"Uh, hello."
Penny,"No. Sheldon, we’re getting married."
Penny,"Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now."
Penny,I’m focusing on my job.
Penny,So busy.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you."
Penny,You know why.
Penny,"Not in a rush, busy with work…"
Penny,Really good.
Penny,"Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?"
Penny,"Well, you want a date, pick a date."
Penny,"Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?"
Penny,I doubt it.
Penny,"All right, well, I want it in a church."
Penny,Fine. I want to release butterflies.
Penny,Sounds perfect.
Penny,Stay out of it.
Penny,"No, it’s okay."
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now."
Penny,Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
Penny,"Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross."
Penny,"Um, I’m free tonight."
Penny,Vegas isn’t that far away.
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Penny,"Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in."
Penny,"Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes."
Penny,Yeah. This is crazy.
Penny,"Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us."
Penny,"And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets."
Penny,And no regrets.
Penny,What?
Penny,What?
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"No, you told me."
Penny,What did you do?
Penny,And then what?
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Nope, never."
Penny,"You know, can I ask you a question?"
Penny,Why are you telling me this now?
Penny,"Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it."
Penny,"No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us."
Penny,"Uh, keep your mouth off other women."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing."
Penny,Just kissing.
Penny,"Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Ha-ha, don’t push it."
Penny,"So, what package are you thinking?"
Penny,Why would we want that?
Penny,Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
Penny,"No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it."
Penny,What’s going on?
Penny,She did?
Penny,"Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married."
Penny,"Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."
Penny,"Amy, don’t be like that."
Penny,"Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special."
Penny,"She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs."
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?"
Penny,What if they call our names?
Penny,"Oh, and the fairy tale continues."
Penny,"Really, we’re good."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,I know.
Penny,"I love you, too."
Penny,"No, thank you."
Penny,No. You wrote vows?
Penny,"Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad."
Penny,"No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this."
Penny,Wow.
Penny,"Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me."
Penny,He loves that movie.
Penny,We did it.
Penny,Can you?
Penny,"Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?"
Penny,Nicely done.
Penny,"Well, the night is still young."
Penny,Yeah. I guess.
Penny,"It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl."
Penny,You’re right. Just forget it.
Penny,Did you feel guilty?
Penny,Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
Penny,"What do you mean, every time you see her?"
Penny,You still see her?
Penny,You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
Penny,"Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?"
Penny,"I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not."
Penny,What’s this?
Penny,Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
Penny,I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
Penny,"You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."
Penny,Some girl named Mandy.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,That’s great.
Penny,That’s ridiculous.
Penny,I’m with Leonard.
Penny,Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
Penny,I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
Penny,"Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,You couldn’t sleep either?
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,"Actually, I think he’s onto something."
Penny,That’s true. You are.
Penny,Can we talk?
Penny,"All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do."
Penny,"Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information."
Penny,"Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?"
Penny,Really? Why is that?
Penny,"No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should."
Penny,"No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on."
Penny,"Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you."
Penny,I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
Penny,What do you think?
Penny,"You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met."
Penny,I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
Penny,"You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now."
Penny,I never thought about it like that.
Penny,"So, you said you had something to tell me."
Penny,Uh-huh.
Penny,I’m listening.
Penny,"Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it."
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you."
Penny,"You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too."
Penny,That sounds nice.
Penny,"Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me."
Penny,"It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard."
Penny,"Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,That’s so great.
Penny,We?
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee."
Penny,"Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement."
Penny,"Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here."
Penny,"We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
Penny,Your glasses?
Penny,Your shoes.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now."
Penny,Why? I can do it right here.
Penny,"No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times."
Penny,"Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity."
Penny,"Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally."
Penny,"Oh, just my parents and my entire family."
Penny,"Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."
Penny,"They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart."
Penny,"Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."
Penny,There you go. You’re all done.
Penny,I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
Penny,"You’re not gonna let this go, are you?"
Penny,"Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?"
Penny,Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
Penny,You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?
Penny,"Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother."
Penny,"Hey, Daddy."
Penny,"Uh, good. Is Mom around?"
Penny,"Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married."
Penny,"Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed."
Penny,Very. Leonard is so great.
Penny,"Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much."
Penny,It is. You’re the best dad ever.
Penny,"Well, what is it?"
Penny,No.
Penny,Moondance?
Penny,You killed my pig?
Penny,When?
Penny,You didn’t tell me for a year?
Penny,"Thanks a lot, guys."
Penny,"Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother."
Penny,No. He was a beloved member of the family.
Penny,It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
Penny,"Phone, now."
Penny,Try dialing.
Penny,"Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you."
Penny,What? What are you doing back?
Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry."
Penny,"If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet."
Penny,My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
Penny,You win.
Penny,"Oh, we’re glad you had fun."
Penny,"Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
Penny,"Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this."
Penny,I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.
Penny,What’s the matter?
Penny,"So, what are you thinking for dinner?"
Penny,"Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want."
Penny,How about Thai food?
Penny,"Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?"
Penny,"Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?"
Penny,Are you doing okay?
Penny,"Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine."
Penny,What else can you do? Move back in with him?
Penny,"Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"
Penny,"Trust me, this is the right thing."
Penny,They’re not saying that.
Penny,"No, no, they’re really not."
Penny,"Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen."
Penny,"Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here."
Penny,Sure.
Penny,"Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog."
Penny,"Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?"
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble."
Penny,"All right, well, what have you tried so far?"
Penny,Really? In a comic book store?
Penny,"Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?"
Penny,"All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous."
Penny,"Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?"
Penny,"Well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
Penny,And sometimes we marry them anyway.
Penny,What?
Penny,I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
Penny,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
Penny,I think she means not a weirdo.
Penny,"All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
Penny,"Oh, good for him."
Penny,"So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?"
Penny,"Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it."
Penny,"Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart."
Penny,Wow. So how many girls have you met?
Penny,"Well, so how does it work?"
Penny,"Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone."
Penny,"Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute."
Penny,And he’s sad about it.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?"
Penny,"Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next."
Penny,"Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish."
Penny,"Look, it’s Stuart."
Penny,"Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull."
Penny,Chug.
Penny,"Amy, you’re getting a text."
Penny,You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
Penny,I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
Penny,Amy.
Penny,"Well, good for you."
Penny,In school?
Penny,Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
Penny,Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
Penny,And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
Penny,"Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better."
Penny,"Yeah, you probably had it coming."
Penny,"Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on."
Penny,"Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch."
Penny,"Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?"
Penny,I would.
Penny,"Oh, what’s that ring box?"
Penny,What?
Penny,"Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?"
Penny,I know. It just…
Penny,I knew I could smell ’em.
Penny,Oh pfft.
Penny,I’m sorry. I’m not here.
Penny,Um.
Penny,"All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human."
Penny,"I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else."
Penny,"Sweetie, you’re yelling."
Penny,I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Definitely.
Penny,Do you know what that means?
Penny,Are you telling the truth?
Penny,What are you gonna do?
Penny,I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
Penny,Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
Penny,"Oh, I don’t want credit for that."
Penny,Oh. Good for you.
Penny,And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
Penny,Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
Penny,"Come on, Amy, show us the dress."
Penny,"Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing."
Penny,No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
Penny,Ooh.
Penny,"Yeah, come on, tell us more."
Penny,"Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone."
Penny,"All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?"
Penny,Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
Penny,We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
Penny,"Damn, you’re sneaky."
Penny,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date."
Penny,"What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?"
Penny,"No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see."
Penny,You’re not curious who she’s out with?
Penny,But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
Penny,"Hey. So, where are they?"
Penny,"Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars."
Penny,"Oh, there he is."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come."
Penny,Fine.
Penny,Your what?
Penny,He really seems into her.
Penny,I had to; we’re married now.
Penny,"What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us."
Penny,"Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?"
Penny,"Oh, no."
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day."
Penny,But we can’t.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
Penny,"Sweetie, you are grown up."
Penny,Yep. What’s the code?
Penny,It’s not working.
Penny,Nope.
Penny,Uh.
Penny,"Yes, I do."
Penny,May.
Penny,I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
Penny,"Well, you don’t know everything about me."
Penny,"Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife."
Penny,Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?
Penny,Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
Penny,Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
Penny,Damn it.
Penny,"Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?"
Penny,Interesting. I never told you that.
Penny,No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
Penny,I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
Penny,How can reading my journal be an accident?
Penny,"Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?"
Penny,All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
Penny,"Okay, really, I’m fine."
Penny,"Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote."
Penny,Does it really say that?
Penny,OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
Penny,Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes."
Penny,Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
Penny,"I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself."
Penny,Public nudity?
Penny,"Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?"
Penny,"Okay, great. What is it?"
Penny,I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
Penny,"Oh, my God, he won’t stop."
Penny,Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?
Penny,Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
Penny,Fine.
Penny,Who cares?
Penny,Problem solved.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems."
Penny,Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
Penny,Do you even like the Beach Boys?
Penny,Why?
Penny,"Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
Penny,"She did soften your life, didn’t she?"
Penny,Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
Penny,I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday."
Penny,You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
Penny,"Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake."
Penny,"Well, find out."
Penny,Come in.
Penny,We’re sorry. What do you need?
Penny,Wow. You can really arrange that?
Penny,Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
Penny,"Okay, well, what’s the third option?"
Penny,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing."
Penny,"Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you."
Penny,"Sheldon, that’s so beautiful."
Penny,"Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?"
Penny,"Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
Penny,"Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought."
Penny,"Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow."
Penny,Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
Penny,I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
Penny,"Have fun, guys."
Penny,"Knowing them, they will."
Penny,I don’t know. He said he’s ready.
Penny,"Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo."
Penny,I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.
Penny,"Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know."
Penny,"Um, a psychiatrist. Why?"
Penny,"Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep."
Penny,That’s interesting.
Penny,"Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on."
Penny,"I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Hey, how’d it go?"
Penny,"Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?"
Penny,You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
Penny,"Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever."
Penny,I guess.
Penny,"And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying."
Penny,"Uh, do you have any questions?"
Penny,Mm-hmm?
Penny,I just meant a question about the drug.
Penny,I don’t wanna.
Penny,"You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point."
Penny,"How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?"
Penny,"You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable."
Penny,"And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon."
Penny,"Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper."
Penny,"I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping."
Penny,"Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage."
Penny,I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
Penny,"Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?"
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man."
Penny,And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
Penny,"Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night."
Penny,"Oh, I love me some Leo."
Penny,You really don’t know why?
Penny,"Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest."
Penny,"Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?"
Penny,"Well, I’m in. When are we going?"
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there."
Penny,Can this wait?
Penny,"Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out."
Penny,Leonard.
Penny,"So, was the fight really bad?"
Penny,No.
Penny,Is she okay?
Penny,And there’s your next T-shirt.
Penny,Here’s some champagne.
Penny,You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
Penny,"If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
Penny,And now you see the problem.
Penny,"Shake it, baby."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,What is that?
Penny,"Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person."
Penny,I park fine.
Penny,"Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?"
Penny,Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you."
Penny,"All right, let’s go."
Penny,"Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding."
Penny,"Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything."
Penny,Come in.
Penny,Uh-oh.
Penny,Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
Penny,Go ahead.
Penny,Say yes.
Penny,"So, you really gonna break up with her?"
Penny,"Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?"
Penny,"All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears."
Penny,"No, I, I really didn’t."
Penny,An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
Penny,So what did you say?
Penny,"All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?"
Penny,Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
Penny,"Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?"
Penny,"This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’."
Penny,"I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him."
Penny,I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
Penny,Hi there. What’s your name?
Penny,"Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?"
Penny,"Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…"
Penny,You don’t have to call me ma’am.
Penny,"I mean, we’re basically the same age."
Penny,How old are you?
Penny,"Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here."
Penny,Because I’m young. Let’s go.
Penny,It is freaking amazing.
Penny,"I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before."
Penny,Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
Penny,"Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?"
Penny,"Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over."
Penny,You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
Penny,Won’t make us any younger.
Penny,"Okay, like what?"
Penny,"Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?"
Penny,"Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff."
Penny,Midnight.
Penny,"Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out."
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Cleaning up is not young and fun.
Penny,"Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, I can’t believe it."
Penny,"Are, are you not happy about this?"
Penny,"No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
Penny,"Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny."
Penny,"Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, we should go out."
Penny,"Uh, I don’t know, a bar?"
Penny,"We can, but all right."
Penny,"Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes."
Penny,"And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor."
Penny,"Oh, tell us."
Penny,"Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it."
Penny,"Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in."
Penny,"Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them."
Penny,What’s it say?
Penny,"Hey, guys. Congratulations."
Penny,"So, you gonna get up there later?"
Penny,That was such a fun night.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box."
Penny,"Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette."
Penny,"Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?"
Penny,"On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
Penny,"W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?"
Penny,"Well, where is he?"
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Penny,"Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?"
Penny,"Oh, poor thing."
Penny,"You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"All right, what about music?"
Penny,No music it is.
Penny,"Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"
Penny,"Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later."
Penny,"You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her."
Penny,"Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?"
Penny,"Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?"
Penny,"I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever."
Penny,"Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it."
Penny,"That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too."
Penny,"My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you."
Penny,"Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much."
Penny,"Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?"
Penny,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak."
Penny,You nailed it.
Penny,"Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug."
Penny,Is that a pregnancy thing?
Penny,But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
Penny,"Oh, sure. Let me see it."
Penny,"Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily."
Penny,"Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?"
Penny,I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
Penny,"Come on, just open it."
Penny,"Well, never hurts to have a spare."
Penny,"See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?"
Penny,"Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?"
Penny,"Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear."
Penny,"I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you."
Penny,Say hi to Emily for us.
Penny,"Sheldon, did you draft the contract?"
Penny,Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
Penny,What?
Penny,"If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Penny,"You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?"
Penny,No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.
Penny,Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?"
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Penny,"Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em."
Penny,"So, how’s it goin’?"
Penny,Is there anything we can do to help?
Penny,"Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then."
Penny,"Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny."
Penny,Like this?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
Penny,"Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story."
Penny,"Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."
Penny,"Okay, so what is solder?"
Penny,"I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
Penny,"Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things."
Penny,You were home alone and had no one to play with?
Penny,I think we’re good.
Penny,Why?
Penny,Un-freakin’ believable.
Penny,No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?"
Penny,"Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?"
Penny,"Yeah, that’s pretty good."
Penny,"Okay, here they come."
Penny,"Hey, what’s this?"
Penny,"Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype."
Penny,"Yeah, it’s fine."
Penny,And he’s back in the closet.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,What am I smelling?
Penny,That’s not what the forest smells like.
Penny,"Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?"
Penny,"You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me."
Penny,She.
Penny,But I could get her.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,I’ll see if it’s available.
Penny,Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
Penny,"Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?"
Penny,I can see that. What team did you get?
Penny,"Well, we’ll be in the woods."
Penny,"Nice hat, Sheldon."
Penny,It’s so cute and rustic up here.
Penny,This place is great.
Penny,"Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought."
Penny,This sucks.
Penny,"You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us."
Penny,No.
Penny,"Hey, let’s light a fire."
Penny,Got it.
Penny,"Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?"
Penny,"Not the drinking game, a drinking game."
Penny,"All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink."
Penny,"Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…"
Penny,"Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back."
Penny,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Penny,"What, he arrested you for that?"
Penny,And then you got arrested.
Penny,How?
Penny,"Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals."
Penny,"Yeah, go ahead."
Penny,I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
Penny,We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
Penny,How long have you had this secret account?
Penny,"Well, how much you got in there?"
Penny,"My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?"
Penny,What good is it if you don’t use it?
Penny,"Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too."
Penny,I hate my job.
Penny,"Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while."
Penny,Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
Penny,"Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?"
Penny,"Well, it’s not what I want to do."
Penny,"Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through."
Penny,I guess.
Penny,"I love you, too."
Penny,"Well, guess I gotta drink."
Penny,What is the problem?
Penny,"Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?"
Penny,"Well, why are you fighting him on this?"
Penny,"Well, I will still come to your meeting."
Penny,"Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
Penny,"Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead."
Penny,"Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting."
Penny,"If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went."
Penny,You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
Penny,Really? The only adult?
Penny,"All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night."
Penny,"Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting."
Penny,"Don’t worry, he’ll come around."
Penny,You don’t know?
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here."
Penny,"Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here."
Penny,"Yeah, come on, Raj."
Penny,May I take your cloak?
Penny,What’s up?
Penny,Where’d you get that from?
Penny,"Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?"
Penny,I don’t always defend Sheldon.
Penny,What about your weird relationship with him?
Penny,"Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident."
Penny,There you go.
Penny,Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
Penny,"Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go."
Penny,The little choo-choo for toddlers?
Penny,"Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on."
Penny,"Hey, you ready to go?"
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,You actually smell the wine?
Penny,Are your sinuses acting up?
Penny,"Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?"
Penny,"Oh, good for you."
Penny,"No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it."
Penny,"Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye."
Penny,You guys been here long?
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,"Uh, I don’t know."
Penny,"Ah, there’s definitely some oak."
Penny,"Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack."
Penny,We did.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."
Penny,"Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do."
Penny,We didn’t.
Penny,Helium.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,Yes. Pi.
Penny,More specific.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Sure.
Penny,No problem.
Penny,You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
Penny,Or a way for you to avoid her?
Penny,"Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up."
Penny,"Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Or as I know him?
Penny,"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
Penny,"Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?"
Penny,"Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs."
Penny,"Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?"
Penny,"Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?"
Penny,Uncomfortable.
Penny,"Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"
Penny,"Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine."
Penny,"You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?"
Penny,"You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges."
Penny,"Um, it has seat warmers."
Penny,How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
Penny,"Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere."
Penny,"What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face."
Penny,You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
Penny,"Okay, good example."
Penny,"To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
Penny,It was spur of the moment.
Penny,"Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?"
Penny,You really think we made a mistake?
Penny,"Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested."
Penny,She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
Penny,"Hi, how was the screening?"
Penny,"Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month."
Penny,"Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place."
Penny,"Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug."
Penny,"No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."
Penny,"Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family."
Penny,"Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one."
Penny,"Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?"
Penny,"Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families."
Penny,"Thanks to overcrowding, yeah."
Penny,"Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce."
Penny,"Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you."
Penny,"Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."
Penny,No.
Penny,I don’t see how I could.
Penny,I was kind of hoping you would.
Penny,"Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?"
Penny,"Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?"
Penny,"Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship."
Penny,"Whew, chilly."
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,Alfred. Thank you for coming!
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
Penny,"No, of course not."
Penny,"You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?"
Penny,"Oh, maybe. Get closer."
Penny,"Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way."
Penny,"Oh, so follow him."
Penny,"Well, go faster. You’re losing him."
Penny,"You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"So, what did we miss?"
Penny,"Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them."
Penny,"Oh, thanks for asking until I did."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,"Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that."
Penny,‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
Penny,Really? ‘Cause I love it.
Penny,Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
Penny,"God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
Penny,"Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic."
Penny,"Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb."
Penny,"What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now."
Penny,Why?
Penny,"Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. "
Penny,"Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin."
Penny,"Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you."
Penny,"Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part."
Penny,What?
Penny,"Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…"
Penny,"So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California."
Penny,"All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
Penny,I thought it was really funny.
Penny,"Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
Penny,Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
Penny,"Well, I learned from the best."
Penny,Aw.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
Penny,"Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Oh, thanks, Mom."
Penny,Is he? I never noticed.
Penny,"All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds."
Penny,"You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk."
Penny,"Well, for a while. Then he comes back."
Penny,No. You told me not to.
Penny,Would they really do that?
Penny,How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
Penny,"Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
Penny,I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
Penny,"Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her."
Penny,Is that really what’s important right now?
Penny,"That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill."
Penny,Great.
Penny,"In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?"
Penny,"Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?"
Penny,"Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
Penny,"Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
Penny,"Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows."
Penny,"Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied."
Penny,"Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,What are you doing?
Penny,Does he even like lemon bars?
Penny,Something happen at the meeting?
Penny,And you talked?
Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too."
Penny,Why would that make me feel better?
Penny,Okay. Never mind.
Penny,"Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know."
Penny,"Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible."
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Penny,"Yeah, come on in."
Penny,"Oh, thank you, and I’m sorry I lied about it. "
Penny,"Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?"
Penny,You threatened to sue?
Penny,That’s funny. I learned something totally different.
Penny,"Oh, that’s so beautiful."
Penny,Good morning.
Penny,"Oh, I’ll go. I like a party."
Penny,"It’s okay, I’ll still go."
Penny,"Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?"
Penny,Hi.
Penny,How early are we?
Penny,I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
Penny,So should we talk to each other or mingle?
Penny,"Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party."
Penny,"Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you."
Penny,"Wait, what do you mean she’s her?"
Penny,No.
Penny,"What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?"
Penny,Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?
Penny,You trend setter.
Penny,"Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard."
Penny,Leonard Hofstadter.
Penny,"That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down."
Penny,"You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school."
Penny,"Wow, you popular girls are mean."
Penny,"Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?"
Penny,"Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?"
Penny,"Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
Penny,"Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
Penny,"No, not at all."
Penny,I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
Penny,"Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall."
Penny,"Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that."
Penny,Don’t be proud of that.
Penny,"Well, where would you go?"
Penny,"Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
Penny,"Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
Penny,"You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy."
Penny,Mm. 
Penny,"That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?"
Penny,"Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
Penny,"I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key. "
Penny,"Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."
Penny,"You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
Penny,"Well, here’s your key."
Penny,"Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional."
Penny,"Yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
Penny,Good night.
Penny,Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
Penny,"So, what do you want to do?"
Penny,"Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?"
Penny,Ugh. Can we just have sex?
Penny,"Inevitable, you say?"
Penny,"Wow, where did you learn these moves?"
Penny,I told you not to do the worm.
Penny,"Yeah, get it, girl."
Penny,Even more not what you think.
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Was that a science diss?
Penny,Was it a good one?
Penny,Oh.
Penny,I feel like I should say damn.
Penny,Damn. 
Penny,The new neighbours are weird.
Penny,"Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?"
Penny,Can’t.
Penny,Didn’t.
Penny,"Believe me, we know what you’re going through."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,She’s right. That’s reasonable.
Penny,"Yeah. You tell him, babe."
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you say to that?"
Penny,"I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas."
Penny,"All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
Penny,So it’s okay for you to joke around?
Penny,Just as challenging?
Penny,As you?
Penny,Just as challenging as you?
Penny,"Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal."
Penny,"Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world."
Penny,"You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey."
Penny,Agreed. Thank you.
Penny,"You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
Penny,Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
Penny,"Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream."
Penny,"Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
Penny,You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.
Penny,"Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite."
Penny,What about the girl behind the counter?
Penny,Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
Penny,All right.
Penny,Not relating. Go on.
Penny,"Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay."
Penny,"Oh, that’s awful."
Penny,"Well, what happened with your dad?"
Penny,You poor thing.
Penny,And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
Penny,"Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."
Penny,"Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?"
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
Penny,We’re back.
Penny,We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
Penny,Do you want him back?
Penny,"Call me crazy, but I found it moving."
Penny,"Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?"
Penny,I got asked to sign autographs there.
Penny,"Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on."
Penny,It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
Penny,"You just said yourself, it’s sad."
Penny,I don’t know.
Penny,I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,What’s all this?
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
Penny,Who’s that?
Penny,"Oh, there’s so much I want to change."
Penny,Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
Penny,"Alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
Penny,"Hey, that guy’s looking over here. "
Penny,I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi. 
Penny,"Well, thanks."
Penny,Your love confuses me. 
Penny,Okay. Who do I make it out to?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,That did not clear things up.
Penny,What’s your name?
Penny,Okay.
Penny,Been hearing that a lot today.
Penny,"Yep, there they are."
Penny,Here you go. 
Penny,"Well, go ahead. He’s right over there."
Penny,Hello.
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows."
Penny,"Oh, sure."
Penny,Leonard…
Penny,"Yeah, he really is."
Penny,And he started to slowly wear me down.
Penny,"Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards."
Penny,I think it’s hot.
Penny,"You know, once, I proposed to him."
Penny,"Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
Penny,"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?"
Penny,"Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready."
Penny,"Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon."
Penny,"So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?"
Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Penny,Wet wall?
Penny,Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
Penny,"Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
Penny,But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
Penny,"Oh, don’t worry, I won’t."
Penny,The woman at the wall store?
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while."
Penny,"I did, still a mess."
Penny,Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
Penny,"Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble. "
Penny,Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
Penny,"Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love."
Penny,What? Tha… That is not true.
Penny,"Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow."
Penny,"Uh, did you notice your key chain?"
Penny,Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
Penny,And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
Penny,Ubamy bube cubool.
Penny,That’s a great idea.
Penny,"Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours."
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Okay, but you may feel some discomfort."
Penny,Do you really mean that?
Penny,"Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff."
Penny,That candle and you.
Penny,"Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle."
Penny,We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
Penny,Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
Penny,I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
Penny,"Oh, that means so much. I love you."
Penny,"You’re dating somebody, who is it?"
Penny,You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
Penny,"All right, fine, don’t tell us."
Penny,All right.
Penny,Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?
Penny,"Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common."
Penny,How come you never eat broccoli?
Penny,"Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?"
Penny,Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
Penny,"Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here."
Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some."
Penny,"So, were you turned on even a little bit?"
Penny,"Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny."
Penny,"You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?"
Penny,It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
Penny,"I, I knew the answer. I got excited."
Penny,"Well, and what happened to you?"
Penny,"This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off."
Penny,"I do, your life is fine you big baby. "
Penny,There you go.
Penny,There you go.
Penny,"Aw, thank you."
Penny,What?
Penny,"You liked my short hair, right?"
Penny,"Seriously, none of you liked it?"
Penny,"You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?"
Penny,I think I hate all of you nerds.
Penny,I can’t believe you punched Bert.
Penny,"Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."
Penny,"Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away."
Penny,Amy wants me to have it.
Penny,But it’s a picture of you.
Penny,But you commissioned it.
Penny,But you like it so much.
Penny,I seem to be losing.
Penny,Why don’t you keep it?
Penny,"Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with."
Penny,So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,Leonard.
Penny,"Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets."
Penny,Are you sure?
Penny,What a jerk.
Penny,"Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that."
Penny,"I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
Penny,"What, what are you doing in our apartment?"
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this is over the line."
Penny,What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
Penny,"Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive."
Penny,"We’re good, thank you."
Penny,Little lower to the left. A little more.
Penny,"No, still hideous."
Penny,"Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
Penny,"Sheldon, what took you so long?"
Penny,"Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?"
Penny,"Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while."
Penny,"Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now."
Penny,"Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun."
Penny,We could go to a bar.
Penny,"Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!"
Penny,"I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?"
Penny,"All right, well, you two go have fun."
Penny,"Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
Penny,"Well, I didn’t until I heard that."
Penny,"Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away."
Penny,"Hey, Bernadette’s water broke."
Penny,Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
Penny,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
Penny,"Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress."
Penny,"You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room."
Penny,Anyone else want to try?
Penny,"Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
Penny,Here.
Penny,Oh! 
Penny,Does the baby have a name yet?
Penny,– Oh.
Penny,"Oh, look at all the babies."
Penny,"Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette."
Penny,"Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
Penny,"Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore."
Penny,Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
Penny,"Well, you’re home now."
Penny,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
Penny,"So, what happened in Texas that was so bad? "
Penny,Do boys have flowers?
Penny,Mm.
Penny,"Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad."
Penny,What?
Penny,That’s too loud.
Penny,Hi. There’s the little family!
Penny,Mm.
Penny,Yeah. Go ahead.
Penny,"Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas."
Penny,"Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
Penny,Okay. Then what happened?
Penny,"So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?"
Penny,"Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight."
Penny,"To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree."
Penny,You do make a cute elf.
Penny,"Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree."
Penny,"No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go."
Penny,"Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens."
Penny,"Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit."
Penny,Fine.
Penny,Leonard?
Penny,There’s something on the windshield.
Penny,You need a break?
Penny,There’s no shame in asking for a break.
Penny,Ugh. Leonard?
Penny,There’s a tree on you.
Penny,"Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure."
Penny,You poor things you must be exhausted.
Penny,So things started to turn around?
Penny,I can’t believe you fit in the crib.
Penny,Our pleasure.
Penny,"What, what’s all this?"
Penny,"Oh, that is so thoughtful."
Penny,"Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it."
Penny,"Oh. Hey, what smells so good?"
Penny,Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
Penny,"Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this."
Penny,You did not just quote an Nsync song.
Penny,Oh. 
Penny,I hadn’t really thought about it.
Penny,"Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
Penny,"Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants."
Penny,"Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more. "
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh, it was fine."
Penny,"Uh, chips."
Penny,Some wine.
Penny,Hm. At least he took an interest. 
Penny,Nothing.
Penny,I don’t want to talk about it.
Penny,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
Penny,"It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
Penny,This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
Penny,"All right, we’re heading out."
Penny,Thanks. Are you ready?
Penny,Let’s go.
Penny,When was the last time you got a massage?
Penny,"Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade."
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Penny,What are you doing here?
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself."
Penny,All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
Penny,I’m trying to figure it out.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,We’re not getting divorced.
Penny,"Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um."
Penny,Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance. 
Penny,"Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
Penny,I think this all looks good.
Penny,"Hey, boys. How’s it going?"
Penny,"No. No, you don’t, you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough."
Penny,"Wow, I find that hard to believe."
Penny,I take it back. I believe it.
Penny,"Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks."
Penny,My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.
Penny,"Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs."
Penny,"I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
Penny,"You don’t have a problem with this, do you?"
Penny,"Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm."
Penny,"Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
Penny,"He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
Penny,"No, it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here."
Penny,What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?
Penny,"Leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
Penny,He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.
Penny,Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
Penny,"If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?"
Penny,"Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
Penny,He would get his own place.
Penny,Yes.
Penny,"It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?"
Penny,You gave me a bill at the end of every month. 
Penny,"Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
Penny,"Yes, we’re fine."
Penny,"Hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
Penny,"He won’t be mad at me. I mean, you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come, so…"
Penny,"Oh, I’m gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal."
Penny,"So, did you wind up sending that machine back?"
Penny,"So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."
Penny,I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Penny,"All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing."
Penny,"Okay, that’s the one to beat."
Penny,All right. You guys ready to get crazy?
Penny,"You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks."
Penny,No. She’s busy. You call Howard.
Penny,"Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun."
Penny,"Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?"
Penny,"Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those."
Penny,Is everything okay?
Penny,Maybe we should just call it a night.
Penny,I’m just not really in the mood anymore.
Penny,I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
Penny,"Okay, maybe I’m the one who’s sad."
Penny,Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby. 
Penny,"No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings."
Penny,"Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race."
Penny,"I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
Penny,"Yeah, I guess I am making decent money. "
Penny,"Oh, that’s gonna make me cry."
Penny,Ew.
Penny,What is happening?
Penny,"Aw, look at you watching sports."
Penny,"Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
Penny,"Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?"
Penny,"You know, we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here."
Penny,"Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
Penny,"Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci."
Penny,That must’ve been expensive.
Penny,"And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel."
Penny,"Wait, Leonard, he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels."
Penny,"Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight."
Penny,"All right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
Penny,"Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself."
Penny,"All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?"
Penny,You don’t how much your rent is?
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,"Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em."
Penny,"Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
Penny,"Okay, only if you’re sure. Whew."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
Penny,"Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?"
Penny,"Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look."
Penny,"Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?"
Penny,"Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along."
Penny,"So, do you want to come?"
Penny,Please? I went to your boring thing last month.
Penny,"Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
Penny,"It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it."
Penny,"Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
Penny,"Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
Penny,"Well, you and I would get our own room, right?"
Penny,"Well, it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
Penny,"You know, it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days."
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Penny,"I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside."
Penny,"You know, maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
Penny,Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?
Penny,"Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?"
Penny,"This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go."
Penny,Why? Do you not want me to go?
Penny,"Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Hey, babe, you want to drive?"
Penny,"No, it’s fine, I know you don’t like the way I drive."
Penny,"Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me."
Penny,Just say you want to drive.
Penny,"Amy, do us a favour, please drive."
Penny,"It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it."
Penny,You’re the one who seems upset.
Penny,"Wait, you don’t want me to go?"
Penny,I just thought it would make you happy.
Penny,"Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go."
Penny,Okay.
Penny,"Hey, if you’re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket."
Penny,"Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet."
Penny,Really?
Penny,"Ooh, how about white-water rafting?"
Penny,What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
Penny,You’re a good friend.
Penny,You’re an even better husband.
Penny,"Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
Penny,What’s it for?
Penny,"Yeah, it’s yours."
Penny,"She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal."
Penny,"Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
Penny,Mm-hmm.
Penny,"Raj, you don’t have to serve us."
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."
Penny,You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon.
Penny,"So, relax. We’re happy to have you."
Penny,Do you actually pay for that haircut?
Penny,What are you talking about? We’re fine.
Penny,"Yeah, this is a special circumstance."
Penny,"Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special."
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Penny,Now you’re taking her side?
Penny,Morning.
Penny,What? Why?
Penny,I feel terrible.
Penny,"Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
Penny,"All right, so we’ll ask him to come back."
Penny,Don’t you want to get dressed first?
Penny,We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you.
Penny,More reasons for you to stay.
Penny,Then it’s settled.
Penny,"Oh, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?"
Penny,"Yeah, I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
Penny,"Oh, right, sorry."
Penny,"If you want, I can get ready in five minutes."
Penny,"Yeah, bye, sweetie."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard."
Penny,"No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick."
Penny,Paul.
Penny,"Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy."
Penny,"I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does."
Penny,"Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games."
Penny,Mm.
Penny,"Okay, how is that?"
Penny,"Well, this is a moisturizing mask."
Penny,"Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night."
Penny,"Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
Penny,"Ooh, yes. Fun."
Penny,I probably should have spit out my gum first.
Penny,"Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?"
Penny,"Yeah, that’s rude."
Penny,"Well, sweetie, that’s crazy."
Penny,"Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
Penny,"Yeah, you’re right. You know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,What?
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work."
Penny,"Oh, are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
Penny,"Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
Penny,Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.
Penny,"Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?"
Penny,"You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that.  You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say"
Penny,"Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day."
Penny,Are you getting sick?
Penny,"Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard."
Penny,"All right. Well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen."
Penny,You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
Penny,It’s nine o’clock. 
Penny,"I don’t know, check your body for tattoos?"
Penny,"Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?"
Penny,"Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere."
Penny,The notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
Penny,"Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
Penny,"Oh, that, that’s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?"
Penny,"I don’t even run there, I drive."
Penny,"Oh, wait. I remember."
Penny,Yes. Please find someone who cares.
Penny,"Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life."
Penny,So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group.
Penny,", Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?"
Penny,"Oh, is that offer for everybody?"
Penny,"Aw, that’s so weird."
Penny,"You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
Penny,The end.
Penny,I think it’s Bert.
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money."
Penny,"Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?"
Penny,All that and he’s shorter than me.
Penny,I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.
Penny,Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?
Penny,"Oh, Zack. Hey."
Penny,"Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?"
Penny,"Well, congratulations."
Penny,"No, on, on getting engaged, good for you."
Penny,"Yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he’s not even here."
Penny,"Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard."
Penny,"Hey, you ready to go?"
Penny,What’s the matter?
Penny,"What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it."
Penny,"Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
Penny,"Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2."
Penny,"Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?"
Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Penny,"Uh, it’s okay, I’m still in pharmaceutical sales."
Penny,"Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it."
Penny,"Oh, that’s a nice offer."
Penny,"Right, ’cause it spells menu."
Penny,"See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check."
Penny,"Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
Penny,"You work with Sheldon, you tell me."
Penny,"Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?"
Penny,"Great, so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?"
Penny,You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.
Penny,"So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure."
Penny,And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
Penny,"What, you wouldn’t trust him?"
Penny,"Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
Penny,‘Cause he’s scared of you?
Penny,Yeah.
Penny,Hey.
Penny,You want to talk?
Penny,"Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now."
Penny,"Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable. "
Penny,Then what do we do?
Penny,"No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now."
Penny,"You don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
Penny,"Okay, are you sure about this?"
Penny,"Hey, uh, so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job."
Penny,"Oh, so there’s no job?"
Penny,"Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?"
Penny,"Champagne, champagne."
Penny,"And for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice."
Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
Penny,"Um, well, I, yeah, you got me."
Penny,And when? But also where?
Penny,"Okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay, that’s cool."
Penny,Good for you. 
Penny,"Oh, come on, he’s a grown man, he can take care of himself."
Penny,"Once again, you got me."
Penny,"Oh, hey, what’s going on?"
Penny,What?
Penny,Amy’s got some news.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long."
Penny,"Oh, stop it, he’ll be fine."
Penny,"I mean, I like a little brown sugar."
Penny,Sorry.
Penny,"Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one."
Penny,"Well, what’s wrong with that?"
Penny,And yet you bore his child. Neato.
Penny,"Okay, a simple yes will do."
Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical."
Penny,A lot of lectures?
Penny,"Oh, we would love that."
Penny,"I want to, but I don’t think I can."
Penny,"Okay, I’m good now."
Penny,"Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh."
Penny,Did he Purell?
Penny,I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.
Penny,I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.
Penny,Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?
Penny,"All right, then we agree. He’s not making any moves, it’s this Dr. Ramona chick."
Penny,Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.
Penny,We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
Penny,"No. Come on, it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen."
Penny,"Well, what do you want us to do?"
Penny,Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.
Penny,Thanks. I was scrambling.
Penny,Do you really think there’s reason to worry?
Penny,"All right, well, that doesn’t prove anything."
Penny,The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
Penny,"So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?"
Penny,"Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
Penny,"You got fingers and a mouth, you call her."
Penny,"All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there."
Penny,Will you go with me?
Penny,Sure.
Penny,We’ll all go.
Penny,"Pardon. I just need to., yeah."
Penny,We need to talk.
Penny,"Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."
Penny,"Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."
Penny,"Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
Penny,"Well, then you get it."
Penny,Right.
Penny,"Let’s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe…"
Penny,All right. What do you think is happening?
Penny,"Don’t look at me like that, I tried."
Penny,"So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?"
Penny,Hey guys.
Penny,Son of a Bitch!
Penny,"You sick, geeky bastards!"
Penny,Leonard!
Penny,You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
Penny,What?
Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
Penny,"Hi, hey. I’m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?"
Penny,"Oh, hey Sheldon, what’s going on?"
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,"Oh, hey guys. "
Penny,"Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!"
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Penny,"Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? "
Penny,"Okay, I have a problem."
Penny,"Oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
Penny,"Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. "
Penny,Hi guys.
Penny,Hey guys. 
Penny,"Leonard, ready to go?"
Penny,"Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”"
Penny,Let’s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. 
Penny,Hi guys.
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty…"
Penny,Little ball of fur. 
Penny,"Here you go, good luck, bye."
Penny,"Oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
Penny,"Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it’s just going “aaaaaaa”."
Penny,"Okay, new contest. "
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,"Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee."
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,What the hell’s going on? 
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. "
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute, I w…."
Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
Penny,"Um, that one. "
Penny,"Yeah, well so do I, look you’ve got to stall Leonard a little longer."
Penny,Him.
Penny,I need to use your window.
Penny,"I’m fine, Leonard, just go away."
Penny,Sheldon.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Thanks. 
Penny,Hi guys.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.
Penny,"No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger."
Penny,"Okay, goodnight."
Penny,"Oh, sonofabitch!"
Penny,Hi!
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want."
Penny,"Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly."
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Penny,"Sheldon, what is it?"
Penny,Get out.
Penny,"Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?"
Penny,"Hey, guys, I need to use your TV."
Penny,"Hey, guys, what’d I miss? What’d I miss?"
Penny,"Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard."
Penny,"Okay, where is he?"
Penny,"Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?"
Penny,"Leonard, congratulations."
Penny,Out of coffee. Need coffee.
Penny,Sheldon?
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?"
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh, good morning."
Penny,"I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word."
Penny,Shh! Act normal.
Penny,"Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
Penny,"Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?"
Penny,"Oh, hey, guys."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,Hello?
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Penny,"Oh’ my God, she didn’t!"
Penny,Freaky.
Penny,"Yeah, freaky."
Penny,"Hi, guys. Hi, honey."
Penny,Why doesn’t he just get another job?
Penny,"Oh, God, how did he know?"
Penny,Leonard!
Penny,Sheldon help!
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?"
Penny,Hi. Sorry I’m late.
Penny,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la."
Penny,Oh.
Penny,"Darn tootin’, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase."
Penny,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally.
Penny,"Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving."
Penny,Who is it?
Penny,Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What’s that?
Penny,Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Penny,What now?
Penny,"Ah, it’s okay."
Penny,Would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
Penny,"Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky."
Penny,"Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?"
Penny,You laughed.
Penny,"Oh, good. Hey."
Penny,We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
Penny,"Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?"
Penny,"Mrs. Cooper, hey, it’s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother."
Penny,Who can’t go out with Leonard?
Penny,Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
Penny,"All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send"
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?"
Penny,Damn.
Penny,"I don’t think so, Mom. Not today."
Penny,You don’t know the half of it.
Penny,Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
Penny,Sittin’ pretty.
Penny,"Yeah, sure!"
Penny,Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
Penny,What do you think?
Penny,Give me a minute.
Penny,"Oh, sorry."
Penny,"So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
Penny,Who do we love?
Penny,Who do we love?
Penny,Who do we love?
Penny,"Yeah, I heard you. I got red."
Penny,You should probably drive.
Penny,Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Penny,"Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?"
Penny,"Oh, good, your power’s out, too."
Penny,What the hell?!
Penny,Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
Penny,"Thanks, Cole. See you at school."
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Yeah, everybody’s happy, great."
Penny,"Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty."
Penny,"Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL."
Penny,"No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap."
Penny,How could Red Hulk be worthy?
Penny,"You doing okay, sweetie?"
Penny,"Oh, my God!"
Penny,"…when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That’s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded."
Penny,"Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape."
Penny,Leonard! Hi!
Penny,Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
Penny,Hurry.
Penny,It was not funny.
Penny,What is wrong with you?
Penny,"You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
Penny,"No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye."
Penny,"Oh my God, I do look like that."
Penny,"No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?"
Penny,Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
Penny,Ugh!
Penny,Ugh!
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty."
Penny,"Happy kitty, sleepy kitty."
Penny,"Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla."
Penny,"Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist."
Penny,"Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?"
Penny,Hi.
Penny,Hi.
Penny,"Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border."
Penny,Leonard says you’re pregnant.
Penny,"Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’."
Penny,Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
Penny,"Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat."
Penny,"Wa-how, we did it."
Penny,"Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby."
Penny,Hey.
Penny,"Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."
Penny,Do you really think that’s funny?
Penny,"So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?"
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy."
Penny,"You love her very much, don’t you?"
Penny,"Yeah, sure, why not?"
Raj,"You mean, you don’t."
Raj,"Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite."
Sheldon,"Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper."
Sheldon,"I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner."
Raj,It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.
Raj,Why?
Raj,Smooth.
Raj,Are there any chopsticks?
Raj,"Also, the pretty girl left."
Raj,"Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee."
Raj,"Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me."
Raj,"intoxicating, isn’t it?"
Raj,Oooh.
Raj,"Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!"
Raj,I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
Raj,"Oooh, he’s got me."
Raj,He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
Raj,What’s the matter.
Raj,Like who?
Raj,You might be bound by them right now.
Raj,"Also, Sheldon may be a robot. "
Raj,You could power down.
Raj,"Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America."
Raj,"Of course, but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me."
Raj,Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
Raj,"Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. "
Raj,Oh dear.
Raj,She didn’t take my order.
Raj,"Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. "
Raj,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. 
Raj,"Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball."
Raj,Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
Raj,"Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. "
Raj,"What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect. "
Raj,"Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man. "
Raj,"Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix. "
Raj,"Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s."
Raj,What is your move?
Raj,"Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. "
Raj,"Oh, that’s very impressive. And a little racist. "
Raj,"We can split it two, two and two."
Raj,"Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from. "
Raj,What do you suppose she meant by that?
Raj,We could cut it into thirds. 
Raj,That works. 
Raj,"Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here. "
Raj,Uurgh.
Raj,How about soup?
Raj,What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart. 
Raj,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
Raj,I can’t see him.
Raj,I’m all out. 
Raj,There are no rules in hell! 
Raj,"All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo. "
Raj,What?
Raj,And this is Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment. 
Raj,"May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali. "
Raj,Sorry papa.
Raj,And over here is Sheldon.
Raj,He lives with Leonard. 
Raj,"No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer."
Raj,"Papa, please don’t start. "
Raj,"Okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
Raj,What is it papa.
Raj,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
Raj,Why did you do that?
Raj,"But Papa, I’m not supposed…"
Raj,Spring wedding?
Raj,"If you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
Raj,Why are you telling me about my own culture? 
Raj,"Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can’t go through…"
Raj,I don’t believe it.
Raj,"Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?"
Raj,What?
Raj,"Okay, I know what I’m going to do."
Raj,Find new friends. 
Raj,"I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this."
Raj,Can you believe how pushy she is?
Raj,"If I don’t call her, I won’t hear the end of it from my parents."
Raj,"How can I call her, you know I can’t talk to women. "
Raj,Why?
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character? "
Raj,I didn’t want to make this one.
Raj,"Great, then we’ll get married, I won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. "
Raj,"Where did my life go, Penny? One day I’m a carefree batchelor, and the next I’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi. "
Raj,"Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course. "
Raj,"Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam. "
Raj,And it’s about to tell my parents that I’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta. 
Raj,"Haven’t you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women."
Raj,"You’re right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?"
Raj,"Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle. "
Raj,Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
Raj,Okay.
Raj,I can’t believe I’m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta. 
Raj,"Little Lalita. That’s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it."
Raj,"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?"
Raj,Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat? 
Raj,"So you’re a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning. "
Raj,"Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more! "
Raj,"But you’re a dentist, he’s nuts. "
Raj,Back off Sheldon. 
Raj,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
Raj,You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
Raj,"Oh, screw Princess Punchali."
Raj,But you’re not Princess Punchali.
Raj,What just happened?
Raj,"Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa. "
Raj,"But he’s right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything! "
Raj,"Go ahead, tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren."
Raj,This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
Raj,Yes Mommy.
Raj,"Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did."
Raj,Sorry? That’s all you can say is sorry?
Raj,I’m not an alcoholic.
Raj,"It was just this one time, Papa, I swear. "
Raj,"But Papa, please…."
Raj,Please wait until I get into the hall. 
Raj,Go for stereo. 
Raj,I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped. 
Raj,I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. 
Raj,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.” 
Raj,Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. 
Raj,Why not? 
Raj,"Oh, too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach. "
Raj,Sounds fun.
Raj,Shotgun.
Raj,"Well I’d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ."
Raj,You did what you had to do. 
Raj,"Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. "
Raj,"Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston. "
Raj,How about Lasic? 
Raj,"Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
Raj,The living room appears to be empty. 
Raj,"No way, Jose. "
Raj,The… the picture’s breaking up. 
Raj,Go away. 
Raj,"Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. "
Raj,"As it turns out, yes."
Raj,"Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?"
Raj,We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. 
Raj,She was sleeping with you?
Raj,It’s possible she may have misunderstood us. 
Raj,"Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. "
Raj,Thank you. 
Raj,We need a social catalyst.
Raj,Okay. How about that one.
Raj,Are you crying?
Raj,"Okay, uh, how about her? "
Raj,"Okay, so not her either. How about her?"
Raj,"I can’t talk to her, you do it. "
Raj,"You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done."
Raj,"Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
Raj,"You started it, dude. "
Raj,Unbelievable.
Raj,"Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
Raj,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting. 
Raj,"Hey, look at that.  It’s Dennis Kim."
Raj,"You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. "
Raj,I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception. 
Raj,"How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. "
Raj,Good story.  
Raj,Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
Raj,I like it.
Raj,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
Raj,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. 
Raj,"He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. "
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Raj,"You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. "
Raj,How about the girl from the Wonder Years? 
Raj,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney? 
Raj,"Yeah. Sack up, dude. "
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
Raj,"Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect."
Raj,Holy crap. 
Raj,What did they give you?
Raj,"Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it’s rough. "
Raj,It’s only $800?
Raj,Fifteen seconds.
Raj,"Ten, nine, eight…"
Raj,Five.
Raj,Four.
Raj,Three.
Raj,Two.
Raj,One.
Raj,"Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
Raj,A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?
Raj,Did the listing actually say miniature?
Raj,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
Raj,Sheldon?
Raj,"If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one. "
Raj,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. 
Raj,"Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!"
Raj,He’s got a point.
Raj,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. 
Raj,Twice a month.
Raj,"Okay, every other month."
Raj,"Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena. "
Raj,"Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock. "
Raj,"Ooh, how far into the future?"
Raj,My turn.
Raj,My turn! 
Raj,Why?
Raj,"I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony. "
Raj,"Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
Raj,"Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. "
Raj,"More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer? "
Raj,"Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."
Raj,"Too bad, I called dibs."
Raj,"I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia."
Raj,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? 
Raj,"I’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees. "
Raj,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
Raj,"Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let’s talk."
Raj,"Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man. "
Raj,"We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here? "
Raj,"Yes, I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects. "
Raj,"So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India? "
Raj,"Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man."
Raj,A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. 
Raj,Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra? 
Raj,"The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
Raj,"Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
Raj,We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.
Raj,"Why should I back off, you back off dude."
Raj,"Hey, look at me, I don’t have a foreskin. "
Raj,"I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman! "
Raj,"I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling. "
Raj,"Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here. "
Raj,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte. 
Raj,"She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. "
Raj,Don’t start with me dude.
Raj,Thank you. I apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
Raj,"Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay, it’s a stalemate. "
Raj,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise! 
Raj,"Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don’t know where you are dude, but it’s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh…  Oh look, there’s a girl taking her shirt off. "
Raj,"Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker."
Raj,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. 
Raj,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
Raj,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. 
Raj,He’s coming. Screen saver. 
Raj,"Dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
Raj,You being the fish.
Raj,"They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing. "
Raj,"Nice close up, by the way. "
Raj,"And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there. "
Raj,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. 
Raj,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
Raj,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
Raj,Did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
Raj,"Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? "
Raj,"Well, we all knew this day was coming. "
Raj,"Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. "
Raj,I hate trains. 
Raj,"Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. "
Raj,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. 
Raj,What? 
Raj,Not until now. 
Raj,"Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…"
Raj,Terrific. 
Raj,"Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress."
Raj,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
Raj,Tag. You’re it.  
Raj,"By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?"
Raj,Who were you respecting then?
Raj,Doesn’t count.
Raj,"What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con."
Raj,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
Raj,"H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on."
Raj,What about Leslie Winkle.
Raj,Why?
Raj,I think she’s smoking hot.
Raj,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
Raj,"I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!"
Raj,"Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s."
Raj,Sure.
Raj,"Okay, we’re all set."
Raj,It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
Raj,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
Raj,Hey guys.
Raj,"Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back."
Raj,She’s so considerate.
Raj,Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
Raj,"Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch."
Raj,Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
Raj,"It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno."
Raj,"Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars."
Raj,It’s a lease.
Raj,Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
Raj,The people from People.
Raj,"Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap."
Raj,"Hey guys, what’s up?"
Raj,"It’s very nice of you, I would like that."
Raj,Dr Gablehouser.
Raj,"Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body."
Raj,"Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble."
Raj,"I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger."
Raj,I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
Raj,"Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. "
Raj,"So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?"
Raj,"It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."
Raj,"Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh."
Raj,"Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him."
Raj,"Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me."
Raj,"Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables."
Raj,"Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited."
Raj,"Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps."
Raj,"Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?"
Raj,"Oh, okay, Leonard?"
Raj,Sheldon?
Raj,"Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday."
Raj,Would you like to go with me?
Raj,Really? Cool.
Raj,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
Raj,"Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine."
Raj,"I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?"
Raj,"It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready."
Raj,That’s what you’re wearing.
Raj,"Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous."
Raj,"Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh."
Raj,Dude.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs."
Raj,It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
Raj,It has more food too.
Raj,Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
Raj,"No, wait, the evening’s not over."
Raj,"No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face."
Raj,"Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny."
Raj,"Here you go, cute huh?"
Raj,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
Raj,"Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up."
Raj,Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
Raj,Over what?
Raj,I’m taking you home.
Raj,I have a better idea.
Raj,I like comic books.
Raj,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
Raj,But you finished your experiment a week ago.
Raj,"I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air."
Raj,Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
Raj,"Damn, there’s always a catch."
Raj,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
Raj,"You might want to slow down a bit, buddy."
Raj,Hold on a second. Kreplach?
Raj,"That isn’t Klingon, it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling."
Raj,Judge’s ruling?
Raj,"Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment."
Raj,"There’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame."
Raj,Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
Raj,"Or possibly Durham, North Carolina."
Raj,"Party with the pretty girls, dude!"
Raj,And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
Raj,Are you sure?
Raj,"Oh, pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house."
Raj,What do we do now?
Raj,I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
Raj,Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
Raj,"I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?"
Raj,What?
Raj,"Okay, I think I got it. "
Raj,What are negs?
Raj,I saw what you did there.
Raj,"Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I."
Raj,Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
Raj,Star Trek V!
Raj,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
Raj,"Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding."
Raj,"You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years."
Raj,"Oh, snap."
Raj,What’s Plan B?
Raj,"Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?"
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling."
Raj,You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
Raj,During which she defected to North Korea.
Raj,For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
Raj,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
Raj,"Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet."
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,Can I see your stitches?
Raj,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
Raj,"Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before."
Raj,Of course not. Look at her.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"It’s got a big bird on it, dude."
Raj,"You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around."
Raj,"It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."
Raj,"Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth."
Raj,Booya.
Raj,"“Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man."
Raj,Then how?
Raj,I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
Raj,In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron."
Raj,"Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68."
Raj,"Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude."
Raj,"Sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear."
Raj,She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
Raj,"As with my father, I both love and fear it."
Raj,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
Raj,"Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball."
Raj,"Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
Raj,"How about “Die, toaster, die”?"
Raj,What’s going on?
Raj,"I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity."
Raj,"Oh, snap."
Raj,What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
Raj,He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
Raj,"I’m curious, what part of America is that accent from?"
Raj,I can’t watch anymore.
Raj,"Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile."
Raj,"Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?"
Raj,"But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
Raj,"That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation."
Raj,"Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude."
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, you got this."
Raj,"Go, Monte! Go Monte!"
Raj,"No one’s arguing with you, dude."
Raj,"Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."
Raj,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
Raj,Feel better now?
Raj,"Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results."
Raj,"Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob."
Raj,Fo’ shizzle.
Raj,"I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?"
Raj,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
Raj,Stu the cockatoo?
Raj,He almost made it to the top this time.
Raj,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
Raj,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
Raj,We could eat after the movie.
Raj,"Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
Raj,That’s how we missed it.
Raj,"Yep, I don’t see any way around it."
Raj,"Later, dude."
Raj,Leviticus 11:3: “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
Raj,We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
Raj,"Oh, cool, I got a sword."
Raj,Here.
Raj,"Plus, no one stole their pants."
Raj,I should’ve peed before we left.
Raj,A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
Raj,"If anybody cares, I still have to pee."
Raj,"Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family."
Raj,"Nope, I think mocking you is more fun."
Raj,"Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?"
Raj,"It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week."
Raj,I didn’t bring it up. You did.
Raj,"You always say that, but we never do."
Raj,"God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
Raj,"Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed."
Raj,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
Raj,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
Raj,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
Raj,What was all that about?
Raj,You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
Raj,"And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
Raj,"Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town."
Raj,"Whatever it is, I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong."
Raj,What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
Raj,"It’s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan."
Raj,Holy crap! Look!
Raj,"Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger."
Raj,Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
Raj,"No, you didn’t. I did."
Raj,"You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty."
Raj,"Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
Raj,"Yeah-yeah, which way?"
Raj,Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
Raj,It’s loosely based on my life.
Raj,"And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus."
Raj,"Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space."
Raj,"You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he’s one of those geeks."
Raj,"Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot."
Raj,You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
Raj,Yes?
Raj,What am I looking at?
Raj,Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
Raj,Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
Raj,"Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?"
Raj,Go. 
Raj,What’s the matter?
Raj,"You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India."
Raj,We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
Raj,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
Raj,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
Raj,"I like green lantern, I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow."
Raj,"Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?"
Raj,I could go for some goat.
Raj,We went to the comic book store last night.
Raj,So what are we going to do tonight?
Raj,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
Raj,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches."
Raj,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
Raj,Also a good plan.
Raj,"You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!"
Raj,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
Raj,"Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?"
Raj,"May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
Raj,Why?
Raj,Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
Raj,"Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali."
Raj,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
Raj,Barkeep! Alexander me.
Raj,"Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?"
Raj,Interesting. Are you a Droid?
Raj,Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
Raj,C3PO.
Raj,Are you Spock?
Raj,Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
Raj,"What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?"
Raj,"Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!"
Raj,Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
Raj,"What do you say, Howard?"
Raj,What are you going to tell your mother?
Raj,"Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas."
Raj,But she did dump you.
Raj,"Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
Raj,Sounds like a plan.
Raj,"I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth."
Raj,Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Raj,"Hello, Michaela."
Raj,"Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren’t Ramayan."
Raj,"Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."
Raj,"Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy."
Raj,What? No. ..
Raj,Maybe I can save her.
Raj,"It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours."
Raj,"Oh, I miss her already."
Raj,Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
Raj,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
Raj,"It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up."
Raj,Hello again.
Raj,If you’re really a prostitute.
Raj,With sex.
Raj,How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
Raj,Prostitute.
Raj,"Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience."
Raj,A little baby.
Raj,"A prostitute, yes."
Raj,You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
Raj,"Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet."
Raj,"He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two."
Raj,Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
Raj,Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
Raj,He can’t figure out how to fix it.
Raj,"I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny."
Raj,Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
Raj,"Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty."
Raj,"Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude."
Raj,"It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
Raj,"Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?"
Raj,What if we reposition the collection tank?
Raj,"If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte."
Raj,"Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"
Raj,"That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
Raj,"Me, too."
Raj,"Wow, that’s heavy."
Raj,What do you think the problem is?
Raj,We could play outside.
Raj,"Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?"
Raj,"Ooh, I don’t like where this is going."
Raj,Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
Raj,"But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."
Raj,You still might get on a magazine.
Raj,"Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"
Raj,"Me, too."
Raj,Where are your tools?
Raj,I think I swallowed some paint!
Raj,Me either.
Raj,"If you were standing behind me nagging, I might."
Raj,"No, it’s not. Howard, tell them."
Raj,What are you working on?
Raj,He’s right.
Raj,"So, who’s up for a movie?"
Raj,I say double feature.
Raj,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
Raj,"Yeah, it was first come, first served."
Raj,Thanks.
Raj,We have to tell him.
Raj,It’s not about that.
Raj,"For me, it was a bonding moment."
Raj,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Raj,"He just went colon, capital O."
Raj,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
Raj,I like the new look.
Raj,"I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?"
Raj,I feel bad for the guy.
Raj,"Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
Raj,"Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
Raj,"I’m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?"
Raj,"Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas."
Raj,I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
Raj,To what? Toy Story?
Raj,"Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person."
Raj,"Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
Raj,"Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
Raj,"Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?"
Raj,"Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine."
Raj,"Oh, yeah."
Raj,Disappointed? Let down?
Raj,That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
Raj,"Yeah, you…"
Raj,"Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t."
Raj,What’s that?
Raj,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
Raj,"Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
Raj,Chickens can’t climb trees
Raj,"Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
Raj,I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
Raj,Hallway. 
Raj,"My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?"
Raj,"Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
Raj,Be careful.
Raj,"Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
Raj,What would you name him?
Raj,"Oh, I really don’t care anymore"
Raj,What happened?
Raj,Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don’t do that!
Raj,"Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out."
Raj,Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
Raj,I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
Raj,Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
Raj,I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
Raj,"Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
Raj,"No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now."
Raj,"Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
Raj,"Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys."
Raj,"Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?"
Raj,Raj.
Raj,"Yes, very nice."
Raj,Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
Raj,Goth food.
Raj,Uh… blackened salmon?
Raj,"Oh, we’re scientists."
Raj,"Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
Raj,That sounds really cool.
Raj,So what do you gals do?
Raj,"Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
Raj,"Sure, we like fun."
Raj,Dark and fun.
Raj,In my fanny pack.
Raj,Are you happy now?
Raj,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
Raj,What is your mother going to say?
Raj,"With my luck, hepatitis"
Raj,We’re both frauds.
Raj,But I was summing up.
Raj,"Very, very smart guys."
Raj,"When we tell this story, let’s end it differently."
Raj,"I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
Raj,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
Raj,"Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle."
Raj,"And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
Raj,I’m sorry. Go on.
Raj,But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
Raj,"Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?"
Raj,But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
Raj,Wow. What a great night.
Raj,"Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
Raj,I wonder how they smell.
Raj,Sorry. I lost my cool.
Raj,"Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
Raj,"So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."
Raj,"You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
Raj,"I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere."
Raj,"Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,"
Raj,Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
Raj,Hello Sheldon.
Raj,I’m sad.
Raj,What are you eating?
Raj,"Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all."
Raj,We believe cows are gods.
Raj,"Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!"
Raj,"Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!"
Raj,I’m on it.
Raj,"No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
Raj,"It’s a little early, isn’t it?"
Raj,"That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan."
Raj,"Thank you, sir. "
Raj,"Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
Raj,"Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?"
Raj,"You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
Raj,"That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service."
Raj,Will you come visit me in India?
Raj,Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
Raj,No.
Raj,You want me to work with you?
Raj,"Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
Raj,Shall I wait?
Raj,I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
Raj,"Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
Raj,Wha… You’re kidding!
Raj,All right.
Raj,"Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years."
Raj,"Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg."
Raj,"Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke."
Raj,"Sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
Raj,"All right, let’s buckle down and work."
Raj,Sheldon.
Raj,I need an aspirin.
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
Raj,I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
Raj,"Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt."
Raj,"Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!"
Raj,"My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca."
Raj,It means doo-doo.
Raj,Aha! So I am working with you.
Raj,"Ah, well, in this context… "
Raj,Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
Raj,Let me finish.
Raj,"I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it."
Raj,No.
Raj,Come and get it.
Raj,You are not my superior.
Raj,"Oh, yeah? Can you do this? "
Raj,I’m busy.
Raj,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Raj,So you were wrong.
Raj,That’s the only logical inference.
Raj,For you or with you?
Raj,"All right, but I have some conditions."
Raj,I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
Raj,How did you get here?
Raj,So walk home.
Raj,All right. 
Raj,Nobody can.
Raj,"Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?"
Raj,"Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?"
Raj,Damn.
Raj,"It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing."
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?"
Raj,Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
Raj,"Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable."
Raj,What about the money?
Raj,But this is other money.
Raj,Half of it will be mine.
Raj,"Leonard, help."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?"
Raj,"Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here."
Raj,"Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here."
Raj,"Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here."
Raj,"Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here."
Raj,"No doubt, sign here."
Raj,"Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon."
Raj,"Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!"
Raj,"You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters."
Raj,"Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship."
Raj,"Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame."
Raj,Lava serpent.
Raj,"Problem, Wil Wheaton?"
Raj,"Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!"
Raj,"What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!"
Raj,Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
Raj,No! Not enchanted bunny!
Raj,Kites ho!
Raj,"Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites."
Raj,"Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…"
Raj,See what?
Raj,"No, she didn’t."
Raj,"Come on, scissors, scissors!"
Raj,"Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!"
Raj,Son of a bitch.
Raj,"You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend."
Raj,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
Raj,"Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy."
Raj,"You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with."
Raj,"With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?"
Raj,"Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
Raj,"I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."
Raj,"I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?"
Raj,"It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them."
Raj,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
Raj,It’s open.
Raj,What do you want?
Raj,"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty."
Raj,"Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
Raj,"You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
Raj,"And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there."
Raj,And where were you?
Raj,You’re impossible.
Raj,"Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche."
Raj,"No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you."
Raj,I don’t know.
Raj,I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
Raj,"Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?"
Raj,I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
Raj,I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
Raj,Fine. Go ahead.
Raj,"If you want to chase after her, chase after her."
Raj,Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
Raj,"Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
Raj,"Actually, in this case, I think she was."
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,What a douche.
Raj,"Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."
Raj,"Well, that was rather unpleasant."
Raj,"Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”"
Raj,You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
Raj,"Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset."
Raj,"Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!"
Raj,Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
Raj,"Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy."
Raj,You brought your mother into this!
Raj,"Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset."
Raj,"Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding."
Raj,I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
Raj,I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
Raj,"Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding."
Raj,"Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
Raj,We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
Raj,Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
Raj,"Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
Raj,"Yes, it’s not the same without him. "
Raj,"Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus."
Raj,Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
Raj,"Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control."
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,"So, what are we waiting for?"
Raj,Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.
Raj,"Yeah, thank you. Mmmm."
Raj,"Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers."
Raj,Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
Raj,"That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it."
Raj,"The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path."
Raj,"Okay, how’s that?"
Raj,"It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
Raj,"If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king."
Raj,I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
Raj,"One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
Raj,Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
Raj,"I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
Raj,"Oh, I’m so hungry!"
Raj,He’s right.
Raj,"Me, too. But what? "
Raj,"…And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin."
Raj,Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
Raj,"Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
Raj,"I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “Fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means: “Fever 104, home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier in Hindi."
Raj,"In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
Raj,I thought it was funny.
Raj,You laughed.
Raj,"You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away."
Raj,"I don’t think that’s possible, dude."
Raj,"I didn’t come to help, I came to mock."
Raj,"That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply."
Raj,What’s this?
Raj,Foamy vengeance.
Raj,"Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor."
Raj,Here comes Kripke!
Raj,I believe that’s the president of the university.
Raj,"Well, how could you not put in an abort?"
Raj,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
Raj,"Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?"
Raj,"Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
Raj,"And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive."
Raj,"What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart."
Raj,"Well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
Raj,"Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
Raj,We do?
Raj,I don’t want to do that.
Raj,What about me?
Raj,"Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot."
Raj,Race riots?
Raj,"Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
Raj,No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
Raj,"Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good."
Raj,"I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff."
Raj,"Oh, boy."
Raj,I don’t want to go to Flatland.
Raj,Oy.
Raj,"Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone."
Raj,What?
Raj,Thanks for coming with me.
Raj,Did you really have to bring it in with you?
Raj,"Come on, let’s get a drink."
Raj,"Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw."
Raj,"Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream."
Raj,He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
Raj,"Okay, let’s check out the females."
Raj,"That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old."
Raj,No. I’m looking for a hookup.
Raj,"Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks."
Raj,You help me run my game.
Raj,How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
Raj,The mysterious subcontinent of India.
Raj,You know India?
Raj,"Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,What was that?
Raj,"जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?"
Raj,I don’t get it. You had a great time.
Raj,"Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha."
Raj,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
Raj,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
Raj,You can’t wear the hands on the date.
Raj,"Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now."
Raj,"No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?"
Raj,So?
Raj,"Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?"
Raj,"No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
Raj,There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
Raj,There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
Raj,Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
Raj,"No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com."
Raj,"But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie."
Raj,"Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
Raj,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
Raj,How long can he keep this up?
Raj,He never went back to the university?
Raj,Sheesh.
Raj,But he’s afraid of dogs.
Raj,I’m on a cloud. Swing me. 
Raj,"Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?"
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,Me.
Raj,"Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
Raj,"Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny."
Raj,It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
Raj,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
Raj,"No way, dude!"
Raj,Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
Raj,"Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
Raj,I know. I saw the Tweet.
Raj,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
Raj,No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
Raj,What the hell is that?
Raj,"You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day."
Raj,"No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
Raj,"Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever."
Raj,But I never will.
Raj,What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
Raj,Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! 
Raj,"That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well."
Raj,"Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision."
Raj,I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
Raj,"Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr."
Raj,You called it.
Raj,"Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee."
Raj,"Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model."
Raj,"Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors…"
Raj,"And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom."
Raj,And an Aquaman action figure.
Raj,Huh? That’ll come off.
Raj,It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
Raj,One Ring to find them.
Raj,"Holy crap, are we nerdy."
Raj,"Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
Raj,"No, that’s okay. I’ll get it."
Raj,Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
Raj,Is it Eddie Crispo?
Raj,Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
Raj,Name one.
Raj,"Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?"
Raj,Your guy Eddie Crispo?
Raj,"Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."
Raj,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
Raj,There are no Jewish hobbits.
Raj,"Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski."
Raj,"Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
Raj,I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.
Raj,Also my cousin.
Raj,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
Raj,You’re useless.
Raj,I’m signing off now.
Raj,It’s all of ours. 
Raj,Sure. Let go of the ring.
Raj,"Wait, my laptop. "
Raj,"There are six seasons, dude."
Raj,"No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride."
Raj,"Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae."
Raj,"No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!"
Raj,"Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!"
Raj,"I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies."
Raj,"If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies."
Raj,Why don’t we go after your mother?
Raj,You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
Raj,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
Raj,"Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty."
Raj,What?
Raj,"It’s, it’s not working, dude."
Raj,Then let go of the ring and go.
Raj,"Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…"
Raj,Three.
Raj,The fires of Mount Doom?
Raj,"Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner."
Raj,"Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
Raj,"So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
Raj,"My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron."
Raj,"Well, good for him."
Raj,No.
Raj,"Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking."
Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears."
Raj,"True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes."
Raj,What?
Raj,I’m not going to punch you.
Raj,Do you want to do this or not?
Raj,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
Raj,"Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis."
Raj,Whatever you like.
Raj,Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
Raj,"Then, put on a sweater."
Raj,"Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater."
Raj,You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
Raj,"All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square."
Raj,What now?
Raj,Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
Raj,"Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile."
Raj,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
Raj,"Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do."
Raj,Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
Raj,"Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
Raj,Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
Raj,"Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
Raj,"I’m just asking, dude. It happens."
Raj,Did you start waxing?
Raj,"Yeah, I think we’re getting close."
Raj,"Oh, that would be a good way to go."
Raj,"Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah."
Raj,"Ah, the premature I love you."
Raj,"I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered."
Raj,"Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black."
Raj,Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
Raj,"Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again."
Raj,"Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman."
Raj,"What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?"
Raj,I’ve missed you.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard?"
Raj,I haven’t had sex in a year.
Raj,"Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman."
Raj,"Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser."
Raj,"Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch."
Raj,All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
Raj,Doesn’t have to be Asian.
Raj,"No, I won’t."
Raj,You really think so?
Raj,"But we’ll have sex first, right?"
Raj,Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
Raj,You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
Raj,There are no solar flares right now.
Raj,"Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it."
Raj,I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
Raj,"Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
Raj,What?
Raj,I’m sorry?
Raj,No.
Raj,I don’t put pepper on salads.
Raj,"Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself."
Raj,"Guys, help me."
Raj,The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
Raj,Holy crap!  Holy crap!
Raj,When can I sit with you again?
Raj,I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
Raj,"Relax, it’s Nyquil."
Raj,"Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
Raj,"Did you get a cold, too?"
Raj,She won’t notice they’re missing?
Raj,"Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
Raj,Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
Raj,It is if you love her and give her a name.
Raj,Hi.
Raj,I’m a big fan of your work.
Raj,What?
Raj,I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
Raj,I’m not hungry.
Raj,I bought a parrot.
Raj,"Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend."
Raj,Why didn’t you say anything?
Raj,"Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!"
Raj,Good?
Raj,"Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this? "
Raj,"Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
Raj,"Run. Run, run, run. Don’t look back."
Raj,"It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy."
Raj,Why don’t you ask her to come up?
Raj,"Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong."
Raj,"I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
Raj,What?
Raj,"That’s disgusting, dude."
Raj,You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
Raj,"No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife."
Raj,"Okay, we’ll call that plan B."
Raj,Holy crap.
Raj,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
Raj,The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
Raj,"Yeah, look. Breasts and everything."
Raj,Since when?
Raj,Do you know what he’s talking about?
Raj,"Leonard, what are you talking about?"
Raj,That was a lousy suggestion.
Raj,Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
Raj,"Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her."
Raj,Really? Us gonna tell him?
Raj,Hi.
Raj,"Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
Raj,"But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler."
Raj,"Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum."
Raj,"Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years."
Raj,"Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
Raj,Are you willing to risk it?
Raj,You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
Raj,Smooth.
Raj,Whoo-hoo!
Raj,And it only took 28 minutes.
Raj,"You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman."
Raj,Where does he poop?
Raj,"What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
Raj,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
Raj,Penis first?
Raj,"Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone."
Raj,"A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."
Raj,"All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"
Raj,"Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch."
Raj,"Next time, take your own advice."
Raj,Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
Raj,That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
Raj,"Oh, sure."
Raj,I’m a lamb.
Raj,"That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes."
Raj,Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
Raj,"Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty."
Raj,It’s a potty. What do you call it?
Raj,"That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?"
Raj,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
Raj,If I don’t have to boom-boom.
Raj,"Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?"
Raj,Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
Raj,"Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it."
Raj,"I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
Raj,"Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills."
Raj,"Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
Raj,"Oh, God, never again."
Raj,I was homesick.
Raj,That’s very offensive.
Raj,What does hit a reef mean?
Raj,Pardon?
Raj,Ah.
Raj,You’re kidding.
Raj,He takes the kitty to the potty?
Raj,"Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am."
Raj,Hi.
Raj,"I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
Raj,"Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance."
Raj,Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
Raj,It’s one of his best moves.
Raj,You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
Raj,You have a desk.
Raj,But I can’t have one.
Raj,"Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
Raj,"Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?"
Raj,Yes?
Raj,And I can put it in your office?
Raj,You said I could buy a desk.
Raj,"Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?"
Raj,Can you say it again for me?
Raj,One more time?
Raj,Now three times fast?
Raj,"That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out."
Raj,No.
Raj,No.
Raj,No.
Raj,"I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day."
Raj,Knock yourself out.
Raj,No.
Raj,No.
Raj,No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
Raj,"Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Raj,No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
Raj,"It’s not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
Raj,"Well, we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."
Raj,This is not over.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good."
Raj,"Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me."
Raj,That’s what she said.
Raj,"Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?"
Raj,"Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free."
Raj,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
Raj,"Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya."
Raj,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
Raj,"Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister."
Raj,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
Raj,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
Raj,"Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about."
Raj,Did you pinky swear?
Raj,Okay then.
Raj,"Oh, not really, just hang out."
Raj,Train day?
Raj,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
Raj,"Uh, my plans with Priya."
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him."
Raj,"Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?"
Raj,On Caprica night?
Raj,What were you doing with Priya?
Raj,What? You slept with my sister?
Raj,"Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!"
Raj,"I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
Raj,How hard did she stomp?
Raj,"Okay, I’m good."
Raj,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
Raj,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
Raj,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
Raj,"Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
Raj,"As long as we’re apologising, Sheldon, I, I’m sorry I used your toothbrush."
Raj,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"Oh, yeah? What’s that look like?"
Raj,Where are we going?
Raj,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don’t want to speak to the FBI."
Raj,I’m brown and I talk funny.
Raj,"It doesn’t matter. They’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it’s not offensive."
Raj,Nobody cares. Do you know how long it’s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
Raj,"Oh, Bella, don’t you see? Edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you.  Coming."
Raj,Seven years.
Raj,"I’m in this country legally, you know."
Raj,"Of course not. I’m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I’m not."
Raj,"No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search."
Raj,"Please don’t send me back to India, it’s so crowded. It’s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy."
Raj,"I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I’m a real Yankee Doodle boy!"
Raj,"My country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It’s really great."
Raj,"Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her."
Raj,I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
Raj,"Ah, me, too."
Raj,"I think he’s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York."
Raj,"Oh, yeah."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,What’s in the bag?
Raj,"Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him."
Raj,I haven’t cried like this since Toy Story 3.
Raj,Eight for 28.
Raj,"Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli."
Raj,"You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–"
Raj,"Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats."
Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in."
Raj,"We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it."
Raj,Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
Raj,You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
Raj,"Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!"
Raj,You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
Raj,Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
Raj,We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
Raj,Is that racist? It feels racist.
Raj,"Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly."
Raj,What… what kind of a kiss?
Raj,"Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh."
Raj,Miss.
Raj,Not if it has a hole in the middle.
Raj,A Romulan battle bagel?
Raj,"Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here."
Raj,How do you know that?
Raj,"Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"
Raj,Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
Raj,I do appreciate that.
Raj,"Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."
Raj,Yeah. Like his haircut material.
Raj,No. I got them all cut.
Raj,"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."
Raj,"He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!"
Raj,"Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!"
Raj,"Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion."
Raj,"It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you."
Raj,"No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set."
Raj,"Oh, what’s the point of everything?"
Raj,You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
Raj,"Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me."
Raj,Where?
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop."
Raj,Why? You writing a book?
Raj,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
Raj,Hey.
Raj,He never touched my telescope.
Raj,I did shut up. Now you shut up.
Raj,Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
Raj,"Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"
Raj,We’re good.
Raj,"Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies."
Raj,Did he get superpowers?
Raj,"Oh. Well, that’s disappointing."
Raj,"Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero."
Raj,"Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy."
Raj,"You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?"
Raj,Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
Raj,"Yeah, Leonard, who?"
Raj,"Oh, hey."
Raj,"I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do."
Raj,"Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…"
Raj,What the heck is this?
Raj,Are you crazy?
Raj,No. But it’s a stupid test.
Raj,"Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"
Raj,"All right, I will."
Raj,It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
Raj,Wait. What the hell is ding?
Raj,I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
Raj,"I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?"
Raj,"Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?"
Raj,"No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket."
Raj,"What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights."
Raj,"Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…"
Raj,Don’t yell at me!
Raj,"Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar."
Raj,"No, uh-uh, you’re going down!"
Raj,You realize you can’t win.
Raj,You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
Raj,Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
Raj,"You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips."
Raj,Water Demon.
Raj,What the hell did I do?
Raj,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
Raj,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
Raj,A Milk Dud?
Raj,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
Raj,No.
Raj,The Archies are over here.
Raj,But I’m Green Lantern.
Raj,I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
Raj,"I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks."
Raj,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
Raj,Stupid Aquaman.
Raj,"Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight."
Raj,"Ooh, I call Kermit."
Raj,"Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies."
Raj,"That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?"
Raj,You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
Raj,Where would you go?
Raj,"You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."
Raj,"No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?"
Raj,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
Raj,"Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist."
Raj,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
Raj,Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
Raj,So it spells Sheldon?
Raj,"Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?"
Raj,World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
Raj,What are you talking about?
Raj,"Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together."
Raj,No. The moment has passed.
Raj,"You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?"
Raj,"Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta."
Raj,What do you think we should sell it for?
Raj,"Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going."
Raj,"I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty."
Raj,"Oh, my God, I’m crying already."
Raj,Why?
Raj,Okay. Come on in.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key."
Raj,"Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass."
Raj,What did I do?
Raj,I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
Raj,I’d like to weigh in here. No.
Raj,"Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account."
Raj,"Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine."
Raj,"Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle."
Raj,You really think so?
Raj,"Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander."
Raj,What?
Raj,"Dude, that’s incredible!"
Raj,"Aw, I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?"
Raj,What kind of needs?
Raj,I say okey-dokey.
Raj,Just that I’m definitely not gay.
Raj,Uh-huh.
Raj,What happened?
Raj,"Oh, no!"
Raj,"It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.  It’s Howard. Howard, hello."
Raj,"Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?"
Raj,"No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right."
Raj,"Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…"
Raj,"Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him."
Raj,"Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."
Raj,What?
Raj,"Oh, right. Good one."
Raj,"Here’s what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death, they’re already dead."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, so, zombies."
Raj,"Hey, don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter."
Raj,Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
Raj,Sounds great!
Raj,"Oh, you don’t want that."
Raj,"Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!"
Raj,Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
Raj,"No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants."
Raj,"More than we can use. You see, in India, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."
Raj,I think we were misled about the cute girls.
Raj,Do him first.
Raj,It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
Raj,"Oh, don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?"
Raj,"Cool, buddy! That’s awesome!"
Raj,You can’t come in.
Raj,I forbid it.
Raj,You heard me. I forbidded it.
Raj,Forbaded it?
Raj,"Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike."
Raj,No!
Raj,"It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail."
Raj,Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
Raj,"Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex."
Raj,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
Raj,"There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff."
Raj,"Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard."
Raj,My sister.
Raj,"Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?"
Raj,She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
Raj,"I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her."
Raj,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
Raj,"Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex."
Raj,"Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own."
Raj,"Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”"
Raj,I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
Raj,Sheldon tells it better.
Raj,I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
Raj,Come on in.
Raj,"I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
Raj,"Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it."
Raj,Okay.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,October sixth.
Raj,How about that!
Raj,"Yes, it is. Very cool!"
Raj,Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
Raj,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,"Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!"
Raj,You ever gonna tell him?
Raj,So never.
Raj,Hi!
Raj,"Why so glum, chum?"
Raj,"Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things."
Raj,"I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family."
Raj,"Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud."
Raj,I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
Raj,"Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming."
Raj,"Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him."
Raj,"Good, because I would hate that."
Raj,"Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between."
Raj,There’s no reason to worry.
Raj,I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
Raj,What else do we know about him?
Raj,I totally had one of those.
Raj,"I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?"
Raj,"Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister."
Raj,"Me, too."
Raj,"Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude."
Raj,Very nice. You lie to my sister.
Raj,"Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me."
Raj,"Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?"
Raj,"Yeah, we’re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive."
Raj,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
Raj,It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
Raj,She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
Raj,Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
Raj,Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
Raj,What’s the matter?
Raj,Very basic.
Raj,"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?"
Raj,"I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway."
Raj,"It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend."
Raj,What does that mean?
Raj,Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
Raj,"Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…"
Raj,"Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!"
Raj,"Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!"
Raj,Are you listening to this guy?
Raj,So what’s up?
Raj,"Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay."
Raj,Yeah. Good or devastating.
Raj,What?
Raj,"No rush, no rush."
Raj,I know. It’ll be awful.
Raj,"Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place."
Raj,"I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark."
Raj,No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
Raj,"Me, too. Good times."
Raj,This was nice.
Raj,"I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard."
Raj,My sister told me.
Raj,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
Raj,What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
Raj,Shut your ass!
Raj,How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
Raj,Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
Raj,"Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may."
Raj,This is it.
Raj,You will?
Raj,"Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail."
Raj,The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
Raj,I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
Raj,"Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly."
Raj,I need a hug.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
Raj,"I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue."
Raj,"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
Raj,What?
Raj,Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Oh, cool. Can I play?"
Raj,No.
Raj,"No, thank you. I’m fine."
Raj,"I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down."
Raj,"I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
Raj,"Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared."
Raj,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Raj,I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
Raj,That’s not the point.
Raj,"I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
Raj,"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend."
Raj,"Okay, let’s see if this drug works."
Raj,"Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful."
Raj,India.
Raj,It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
Raj,"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Raj,"We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone."
Raj,And what is your name?
Raj,"Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate."
Raj,"Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!"
Raj,"Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other."
Raj,"Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat."
Raj,Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
Raj,"Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places."
Raj,Sorry. Walking tree.
Raj,I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
Raj,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
Raj,"Sheldon, that’s my water."
Raj,I know.
Raj,"Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you."
Raj,One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
Raj,"Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about."
Raj,"You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal."
Raj,Like what?
Raj,"What do you mean, a show?"
Raj,"Like, to music?"
Raj,So you’d do a striptease?
Raj,"Good, good."
Raj,"Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that."
Raj,Your big problem is me telling her.
Raj,What if she wasn’t kidding?
Raj,He takes the elf from off the shelf.
Raj,Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
Raj,I got a colossal serpent right here.
Raj,"Sorry, I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo."
Raj,"Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron."
Raj,"Okay, gotta go."
Raj,Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
Raj,I guess that’s okay.
Raj,"She’s kidding, right?"
Raj,Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
Raj,"Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room."
Raj,"Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?"
Raj,"Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep."
Raj,"Good night, Sheldon."
Raj,You’re kidding.
Raj,I was sleeping.
Raj,"Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry."
Raj,"Scotty, I need more power."
Raj,"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy."
Raj,"Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?"
Raj,Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
Raj,Can I bring girls here?
Raj,"Okay, deal."
Raj,"He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips."
Raj,When did you take my blood?
Raj,What the hell is this?
Raj,This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
Raj,Did you sign this?
Raj,"Well, that seems fair."
Raj,"Sheldon, dinner!"
Raj,This is the difference between eating and dining.
Raj,It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
Raj,I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
Raj,"He’s living at my place, so I’m living here."
Raj,It’s a good thing.
Raj,More wine?
Raj,"Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
Raj,Every night.
Raj,It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,"Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
Raj,"What’s wrong with me, Penny?"
Raj,"Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared."
Raj,To friendship.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,What is it to you?
Raj,"Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard."
Raj,"Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love."
Raj,"Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
Raj,"He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
Raj,Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
Raj,"That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny."
Raj,"Please, come in."
Raj,"Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me."
Raj,I’m sorry.
Raj,"I will. Hey, Bernadette?"
Raj,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
Raj,"Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?"
Raj,It’s all over her Facebook page.
Raj,"I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo."
Raj,"Aw, there’s a thing."
Raj,You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
Raj,Oh. All right.
Raj,"Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense."
Raj,"No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection."
Raj,"Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
Raj,I did. It was beautiful.
Raj,"Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
Raj,"Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?"
Raj,"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?"
Raj,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
Raj,"Okay, just the candle thing."
Raj,Cool. All right friend.
Raj,I’ll see you around.
Raj,Penny?
Raj,It’s getting beautiful again.
Raj,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
Raj,"Sure, whatever."
Raj,"Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower."
Raj,Sorry. Go on.
Raj,This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
Raj,"Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini."
Raj,"Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about."
Raj,How can you be so racist?
Raj,I’ll try it. Like this?
Raj,Like this?
Raj,Better?
Raj,I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
Raj,"I, I nibbled. I was being playful."
Raj,Sorry. Better?
Raj,"Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
Raj,What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
Raj,Mmmmmm.
Raj,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
Raj,"No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister."
Raj,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
Raj,That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
Raj,I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
Raj,What’s it thinking about now?
Raj,Hi.
Raj,Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
Raj,"Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe."
Raj,"Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again."
Raj,"Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t."
Raj,"Oh, she’s here."
Raj,"Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
Raj,I worked on it all night. Use it.
Raj,Then spell it.
Raj,You’re blowing this for me!
Raj,You’re making me sound like a caveman.
Raj,"Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
Raj,"Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones."
Raj,Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
Raj,"Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?"
Raj,You’re right. Everyone loves music.
Raj,"No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants."
Raj,"Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey."
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Dude, what is she saying?"
Raj,What? Why?
Raj,"It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there."
Raj,"Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?"
Raj,"If you were me, would you kiss her?"
Raj,I was so smooth on that date.
Raj,"Whatever, dude. She kissed me."
Raj,"Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us."
Raj,I’m so mad at you!
Raj,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
Raj,I’m hammered.
Raj,The best one I ever had!
Raj,"Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman."
Raj,It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
Raj,"Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. "
Raj,"I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise."
Raj,Penny?
Raj,"I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too."
Raj,What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
Raj,"Well, I choose love."
Raj,"My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love."
Raj,"Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad."
Raj,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
Raj,Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
Raj,"Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati."
Raj,"Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you."
Raj,Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
Raj,"So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?"
Raj,Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
Raj,Sure.
Raj,"Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?"
Raj,"Well, I just met her gynaecologist!"
Raj,"I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead."
Raj,Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
Raj,"Nothing, I’m fine."
Raj,No. 
Raj,I’m so lonely.
Raj,"I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better."
Raj,You should’ve seen your face.
Raj,He’s probably right.
Raj,I had pee his pants.
Raj,What is she doing in a comic book store?
Raj,You have a thing of paper clips right there.
Raj,I don’t know. Maybe.
Raj,All right.  Who do we have here?
Raj,"Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
Raj,Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
Raj,"Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable."
Raj,"Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
Raj,This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars."
Raj,I really don’t get your problem with birds.
Raj,Hummingbirds are pretty.
Raj,"Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth."
Raj,"Yes, please. This is way better than the movie."
Raj,That is one tough birdie.
Raj,"Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out."
Raj,"They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
Raj,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
Raj,"Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?"
Raj,I’ll take one.
Raj,Wild Bill Witchcock.
Raj,Incredibly so.
Raj,Incredibly so.
Raj,Annie Ogly.
Raj,Totally you.
Raj,"Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
Raj,"Yeah, it’s also a wand."
Raj,Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Raj,You’re so full of it.
Raj,You unfriended me? Seriously?
Raj,Is that him over there?
Raj,How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
Raj,"So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?"
Raj,What’s that one?
Raj,"Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too."
Raj,"That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie."
Raj,That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
Raj,"That was pretty badass, dude."
Raj,What’s that?
Raj,"Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential."
Raj,"I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it."
Raj,"Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?"
Raj,"Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
Raj,"Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?"
Raj,"Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?"
Raj,What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
Raj,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
Raj,"I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement."
Raj,"If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock."
Raj,Because she’s great in everything.
Raj,He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
Raj,I guess it didn’t go well.
Raj,You were in the middle of an erection.
Raj,I will take that action.
Raj,"I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
Raj,"Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment."
Raj,"Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy.  Hello?"
Raj,What’s your name?
Raj,Are you single?
Raj,"Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?"
Raj,I will see you gentlemen later.
Raj,"So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?"
Raj,What are you doing right now?
Raj,You have a beautiful voice.
Raj,I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
Raj,"No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?"
Raj,"Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj."
Raj,I’d like you to call me sexy.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,"Thank you, darling."
Raj,I’m sorry?
Raj,I haven’t bonded with it.
Raj,It’s just a phone.
Raj,"Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers."
Raj,"Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady."
Raj,Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
Raj,"Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."
Raj,"Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz."
Raj,"Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria."
Raj,Thank you.  
Raj,"Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz."
Raj,"Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
Raj,"Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite."
Raj,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
Raj,How’d you do?
Raj,They put you under for a cleaning?
Raj,Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
Raj,Their meatballs are pretty good.
Raj,"Nothing, nothing."
Raj,"Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?"
Raj,Buzz Lightyear is not real.
Raj,"Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
Raj,"Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz."
Raj,"All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?"
Raj,Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
Raj,"Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed."
Raj,They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
Raj,"Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes."
Raj,"Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."
Raj,Gamma.
Raj,Upsilon?
Raj,"Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way."
Raj,"You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
Raj,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
Raj,"No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?"
Raj,"Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
Raj,"Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated."
Raj,Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
Raj,Follow your heart.
Raj,Like what?
Raj,Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
Raj,It was a nice retirement party.
Raj,"Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad."
Raj,I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
Raj,"Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
Raj,"Ooh, limited edition. Nice."
Raj,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
Raj,Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,"I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice."
Raj,"What, you don’t like wind chimes?"
Raj,So?
Raj,"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m."
Raj,But it says eight a.m.
Raj,It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
Raj,"You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza."
Raj,"Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you."
Raj,"Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?"
Raj,You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
Raj,"Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
Raj,We were badass back in the day.
Raj,It’s on like Alderaan.
Raj,Woo-hoo!
Raj,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
Raj,"Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
Raj,"Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
Raj,"What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend."
Raj,"Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff."
Raj,"Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard."
Raj,"But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"
Raj,"Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil."
Raj,I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
Raj,I’ll let you know.
Raj,"Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one."
Raj,Who are you bringing?
Raj,"Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells."
Raj,I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
Raj,"Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time."
Raj,"No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual."
Raj,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
Raj,"‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife."
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two."
Raj,"Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here."
Raj,It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
Raj,"Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."
Raj,"Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you."
Raj,"Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette."
Raj,And this is Howard.
Raj,Please have a seat.  I’m thinking double wedding!
Raj,"Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
Raj,"Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake."
Raj,"Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls."
Raj,I’d like to tell them things are going well.
Raj,"Okay, what page are you on?"
Raj,Say again.
Raj,"Like, dude on dude, but with women?"
Raj,"Why me, of all people?"
Raj,I’m not gay.
Raj,"That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex."
Raj,I like to boogie.
Raj,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
Raj,"Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it."
Raj,Ready for lunch?
Raj,"Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi."
Raj,"We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian."
Raj,"Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true."
Raj,"She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it."
Raj,"Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises."
Raj,"It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
Raj,Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
Raj,I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
Raj,Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
Raj,"This is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
Raj,"What, you told her?"
Raj,"So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone."
Raj,"Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?"
Raj,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
Raj,"I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
Raj,Why?
Raj,"Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out."
Raj,"That’s really nice of you, Howard."
Raj,"That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math."
Raj,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
Raj,"Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly."
Raj,You can make him do anything you want.
Raj,"Well, don’t be too mean."
Raj,I wouldn’t mind a glass.
Raj,Bring him to his bony knees.
Raj,"Wow, that’s amazing."
Raj,I thought he might be a little more excited.
Raj,"Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having."
Raj,He got us again.
Raj,"Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party."
Raj,"I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs."
Raj,You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
Raj,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
Raj,"Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic."
Raj,"Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…"
Raj,"May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz."
Raj,Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
Raj,"Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?"
Raj,"Hear, hear."
Raj,"Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world."
Raj,"I’m not done, but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
Raj,"Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!"
Raj,"Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?"
Raj,"The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here."
Raj,"Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."
Raj,"You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here."
Raj,"Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street."
Raj,"Thank you, Bernadette."
Raj,"Dude, I am so sorry."
Raj,I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
Raj,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
Raj,"Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
Raj,"When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle."
Raj,You weren’t?
Raj,"Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
Raj,You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
Raj,"From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know."
Raj,Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
Raj,"Well, I know how to make it special."
Raj,"Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space."
Raj,"I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip."
Raj,"Oh, thanks, man."
Raj,"What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready."
Raj,Penny.  
Raj,"Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers."
Raj,"Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute."
Raj,I believe you two have prepared vows?
Raj,"Me, too."
Raj,"Right now, Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz."
Raj,I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
Raj,Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,I’m all for it.
Raj,"Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round."
Raj,"Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?"
Raj,"Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool."
Raj,Really? I can come? Thanks.
Raj,Yoo-hoo! Over here!
Raj,Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.
Raj,You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
Raj,"You know, Amy, I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start."
Raj,I don’t understand.
Raj,"It’s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right. "
Raj,"My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?"
Raj,Hello-lo-lo.
Raj,"I was, but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date."
Raj,Sweet!
Raj,"You know, I’m growing to like American football. "
Raj,"Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?"
Raj,"No, thank you."
Raj,"Oh, I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?"
Raj,What? Why?
Raj,"Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection."
Raj,"Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude."
Raj,"Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night."
Raj,"I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful."
Raj,"Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it. "
Raj,"Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!"
Raj,I really thought she would say it.
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Raj,"Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave."
Raj,You sure?
Raj,All right. Great.
Raj,What are you drinking?
Raj,Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.
Raj,Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
Raj,"She’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?"
Raj,Cheers.
Raj,Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
Raj,Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.
Raj,I should go.
Raj,"Uh, thank you for the drink."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Raj,"Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?"
Raj,No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,"Bye, buddy!"
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, come on in."
Raj,What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
Raj,Focused Locust.
Raj,"So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink."
Raj,‘Cause that’s what we do.
Raj,"In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee."
Raj,"Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.   che-ee-ee-ese."
Raj,"Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs."
Raj,"Yeah, well, I love her."
Raj,"Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?"
Raj,I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
Raj,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
Raj,The Fantastic Four reunited.
Raj,We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
Raj,"Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun."
Raj,"Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew."
Raj,"Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow."
Raj,"Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"
Raj,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
Raj,"Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday."
Raj,"Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time."
Raj,"It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes."
Raj,Which part?
Raj,"Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket."
Raj,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
Raj,"Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?"
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party."
Raj,Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
Raj,"You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything."
Raj,"Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party."
Raj,"Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night."
Raj,On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
Raj,It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
Raj,"Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?"
Raj,"So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who."
Raj,Do you have a preference?
Raj,"Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?"
Raj,I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
Raj,What’s wrong with you?
Raj,"Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you."
Raj,No.
Raj,It’s called being nice.
Raj,Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
Raj,"What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese."
Raj,Is this about the space thing again?
Raj,"Try to keep up, Howard, I’m killing it."
Raj,"You’re welcome, ladies."
Raj,Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
Raj,I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
Raj,"I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I’m going to try using an American accent."
Raj,"Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I’m making fun of them."
Raj,"Dude, my accent is brilliant.  Hey, my snow-white American friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese."
Raj,"Sheldon, do I really sound like that?"
Raj,"Sheldon, you okay?"
Raj,The guy’s a genius. Maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
Raj,"All right, hotshot, let’s hear your Indian."
Raj,"Okay, yeah, that’s pretty good."
Raj,It’ll be okay.
Raj,"Yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him."
Raj,So don’t do it.
Raj,Then don’t do it.
Raj,Wow. An end of an era.
Raj,When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
Raj,What are you drawing over there?
Raj,He probably just goes to the bathroom.
Raj,It’s sad that you know that.
Raj,"Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for."
Raj,"Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties."
Raj,It was tapenade and you guys suck.
Raj,"Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place."
Raj,We just told you.
Raj,"I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny."
Raj,"Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."
Raj,I think it’s an old storage room.
Raj,"Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?"
Raj,I’m listening.
Raj,"I can’t do anything right for you, can I?"
Raj,He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
Raj,"Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay."
Raj,"Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars."
Raj,"I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar."
Raj,"No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas."
Raj,"But next time, we’ll be cat burglars."
Raj,Are you sure?
Raj,When did you learn how to pick locks?
Raj,How did that work out?
Raj,"Hold on, hold on."
Raj,"Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."
Raj,What if it’s booby-trapped?
Raj,"Great, what’s your pl… "
Raj,Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
Raj,Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
Raj,He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
Raj,"Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved."
Raj,"Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out."
Raj,It’s the atomic number for technetium.
Raj,Do you think he’s building a bomb?
Raj,"Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt."
Raj,"I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?"
Raj,"Hey, hey. Feelings."
Raj,"Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?"
Raj,Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
Raj,What the balls is forty-three?
Raj,That’s good quality video.
Raj,How did you get your hands on that?
Raj,"Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it."
Raj,I don’t know.
Raj,Holy crap!
Raj,Aah! It’s eating his face!
Raj,"Sheldon, we’re really sorry."
Raj,And what does forty-three mean?
Raj,"Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now."
Raj,"They are, too."
Raj,"No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing."
Raj,That’s called a fashion choice.
Raj,Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
Raj,Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
Raj,"Okay, here’s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?"
Raj,I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
Raj,"Hey, got a minute?"
Raj,Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
Raj,"Howard, that’s not how we practiced it."
Raj,Just say it.
Raj,an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
Raj,"I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises."
Raj,"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it."
Raj,"What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?"
Raj,"If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here."
Raj,"No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves."
Raj,"You got this, buddy."
Raj,You can do it.
Raj,"Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, Howard wins."
Raj,"So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place."
Raj,"Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
Raj,"No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you."
Raj,"But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?"
Raj,"Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me."
Raj,"Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died."
Raj,"Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!"
Raj,Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
Raj,"My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout."
Raj,"No, no, no, I’m fine."
Raj,Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.
Raj,That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
Raj,"Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens."
Raj,"Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub."
Raj,In a New Delhi minute.
Raj,"Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
Raj,What?
Raj,"Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t."
Raj,"No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me."
Raj,It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
Raj,"Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals."
Raj,That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.
Raj,"No, not really."
Raj,Not that I can think of.
Raj,"Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?"
Raj,"Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you."
Raj,"I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me."
Raj,"Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person."
Raj,It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
Raj,But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.
Raj,Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
Raj,Damn it.
Raj,"Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her."
Raj,"I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest."
Raj,"Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz."
Raj,How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.
Raj,I talk with my eyes.
Raj,"Oh, my God. You’re loving this."
Raj,I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
Raj,"Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move."
Raj,Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
Raj,"I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good."
Raj,Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
Raj,How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
Raj,I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
Raj,I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
Raj,"Well, this is all your fault."
Raj,"If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening."
Raj,"Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles."
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn’t do anything."
Raj,Howard built a sex robot.
Raj,That is so cool.
Raj,"You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks."
Raj,Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
Raj,"And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done."
Raj,I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
Raj,Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
Raj,"Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…"
Raj,Stop!
Raj,"I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants."
Raj,What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
Raj,Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
Raj,Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
Raj,"And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now."
Raj,"It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party."
Raj,Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
Raj,"Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him."
Raj,"Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?"
Raj,What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
Raj,Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
Raj,Are they actually arguing about comic books?
Raj,"If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party."
Raj,"So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?"
Raj,"Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories."
Raj,"What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?"
Raj,No.
Raj,They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
Raj,"Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel."
Raj,This sucks.
Raj,You! Always bet on black.
Raj,"It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  He’s right, dawg."
Raj,"You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us."
Raj,"Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer."
Raj,"Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic."
Raj,"Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money."
Raj,"Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money."
Raj,Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
Raj,"Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?"
Raj,I think this thing was made in China.
Raj,"Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle."
Raj,And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
Raj,"Oh, I wish I was in better shape."
Raj,"Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today."
Raj,Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
Raj,"Wow, that’s harsh."
Raj,Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
Raj,Here you go.
Raj,"What, you don’t say thank you?"
Raj,"Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?"
Raj,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
Raj,Is there a good anal leakage?
Raj,"Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made."
Raj,Sure.
Raj,"Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity."
Raj,"Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night."
Raj,"I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky."
Raj,"No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant."
Raj,"Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst."
Raj,"That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?"
Raj,"I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert."
Raj,Sure.
Raj,Hello?
Raj,"Okay, I guess."
Raj,"Actually, I’m still here."
Raj,"Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed."
Raj,"Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times."
Raj,"Oh, boy. Breakfast."
Raj,But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
Raj,"Oh, Howard, stop."
Raj,You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
Raj,"They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey."
Raj,You were right. I can’t get out of here.
Raj,"I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?"
Raj,"Come on, Howard, help me."
Raj,"Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?"
Raj,"But, Howard…"
Raj,Everything okay?
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?"
Raj,"Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet."
Raj,"Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?"
Raj,"Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself."
Raj,It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.
Raj,Except on a date with anybody.
Raj,"You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved."
Raj,"Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever."
Raj,"Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion."
Raj,We’re glad you could make it.
Raj,What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
Raj,"I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone."
Raj,You really think so?
Raj,"Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?"
Raj,"Later, losers!"
Raj,"So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you."
Raj,"I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this.  I should have bought condoms."
Raj,What?
Raj,I was humiliated by yet another woman.
Raj,"No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."
Raj,I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
Raj,"Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon."
Raj,"You’re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone."
Raj,I don’t want to celebrate.
Raj,Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.
Raj,"No, you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter."
Raj,"You’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, I’ve made my choice."
Raj,"See you. No, wait, take her number. I don’t want the temptation."
Raj,"I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe."
Raj,Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
Raj,"Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello."
Raj,"Uh, would you like to come in?"
Raj,Oh.
Raj,"Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons."
Raj,Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
Raj,"Yeah, me neither."
Raj,I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.
Raj,"That’s great. I’m broken, too."
Raj,"Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage."
Raj,"Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you’ll see."
Raj,"You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it’s done."
Raj,Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
Raj,"Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date."
Raj,"Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler."
Raj,"Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India."
Raj,"Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?"
Raj,"I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people."
Raj,"Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date."
Raj,"She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea."
Raj,"No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from."
Raj,I’m counting that as foreplay.
Raj,"These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette."
Raj,"Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first."
Raj,"Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party."
Raj,"Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge."
Raj,So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
Raj,"Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone."
Raj,"Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while."
Raj,Of course.
Raj,Shame on all of you.
Raj,"Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?"
Raj,"If you want, we could tell you."
Raj,"Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny."
Raj,"Yeah,"
Raj,"I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before."
Raj,Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
Raj,"Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure."
Raj,"Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it."
Raj,It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
Raj,"You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man."
Raj,"And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride."
Raj,"Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video."
Raj,"Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon."
Raj,Where have you been?
Raj,I don’t know.
Raj,"Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay, let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals."
Raj,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
Raj,"Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is."
Raj,I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.
Raj,"You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing."
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?"
Raj,You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
Raj,"Yeah, screw it. I’m going in."
Raj,"Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?"
Raj,"Wait, hold on. This is weird."
Raj,"I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog."
Raj,"She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?"
Raj,"Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils."
Raj,"Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin."
Raj,"No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary."
Raj,"No, this is creepy."
Raj,"It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses."
Raj,Do you think I’m feminine?
Raj,Thanks a lot.
Raj,"I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine."
Raj,I have to talk to her about this.
Raj,"Well, that doesn’t seem fair."
Raj,"No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair."
Raj,Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
Raj,"I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John."
Raj,"Uh, Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice."
Raj,Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
Raj,"Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey."
Raj,Come in.
Raj,"Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she’ll rip your face off."
Raj,Thanks. I love hockey.
Raj,"Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?"
Raj,Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
Raj,What do you mean?
Raj,I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.
Raj,"Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me."
Raj,"No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine."
Raj,"You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly."
Raj,I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
Raj,"Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?"
Raj,Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
Raj,And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
Raj,"It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like."
Raj,"Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it."
Raj,"Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner."
Raj,Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
Raj,"A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar."
Raj,"Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours."
Raj,"Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry."
Raj,"Well, I, I thought about…"
Raj,"Sorry. I, I just…"
Raj,Anything can happen.
Raj,"I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want."
Raj,I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
Raj,"Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her."
Raj,"Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya."
Raj,"You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye."
Raj,I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
Raj,"Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet."
Raj,Really?
Raj,"I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that."
Raj,What else have you been thinking about doing?
Raj,I like your bangs.
Raj,What else?
Raj,"Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies."
Raj,How are your crab cakes?
Raj,That’s great.
Raj,"No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance."
Raj,Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?
Raj,Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
Raj,Don’t be silly. Just tell him.
Raj,"Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."
Raj,Lucy?
Raj,"You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
Raj,Why would you leave like that?
Raj,"Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?"
Raj,"Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk."
Raj,"Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful."
Raj,"So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes."
Raj,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
Raj,"I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
Raj,"Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."
Raj,"If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by."
Raj,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
Raj,"Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
Raj,"Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra."
Raj,"Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
Raj,Of course.
Raj,Okay. I have a request to make.
Raj,"The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
Raj,"Actually, I was thinking Leonard."
Raj,"You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger."
Raj,Good idea. Bernadette?
Raj,"Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman."
Raj,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
Raj,"Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her."
Raj,What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
Raj,"Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot."
Raj,We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
Raj,"I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
Raj,"Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry."
Raj,"You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party."
Raj,"A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
Raj,"Oh, please?"
Raj,"Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it."
Raj,"Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me."
Raj,"She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?"
Raj,"Uh, go ahead. Read it."
Raj,Excuse me.
Raj,Hang on.
Raj,"That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in."
Raj,No.
Raj,"No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away."
Raj,"Penny, I, I miss her already."
Raj,"What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?"
Raj,"No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable."
Raj,"No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night."
Raj,I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
Raj,So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
Raj,"Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
Raj,"… but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."
Raj,"I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all."
Raj,"Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good."
Raj,Is that true?
Raj,"How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."
Raj,You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
Raj,You would do that for me?
Raj,"Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?"
Raj,"Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. "
Raj,I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
Raj,All right.
Raj,"Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas."
Raj,"Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed."
Raj,"That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones."
Raj,"You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
Raj,"So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable."
Raj,"Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?"
Raj,"I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
Raj,"You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common."
Raj,"Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it."
Raj,"Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog."
Raj,"Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person."
Raj,"No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
Raj,Good night.
Raj,And then some. I think we had a moment.
Raj,Who died and made you king of moments?
Raj,There was.
Raj,"I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her."
Raj,"No, not a thing."
Raj,"Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan."
Raj,"Hey, what’s your problem?"
Raj,Why are you on a diet?
Raj,"Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
Raj,"No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches."
Raj,"Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?"
Raj,"Well, it’s kind of hard to tell. "
Raj,"I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this."
Raj,Do you want my help or not?
Raj,"Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing."
Raj,"Hmm. Uh, let me see something. "
Raj,"Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  I mean, yeah, maybe."
Raj,"You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you."
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
Raj,Yay.
Raj,"A little loud, dude."
Raj,"Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were."
Raj,"Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
Raj,"So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party."
Raj,"No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
Raj,"Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties."
Raj,Because I’ve got something even better planned.
Raj,Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
Raj,"So, uh, who’s in?"
Raj,"Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins."
Raj,Any questions?
Raj,"Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
Raj,"Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt."
Raj,"Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive."
Raj,Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
Raj,"Good riddle, huh?"
Raj,I invited you to my murder mystery party.
Raj,Oh.
Raj,"Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was."
Raj,"Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today."
Raj,"Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner."
Raj,"Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny."
Raj,"Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time."
Raj,I just wanted to do something beautiful.
Raj,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
Raj,"Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure."
Raj,"Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect."
Raj,"Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
Raj,"Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you."
Raj,"Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?"
Raj,"Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
Raj,"My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
Raj,"Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on."
Raj,"Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business."
Raj,"Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
Raj,"Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!"
Raj,"Three, two, one. "
Raj,"Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
Raj,"Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight. "
Raj,"What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?"
Raj,"In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?"
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"Dude, this is, this is brutal. "
Raj,"This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
Raj,"Yeah, anything is better than this."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,I was wrong. This is worse.
Raj,Like a hero.
Raj,"I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. "
Raj,"I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops."
Raj,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
Raj,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
Raj,"It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride."
Raj,As you wish.
Raj,Amy.
Raj,"Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
Raj,That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
Raj,You want a TUMS?
Raj,"No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy."
Raj,Thanks.
Raj,"It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her."
Raj,Why is that great news?
Raj,That is so beautiful.
Raj,Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
Raj,Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
Raj,"Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
Raj,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
Raj,"As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…"
Raj,"Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach. "
Raj,"Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
Raj,"Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
Raj,"Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
Raj,"Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap."
Raj,"Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat."
Raj,"Oh, please?"
Raj,"It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you."
Raj,"Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?"
Raj,"Oh, that’s a big deal."
Raj,"Actually, I’m busy."
Raj,There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
Raj,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
Raj,"Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about."
Raj,"Penny, how’s it going over there?"
Raj,"Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you."
Raj,"Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom. "
Raj,"Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her."
Raj,They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
Raj,I didn’t know you were coming again.
Raj,"No, thanks."
Raj,My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
Raj,I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
Raj,But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
Raj,"There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
Raj,"Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. "
Raj,Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
Raj,"Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something."
Raj,"Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle."
Raj,Oh gets better.
Raj,"And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
Raj,Not even to sleep?
Raj,"So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?"
Raj,I don’t get it.
Raj,"No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras."
Raj,You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
Raj,"What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny."
Raj,"Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?"
Raj,Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
Raj,"He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
Raj,"Well, can I say she looks nice?"
Raj,Can I tell her I miss her?
Raj,"Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
Raj,"Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike."
Raj,"Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you."
Raj,"Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?"
Raj,"Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes."
Raj,"I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
Raj,"I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
Raj,"This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?"
Raj,"I love you, Penny."
Raj,Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
Raj,"I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me. "
Raj,"Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
Raj,It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
Raj,"Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
Raj,I’m in.
Raj,"Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?"
Raj,"Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?"
Raj,"Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key."
Raj,"Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here."
Raj,"No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything."
Raj,"My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens."
Raj,Wonder what she saw in that guy.
Raj,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
Raj,Stir the gravy. 
Raj,"Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray."
Raj,"No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth."
Raj,And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.
Raj,"Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner."
Raj,Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.
Raj,"Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day."
Raj,"Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly."
Raj,All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen. 
Raj,There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.
Raj,"Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha."
Raj,"Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great."
Raj,He loves you.
Raj,I’m just being a good house guest.
Raj,"Oh, come on, I brought you one, too."
Raj,That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
Raj,"Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
Raj,Hang on.
Raj,Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
Raj,"Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
Raj,"Oh, what did I do?"
Raj,"Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
Raj,"I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again. "
Raj,"Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
Raj,"And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
Raj,"Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?"
Raj,"Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones."
Raj,If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
Raj,I’ve never seen it.
Raj,Maybe this time he’s going to do it.
Raj,"You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds."
Raj,Sounds about right.
Raj,"Open wide, here comes the happy train."
Raj,"Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah."
Raj,"Oh, man, that is so us."
Raj,"My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay."
Raj,Keep going. 
Raj,Ew.
Raj,"At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends."
Raj,"Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding."
Raj,"Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time."
Raj,"Come on, Leonard, dinner."
Raj,"You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Yeah, but why are you fat?"
Raj,Congrats.
Raj,"Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
Raj,So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
Raj,I don’t see why not. 
Raj,Can we bring anything?
Raj,"I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?"
Raj,Are possums cute?
Raj,You mean like fatties and uggos?
Raj,I’m sure you were great.
Raj,No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
Raj,"That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?"
Raj,"Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
Raj,"I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here."
Raj,That’s a mirror.
Raj,Sorry.
Raj,"Uh, excuse me. "
Raj,"Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?"
Raj,"Okay, nice talking to you."
Raj,"Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join."
Raj,Hey. Good to see you.
Raj,He brought you a pretty rock.
Raj,"Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type."
Raj,"Yeah, grow up, Howard. God."
Raj,And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
Raj,"Yeah, knock it off, Howard."
Raj,"Well, do you support this?"
Raj,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
Raj,"Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury."
Raj,Megan Pincus.
Raj,"Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?"
Raj,Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
Raj,"I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
Raj,He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
Raj,Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
Raj,"So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?"
Raj,We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.
Raj,"Oh, it all comes down to this."
Raj,"Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad."
Raj,And I told you I get diaper rash.
Raj,Anyone in?
Raj,"Uh, what number in line are you?"
Raj,"Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left."
Raj,So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?
Raj,We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
Raj,"Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
Raj,How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
Raj,Does he sound like a criminal?
Raj,"You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
Raj,"I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
Raj,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
Raj,"Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message."
Raj,Do it.
Raj,That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
Raj,You know I struggle with Batman.
Raj,"Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
Raj,What about that little cup they give you?
Raj,Are you impressed by that?
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,It is. I feel alive.
Raj,Maybe slapped with a fine.
Raj,"Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? "
Raj,"He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
Raj,I thought you were a badass.
Raj,"Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?"
Raj,I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
Raj,Except I’ll be alone.
Raj,"Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room."
Raj,"Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
Raj,"Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
Raj,"Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up."
Raj,"As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?"
Raj,"Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?"
Raj,"All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Oh, yeah?"
Raj,She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
Raj,Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
Raj,"There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it."
Raj,"Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin."
Raj,You mean a moo-stache?
Raj,"Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right."
Raj,Moo-stache.
Raj,"Here, you can have your seat."
Raj,"Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA."
Raj,Magic wand TV remote?
Raj,Did Bernadette think it was cool?
Raj,"Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand."
Raj,"Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle."
Raj,What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
Raj,Wow. What did you tell them?
Raj,"A second trip to space, I’ll miss you."
Raj,"And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone."
Raj,"And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather."
Raj,It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
Raj,Course.
Raj,Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
Raj,Why me?
Raj,"That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill."
Raj,Do you think this is cool?
Raj,Aha.
Raj,"Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you."
Raj,"Oh, of course."
Raj,Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
Raj,"And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on."
Raj,"Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts."
Raj,Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
Raj,Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
Raj,"Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like, two years."
Raj,You’re only making it seem more real for me.
Raj,Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
Raj,Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
Raj,"While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters."
Raj,"If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong."
Raj,Ha-a-a. Still funny.
Raj,I was there. It was funny.
Raj,"Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs."
Raj,"I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it."
Raj,"No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile."
Raj,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Raj,"What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years."
Raj,"Amy, I could use some help."
Raj,"I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing."
Raj,"And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman."
Raj,"Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first."
Raj,"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
Raj,"I know. Powerful stuff, huh?"
Raj,"Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here."
Raj,Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
Raj,"I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."
Raj,"Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words."
Raj,Teams are fun.
Raj,But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…
Raj,Do that. See?
Raj,Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
Raj,Plane tickets? Yeah.
Raj,Stop that? Okay.
Raj,"Hey, you busy?"
Raj,Have you heard back from Emily?
Raj,Great. And?
Raj,"I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
Raj,"I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second."
Raj,What’s happening tomorrow night?
Raj,What?
Raj,"I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?"
Raj,Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
Raj,"Hello, Emily."
Raj,"Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?"
Raj,"Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."
Raj,"Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either."
Raj,"He’s in Texas, he’ll never know."
Raj,Have you heard from Howard?
Raj,"Hey, Stuart!"
Raj,"Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like."
Raj,Stuart? Are you okay?
Raj,Stuart?
Raj,"Well, it’s too late."
Raj,He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
Raj,Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
Raj,You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
Raj,"Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?"
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves."
Raj,"Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi."
Raj,Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
Raj,"Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
Raj,Any question but that.
Raj,I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
Raj,"Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun."
Raj,"Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends."
Raj,"Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them."
Raj,"No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."
Raj,From the future? How fun and imaginative.
Raj,Correct.
Raj,"Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?"
Raj,"Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored."
Raj,"Fine, just try not to look too alive."
Raj,Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
Raj,"Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna."
Raj,"Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids."
Raj,Can we please get back to the game?
Raj,"Oh, come on."
Raj,"I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout."
Raj,You’re just saying that.
Raj,Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
Raj,And it’s done.
Raj,"Hey. Emily, right?"
Raj,"I, I don’t know if you remember me."
Raj,"Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it."
Raj,"Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me."
Raj,"Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile."
Raj,"And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet."
Raj,"Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."
Raj,I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
Raj,"Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way."
Raj,"It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion."
Raj,"Uh, Xbox One."
Raj,"Oh, my goodness."
Raj,I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
Raj,What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
Raj,"I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot."
Raj,"But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?"
Raj,Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
Raj,"Oh, no."
Raj,Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
Raj,"As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes."
Raj,"You look, you look really pretty tonight."
Raj,"Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew."
Raj,"My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful."
Raj,"No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?"
Raj,"Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,"Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
Raj,"Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you."
Raj,Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
Raj,I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
Raj,"Yeah, literally, none of it."
Raj,"Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?"
Raj,"Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy."
Raj,"She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you"
Raj,At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
Raj,Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
Raj,You’re really going to do this?
Raj,It’s going to be okay.
Raj,"Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily."
Raj,She’s very real.
Raj,See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
Raj,You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
Raj,No jokes about the year I took ballet.
Raj,"God, you never listen."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,"Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily."
Raj,Since when do you go to spin class?
Raj,"Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever."
Raj,"Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him."
Raj,"Wh, what happened?"
Raj,Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
Raj,"She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary."
Raj,No problem. How’s your mom feeling?
Raj,"You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese."
Raj,I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
Raj,"Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?"
Raj,"I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her."
Raj,"Uh, so, you’ll watch it?"
Raj,You’re a good friend. I owe you one.
Raj,Not that one.
Raj,"Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."
Raj,You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.
Raj,"All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it."
Raj,"Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."
Raj,"On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?"
Raj,What do you mean?
Raj,I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
Raj,I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
Raj,What?
Raj,"Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses."
Raj,"Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into."
Raj,"And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
Raj,"Then, why do you watch these things?"
Raj,Sure.
Raj,And play.
Raj,May the fourth be with you?
Raj,"Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day."
Raj,Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.
Raj,And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
Raj,"Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?"
Raj,"Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road."
Raj,"Ugh, let’s get this over with."
Raj,"You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI."
Raj,It was just a suggestion.
Raj,Wow.
Raj,Should we try to console him?
Raj,By staying here and watching the movie.
Raj,"Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him."
Raj,Maybe we should see how he’s doing.
Raj,But after the cantina scene.
Raj,"Hey, we can say it. You can’t."
Raj,Please hurry.
Raj,"If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?"
Raj,All right. Now what?
Raj,Do you know how to set it up?
Raj,So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
Raj,So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
Raj,Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
Raj,Is that a real thing?
Raj,"Emily, Hey."
Raj,"Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily."
Raj,Are you here alone?
Raj,"What do you mean, not really?"
Raj,"Yeah, okay."
Raj,Uh-huh.
Raj,Yes.
Raj,Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
Raj,You don’t have to make me anything.
Raj,"Sorry, I left them in my turban."
Raj,Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
Raj,"But you don’t have sex with her, either."
Raj,"To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."
Raj,No.
Raj,"I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?"
Raj,What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
Raj,What do you mean?
Raj,Eleven.
Raj,Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
Raj,I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
Raj,"Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Of course. Please, come in."
Raj,"Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other."
Raj,It’s okay.
Raj,"Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours."
Raj,"Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
Raj,"Well, me, neither."
Raj,"Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?"
Raj,I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
Raj,"It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?"
Raj,"It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder."
Raj,"But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
Raj,"What up, guys?"
Raj,And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
Raj,"Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?"
Raj,"You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times."
Raj,"When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me."
Raj,"Dude, I’m so sorry."
Raj,"We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?"
Raj,"Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night."
Raj,"Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel."
Raj,Thanks for the lift.
Raj,I’m having my windows untinted.
Raj,Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
Raj,"Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work."
Raj,I thought Stuart was looking after her.
Raj,How so?
Raj,Like us?
Raj,She feeds him out of her own mouth?
Raj,So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
Raj,"Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…"
Raj,"I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious."
Raj,It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
Raj,"That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45."
Raj,"I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults."
Raj,"You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing."
Raj,‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
Raj,This is the part where you talk.
Raj,"Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy."
Raj,"But half-man, half-owl could fly…"
Raj,"So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?"
Raj,"Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney."
Raj,I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
Raj,You enjoy giving people grades.
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry."
Raj,"Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?"
Raj,What’s wrong with you?
Raj,"Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer."
Raj,Is that right?
Raj,250 million years.
Raj,Why didn’t girls like us in high school?
Raj,"You suck, Wolowitz."
Raj,I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
Raj,You look like a jackass.
Raj,"So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?"
Raj,"Come on Howard, fire it in."
Raj,Yup.
Raj,Is it too late for him to cancel?
Raj,"Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,We still on for tomorrow night?
Raj,Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
Raj,You guys kiss and hold hands.
Raj,"Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship."
Raj,"Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,"Emily, you know almost everybody here."
Raj,"And this is Leonard, this is Penny."
Raj,I told you she exists.
Raj,"You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company."
Raj,"So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?"
Raj,"Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place."
Raj,"Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
Raj,We are now.
Raj,"Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody."
Raj,We were having a conversation about past lovers.
Raj,"Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?"
Raj,"Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list."
Raj,Great.
Raj,"You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,Thanks for inviting us over.
Raj,"Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?"
Raj,"It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have."
Raj,"It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life."
Raj,I’m so glad we could work this all out.
Raj,Great.
Raj,I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
Raj,And snacks.
Raj,"Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking."
Raj,Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
Raj,Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
Raj,"Ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
Raj,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
Raj,Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,Why not?
Raj,"For your information, Emily is working tonight."
Raj,"Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie."
Raj,"Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it."
Raj,Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
Raj,"Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
Raj,"Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet."
Raj,"Oh, I have an idea."
Raj,I’ll make the popcorn.
Raj,"He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff."
Raj,Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
Raj,"Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work."
Raj,Go online and look it up.
Raj,"That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is."
Raj,That cannot be true.
Raj,"Hey, it was match point."
Raj,Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
Raj,And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.
Raj,"Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny."
Raj,No way. Not Bill Murray.
Raj,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
Raj,"Yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
Raj,"You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
Raj,"You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
Raj,Yup.
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, you busy?"
Raj,Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
Raj,"So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees."
Raj,"It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."
Raj,"Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
Raj,"Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket."
Raj,"Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
Raj,Exactly.
Raj,So where should we do it?
Raj,"Uh, Sheldon…"
Raj,Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
Raj,Did you get in?
Raj,This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
Raj,"Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame."
Raj,We’re going to be fine.
Raj,I’m sweating already.
Raj,How hot is it?
Raj,"Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be."
Raj,How you feeling?
Raj,Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
Raj,Do you know any mining songs?
Raj,It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
Raj,Getting kind of grim.
Raj,Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
Raj,"So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache."
Raj,But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
Raj,We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
Raj,What if we brought them down with us?
Raj,"Oh, this heat is brutal."
Raj,How’s that going?
Raj,"Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop."
Raj,You don’t have to bite my head off.
Raj,"If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable."
Raj,Oh. Is it Amy?
Raj,"Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager."
Raj,The space probe.
Raj,"By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this."
Raj,"You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward."
Raj,Really?
Raj,"Oh, cool."
Raj,I would love to see your collection.
Raj,Preach.
Raj,"Well, that didn’t go your way."
Raj,"Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?"
Raj,The gun from Hellboy?
Raj,How did you get it?
Raj,"Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles."
Raj,"Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond."
Raj,You think he bites?
Raj,You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
Raj,Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
Raj,"Okay, now you’re messing with me."
Raj,One ladder left.
Raj,And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
Raj,Like who?
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster."
Raj,Did you go to your prom?
Raj,How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
Raj,That sounds like a yes.
Raj,"Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close."
Raj,"Hey, here comes Stuart and his date."
Raj,That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
Raj,"It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?"
Raj,This is so messed up.
Raj,"Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…"
Raj,"Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them."
Raj,"Anyway, any ideas on a gift?"
Raj,"They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
Raj,"Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you."
Raj,"Dude, my parents just split up."
Raj,"Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out."
Raj,"No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali."
Raj,I’m okay.
Raj,How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
Raj,Hey. What brings you by?
Raj,I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
Raj,Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
Raj,"I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
Raj,"Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother."
Raj,"Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?"
Raj,"Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy."
Raj,"You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross."
Raj,That’s rough.
Raj,"I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off."
Raj,Poor Roger Abbott.
Raj,"Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott."
Raj,"When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?"
Raj,"Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie."
Raj,"Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."
Raj,Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
Raj,The doorman said this is the right building.
Raj,"I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."
Raj,Does it work?
Raj,"Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know."
Raj,"You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel."
Raj,"Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm."
Raj,And we still don’t know who framed him.
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,"Oh, well, that’s the best part."
Raj,"Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
Raj,That would be nice.
Raj,"Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving."
Raj,You guys suck.
Raj,Can we please talk about anything else?
Raj,Dad.
Raj,There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
Raj,"Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax."
Raj,Yup. Bye.
Raj,"Hey, what’s going on?"
Raj,Should have put it in the bag first.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,Actually.
Raj,"All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard."
Raj,"No, you’re the one who let him in."
Raj,Come on.
Raj,"Uh, you have to take the pin out."
Raj,What did you do?
Raj,"Dude, it’s not breathing."
Raj,"What do you mean, not again?"
Raj,I’ll do it.
Raj,"Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit."
Raj,It’s a Christmas miracle.
Raj,Someone should really close that loading door.
Raj,"Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks."
Raj,"Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy."
Raj,"Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious."
Raj,"If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy."
Raj,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
Raj,"I can’t take it, dude."
Raj,"No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin."
Raj,I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
Raj,We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
Raj,Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
Raj,"Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me."
Raj,"Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"
Raj,"Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack."
Raj,I can’t stop thinking about it.
Raj,I know.
Raj,"Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this."
Raj,What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
Raj,"Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company."
Raj,"If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple."
Raj,I meant a Hindu temple.
Raj,"Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians."
Raj,"Yeah, it’s pretty great."
Raj,Why?
Raj,"Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it."
Raj,So?
Raj,That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
Raj,"Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe."
Raj,Actually there’s no proof of that.
Raj,"You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
Raj,All right. Shall we?
Raj,Like what?
Raj,"Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?"
Raj,"Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us."
Raj,"Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs."
Raj,You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
Raj,"Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa."
Raj,"Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater."
Raj,I may not be liking this game so much.
Raj,"You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange."
Raj,"All right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
Raj,"You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships."
Raj,And you think that’s going to help?
Raj,I don’t think that’s what you want at all.
Raj,Come on.
Raj,"Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
Raj,"Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?"
Raj,"Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe."
Raj,"Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?"
Raj,"Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv."
Raj,What does it say?
Raj,Did he respond yet?
Raj,"I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper."
Raj,No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
Raj,"Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."
Raj,"Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those."
Raj,See? Better with the accent.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon!"
Raj,I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
Raj,"You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work."
Raj,"Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
Raj,Our pleasure.
Raj,"Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
Raj,"Smart, looks like we’re being helpful."
Raj,"Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion."
Raj,"And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea."
Raj,"No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing."
Raj,So should we go talk to him?
Raj,"What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones."
Raj,"I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible."
Raj,"Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great."
Raj,"Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating."
Raj,Thanks.
Raj,"Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys."
Raj,"And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him."
Raj,Great.
Raj,"Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?"
Raj,"Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion."
Raj,I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
Raj,"Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook."
Raj,That’s what I said when we moved it.
Raj,"No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."
Raj,What can we do?
Raj,He’s hanging in there.
Raj,"Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener."
Raj,"Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."
Raj,What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.
Raj,Why don’t you just do the test?
Raj,"Yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
Raj,"You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous."
Raj,"Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?"
Raj,"Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate."
Raj,"Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
Raj,"Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?"
Raj,"I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text."
Raj,"Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
Raj,"So, what do you guys want to do?"
Raj,"Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now."
Raj,"Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?"
Raj,"Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
Raj,"Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded."
Raj,"Uh, Origin of Species."
Raj,"Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down."
Raj,"It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
Raj,"So, where’s your roommate tonight?"
Raj,"But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
Raj,That’s okay. I can come back later.
Raj,"Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward."
Raj,"Oh, good."
Raj,"Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?"
Raj,"What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?"
Raj,"So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap."
Raj,I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
Raj,She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
Raj,"Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back."
Raj,"Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no."
Raj,"Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping."
Raj,Hang on.
Raj,With what?
Raj,She does.
Raj,Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
Raj,"This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know."
Raj,"Okay, where should I put them?"
Raj,You’re not helping.
Raj,"You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…"
Raj,"Oh, no. Hey."
Raj,How was the hospital?
Raj,"Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand."
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
Raj,"Come on, think back. It would really help if you had."
Raj,Thank you for forgiving me.
Raj,"Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself."
Raj,Of course. What?
Raj,No. Just the drawer.
Raj,"I promise. Why, what’s in there?"
Raj,"Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing."
Raj,It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
Raj,Everything okay?
Raj,"You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science."
Raj,"Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."
Raj,"Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up."
Raj,"Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna."
Raj,"One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup."
Raj,You got it.
Raj,I’m not making any promises.
Raj,"Mm, and not a vegetable in sight."
Raj,I would like to propose a salon topic.
Raj,The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
Raj,"You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"
Raj,"No, not at all."
Raj,"Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?"
Raj,"Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong."
Raj,You could play Ping-Pong for it.
Raj,"Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion."
Raj,What?
Raj,"We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother."
Raj,So did I.
Raj,"Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good."
Raj,"Okay, uh, I’m gonna own you, bitch."
Raj,Let’s just play.
Raj,"What, and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?"
Raj,You’re wrong.
Raj,"Yes, you are."
Raj,The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
Raj,"Hey, I got you a little gift."
Raj,"You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?"
Raj,"Wow, so you’re not curious at all?"
Raj,"Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo."
Raj,"So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?"
Raj,"You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit."
Raj,Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
Raj,"Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?"
Raj,"A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
Raj,You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
Raj,"Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?"
Raj,I get it. What do you want to do?
Raj,"All right, I’ve got your back."
Raj,"Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road."
Raj,"But technically, yes."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
Raj,"Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
Raj,"Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."
Raj,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
Raj,"Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team."
Raj,Hey. Thanks for coming by.
Raj,"I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around."
Raj,You should have told him to mind his own business.
Raj,What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
Raj,"Huh, what does that make us?"
Raj,"Okay, that sounds good."
Raj,"Okay, that sounds like us."
Raj,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
Raj,No. We can do this by ourselves.
Raj,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
Raj,"Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized."
Raj,"Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver."
Raj,"Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die."
Raj,And he’s all white.
Raj,And Gertie can’t stop crying.
Raj,"Okay, let’s talk about something else."
Raj,And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
Raj,"Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers."
Raj,Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
Raj,"Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well."
Raj,"Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
Raj,"We, we can totally do that."
Raj,This is great.
Raj,What?
Raj,"Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers."
Raj,"Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
Raj,"Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help."
Raj,"It wasn’t, so are you in?"
Raj,"Okay, I think we should do it right now."
Raj,Okay.
Raj,"So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it."
Raj,"Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said."
Raj,"Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon."
Raj,"Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like."
Raj,"Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."
Raj,"Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
Raj,"Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over."
Raj,"Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard."
Raj,"He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge."
Raj,"It’s, like, the best one they make, I just can’t get it to work."
Raj,It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
Raj,"Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?"
Raj,I don’t know. Why do I own one?
Raj,"Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?"
Raj,"Very well, thank you."
Raj,"If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask."
Raj,"Oh, you’re where that bill goes."
Raj,"No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week."
Raj,"But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…"
Raj,"Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
Raj,I don’t freaking believe this.
Raj,"No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it."
Raj,What?
Raj,"Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this."
Raj,"Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello, Mummy."
Raj,"Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?"
Raj,"Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."
Raj,"Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you."
Raj,"All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy."
Raj,"Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody."
Raj,What’s the first one?
Raj,"You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter."
Raj,Not cool.
Raj,What a baby.
Raj,Check.
Raj,"It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy."
Raj,"Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay."
Raj,Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.
Raj,"Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?"
Raj,How’d you do that?
Raj,We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
Raj,"Hey, I don’t even live here."
Raj,"I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible."
Raj,How old is this Jell-O?
Raj,"Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
Raj,"Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship."
Raj,Looks good.
Raj,Ooh. Hot date?
Raj,"You’re kidding, right?"
Raj,"I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose."
Raj,"No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you."
Raj,You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
Raj,"No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard."
Raj,"She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave."
Raj,What difference does it make?
Raj,"Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?"
Raj,"I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her."
Raj,You guys are being jerks.
Raj,You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
Raj,"Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am."
Raj,"Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am."
Raj,"So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are."
Raj,"Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit."
Raj,I think we should talk.
Raj,"Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people."
Raj,"No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside."
Raj,End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
Raj,Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
Raj,Didn’t even crack the top ten.
Raj,I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
Raj,Really?
Raj,"Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride."
Raj,I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
Raj,And you knew about this this whole time?
Raj,And you didn’t think to tell me?
Raj,Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
Raj,Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
Raj,I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
Raj,Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
Raj,How do you know?
Raj,And I’m just hearing about this now?
Raj,"You don’t have to, you should want to."
Raj,"I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle."
Raj,"Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?"
Raj,Now we are done.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more."
Raj,"Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."
Raj,"Yeah, Penny packed you a bag."
Raj,"Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too."
Raj,And I told you he bit me.
Raj,"This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman."
Raj,"Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it."
Raj,"Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea."
Raj,We can drive there.
Raj,What’s wrong with Mexico?
Raj,We don’t have any of those.
Raj,"Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?"
Raj,"Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness."
Raj,When did you learn how to change a tyre?
Raj,Are you turning it the right way?
Raj,"Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way."
Raj,It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
Raj,There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
Raj,Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
Raj,"If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
Raj,"If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?"
Raj,I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
Raj,Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
Raj,"Hey, look, the lug nut’s off."
Raj,Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator.
Raj,I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.
Raj,"Hey, we’ve always talked about playing together."
Raj,"Oh, we could play filk music."
Raj,"It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
Raj,"Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name."
Raj,Really?
Raj,What is it?
Raj,I just got chills.
Raj,"So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
Raj,"Okay, so it’s a, it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones."
Raj,"Okay, I don’t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that’s no man, it’s a Norse god."
Raj,"That is, that is so good!"
Raj,"Okay, and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
Raj,"Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?"
Raj,That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
Raj,"Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder."
Raj,"Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?"
Raj,Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
Raj,Just be honest. You don’t like it.
Raj,"You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
Raj,"I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it."
Raj,"You can do both, like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?"
Raj,I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.
Raj,"Yeah, so what?"
Raj,"No, no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past."
Raj,She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
Raj,That is so not true.
Raj,That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
Raj,"Fine, I quit, too."
Raj,With pleasure.
Raj,What took you so long?
Raj,"Thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
Raj,When was the last actual exercise you got?
Raj,Are you?
Raj,I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
Raj,We can still be swashers.
Raj,"Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones."
Raj,"Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer."
Raj,Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
Raj,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Raj,My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Raj,"Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you."
Raj,"Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work."
Raj,How many sips of that beer did he have?
Raj,Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
Raj,"Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,What are you guys up to?
Raj,"Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not."
Raj,"Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out."
Raj,You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
Raj,That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
Raj,You may want to leave the room.
Raj,I have that same underwear.
Raj,I had a great time last night.
Raj,What? I thought we were all… never mind.
Raj,"Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13."
Raj,"Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names."
Raj,"Oh. Hey, high five."
Raj,"So, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
Raj,"Oh, okay. Got it."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
Raj,I’m sorry. I did what I could.
Raj,That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
Raj,"Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
Raj,"It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have."
Raj,"Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."
Raj,So what’s up?
Raj,You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
Raj,"Hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
Raj,"Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay."
Raj,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
Raj,"Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would."
Raj,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
Raj,"Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information."
Raj,I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
Raj,This is exciting.
Raj,"I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard."
Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
Raj,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
Raj,"Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract."
Raj,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
Raj,Forty-five.
Raj,Thirty seconds.
Raj,"Guys, fifteen seconds."
Raj,"Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad."
Raj,"I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams."
Raj,Answer it.
Raj,How could you send her away?
Raj,Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
Raj,"You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?"
Raj,Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
Raj,I don’t sound like that.
Raj,Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
Raj,"You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!"
Raj,"You know, this reminds me of high school."
Raj,"No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny."
Raj,"You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes."
Raj,"No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being."
Raj,Me.
Raj,"Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?"
Raj,They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
Raj,"Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…"
Raj,"It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up."
Raj,But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
Raj,"So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."
Raj,"Yeah, we totally did."
Raj,Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
Raj,"How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."
Raj,Well what do you want to write?
Raj,"Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now."
Raj,Okay. I posted it.
Raj,"Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco."
Raj,"Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too."
Raj,"He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him."
Raj,That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
Raj,"Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks."
Raj,"It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it."
Raj,"From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
Raj,"Yeah, like she could get Trent."
Raj,"So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?"
Raj,I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
Raj,"And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"
Raj,"It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done."
Raj,"Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?"
Raj,Ooh!
Raj,"No, never heard of ’em!"
Raj,Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?
Raj,"Guys, they’re gonna sell out."
Raj,Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
Raj,I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
Raj,Tonight’s the night.
Raj,Let’s do this.
Raj,I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.
Raj,"Oh, did you hear from Wil?"
Raj,Check.
Raj,What is everyone booing at?
Raj,"Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me."
Raj,And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
Raj,It is.
Raj,"Leonard, I, I’m scared again."
Raj,I don’t think I can walk right now.
Raj,"Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me."
Raj,"Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
Raj,Low self-esteem.
Raj,Lack of confidence.
Raj,Pushover.
Raj,"Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced."
Raj,Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
Raj,Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
Raj,"Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours."
Raj,"No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there."
Raj,"Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?"
Raj,No.
Raj,"Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found."
Raj,It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
Raj,"Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet."
Raj,"Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…"
Raj,A medium-sized asteroid.
Raj,I kind of like chicken fingers.
Raj,"Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."
Raj,You dream different than me.
Raj,"Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it."
Raj,"So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."
Raj,How is that both our names?
Raj,"Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?"
Raj,"I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you."
Raj,"Wait, what happened to us?"
Raj,We haven’t settled on anything yet.
Raj,That is a great idea.
Raj,"So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?"
Raj,That’s just Amy.
Raj,But it’s beautiful.
Raj,Yay.
Raj,"Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Raj,I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
Raj,"Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in."
Raj,"Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
Raj,"Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus."
Raj,Of course I do.
Raj,"Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology."
Raj,"Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it."
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop."
Raj,"No, come on, please don’t leave."
Raj,What is wrong with you?
Raj,"You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying."
Raj,"Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going."
Raj,That’s very mature of you.
Raj,"You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah."
Raj,"Oh, God."
Raj,"You know, Sheldon…"
Raj,"I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?"
Raj,"She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."
Raj,"Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it."
Raj,"I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
Raj,"It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life."
Raj,"Oh, I see you’re reading Saga."
Raj,"It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover."
Raj,"I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard."
Raj,"Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire."
Raj,"Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
Raj,"Well, astrophysicist."
Raj,Sure. I love animated movies.
Raj,Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
Raj,"Yeah, great."
Raj,"Yeah, bye."
Raj,So?
Raj,I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
Raj,I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
Raj,Just to help her with her screenplay.
Raj,"Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes."
Raj,"Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"
Raj,"All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship."
Raj,I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
Raj,"Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store."
Raj,"Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend."
Raj,"Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out."
Raj,"Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?"
Raj,"Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
Raj,"I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?"
Raj,"Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
Raj,"Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding."
Raj,"Okay. That hurts a little, but okay."
Raj,"Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy."
Raj,"Yeah, of course. We have no secrets."
Raj,He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
Raj,"Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work."
Raj,And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.
Raj,I will.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
Raj,"Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other."
Raj,"You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?"
Raj,"Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"
Raj,"Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?"
Raj,"Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out."
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,"You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days."
Raj,But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
Raj,Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
Raj,I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
Raj,"Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?"
Raj,"No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much."
Raj,Kripke? Is that you?
Raj,"But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?"
Raj,"Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again."
Raj,"Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents."
Raj,I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
Raj,"Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays."
Raj,"Hey, bud."
Raj,"If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one."
Raj,That’s so amazing.
Raj,"Well, he could bring the baby here."
Raj,"I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars."
Raj,"I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance."
Raj,I wasn’t joking.
Raj,"Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
Raj,"I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…"
Raj,It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
Raj,"Uh, it’s in the corner."
Raj,I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
Raj,They have that. It’s called Uber.
Raj,"Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City."
Raj,It’s a good sign.
Raj,"Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us."
Raj,Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
Raj,"Just bust a move,"
Raj,"Just bust a move,"
Raj,He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
Raj,"You mean, some guy in a lame suit?"
Raj,"Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?"
Raj,"You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie."
Raj,"What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney."
Raj,Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
Raj,"Yeah, of course."
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, say something."
Raj,"And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."
Raj,"Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do."
Raj,"I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
Raj,"I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?"
Raj,"Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk."
Raj,"You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box."
Raj,Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
Raj,"I know, she’s so thoughtful."
Raj,"You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her."
Raj,It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.
Raj,"Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know."
Raj,"Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me."
Raj,Maybe you’re right.
Raj,"Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.  Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?"
Raj,Hello?
Raj,"Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?"
Raj,"Maybe, maybe."
Raj,"I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this."
Raj,"I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea."
Raj,"Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys."
Raj,"Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night."
Raj,"No, I kind of feel like being alone right now."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,Will do.
Raj,"Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
Raj,"I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?"
Raj,Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.
Raj,"Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?"
Raj,"Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything."
Raj,That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?
Raj,Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
Raj,"Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over."
Raj,"No, no. Please don’t cry."
Raj,"Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…"
Raj,I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.
Raj,"Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by."
Raj,"I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…"
Raj,Call you right back.
Raj,"I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."
Raj,"As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
Raj,Good talk.
Raj,Hey. Where are the guys?
Raj,I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
Raj,"Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?"
Raj,"Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya."
Raj,I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
Raj,Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
Raj,Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
Raj,"Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it."
Raj,I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
Raj,"No, ma’am."
Raj,"I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either."
Raj,"Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up."
Raj,Busting you.
Raj,Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
Raj,No spoilers. No spoilers.
Raj,"No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."
Raj,"Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,"Please, my pleasure."
Raj,I don’t understand.
Raj,Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
Raj,"No, I got it."
Raj,"Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity."
Raj,"I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds."
Raj,"Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?"
Raj,Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
Raj,Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
Raj,Are you sure you can do this?
Raj,"I buried it there, so we could go home."
Raj,Wow.
Raj,You guys made a person.
Raj,And I like to think I helped.
Raj,But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
Raj,"Well, that’s just Batman."
Raj,"Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them."
Raj,"No, I’m actually dating two women. Later."
Raj,"Man, I’m worn out."
Raj,"No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting."
Raj,"But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love."
Raj,"You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?"
Raj,"Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?"
Raj,I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
Raj,"Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like."
Raj,"Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog."
Raj,"I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?"
Raj,How could you say that?
Raj,I never said that.
Raj,"Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her."
Raj,"Hey, did I say something to upset you?"
Raj,"Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."
Raj,"Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me."
Raj,"It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with."
Raj,"Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here."
Raj,"Okay, then you go there."
Raj,"Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?"
Raj,"Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous."
Raj,"All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?"
Raj,"You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones."
Raj,"Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned."
Raj,Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
Raj,"Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex."
Raj,I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
Raj,"Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?"
Raj,"Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity."
Raj,Funny how that worked out.
Raj,"No, I’m still dating her."
Raj,"They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions."
Raj,"It’s, it’s beautiful."
Raj,"Hey, Claire."
Raj,"Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
Raj,Why would it be too big a step?
Raj,"Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart."
Raj,"Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that."
Raj,"Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual."
Raj,"Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma."
Raj,"Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener."
Raj,"Also, uh, cherries?"
Raj,Hey.
Raj,You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
Raj,"Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it."
Raj,I said no questions.
Raj,"Zack, this is my friend Claire."
Raj,"Uh, she’s seeing me."
Raj,We’re just keeping it casual.
Raj,"Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire."
Raj,"I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is."
Raj,"Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco."
Raj,"So, uh, what are you guys talking about?"
Raj,Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
Raj,Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
Raj,"Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line."
Raj,"Uh, I’d say by three."
Raj,"Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do."
Raj,"Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair."
Raj,"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy."
Raj,You can’t make me feel bad.
Raj,He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
Raj,You sure?
Raj,You’re right. You realize what this means?
Raj,Congratulations.
Raj,Open it.
Raj,Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
Raj,"Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America."
Raj,"Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention."
Raj,"No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible."
Raj,You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
Raj,"Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America."
Raj,"Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American."
Raj,I also love the enemies of America.
Raj,"Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help."
Raj,"What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side."
Raj,I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
Raj,"Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us."
Raj,"Oh, no."
Raj,"I, I think he wants us to pull over."
Raj,It is funny when you think about it.
Raj,Hello.
Raj,Howard Wolowitz?
Raj,Address?
Raj,"Um, no. "
Raj,May I ask what this is about?
Raj,Very well.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,That’s not him.
Raj,What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
Raj,Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
Raj,"Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."
Raj,"Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me."
Raj,That’s what he said to me.
Raj,"Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it."
Raj,You know that hurts my feelings.
Raj,Okay. 
Raj,"Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?"
Raj,"Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
Raj,"I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife."
Raj,Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
Raj,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
Raj,"To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
Raj,"Well, you’re kidding, right?"
Raj,Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
Raj,"Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman."
Raj,"Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer."
Raj,My cousin does work in a call centre.
Raj,"Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office."
Raj,Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
Raj,"So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
Raj,And you just let him?
Raj,So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
Raj,"Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel."
Raj,And right here.
Raj,He is so afraid of his feelings.
Raj,"Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do."
Raj,"So, what should we do today?"
Raj,"Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
Raj,"Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
Raj,"Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?"
Raj,You have to get to it eventually.
Raj,How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
Raj,"You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am."
Raj,"Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start."
Raj,"Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."
Raj,"Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?"
Raj,"Wow, it’s so cute."
Raj,"Oh, and did they have kids?"
Raj,"Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all."
Raj,I skipped spin class for this.
Raj,"I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
Raj,Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
Raj,"Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple."
Raj,"Well, not now."
Raj,"Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you."
Raj,Sorry. Sorry.
Raj,So where are we going?
Raj,Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
Raj,I’m sorry?
Raj,"Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
Raj,"Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts."
Raj,"Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story."
Raj,"Uh, pull over."
Raj,"Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
Raj,What? No.
Raj,No.
Raj,"This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her."
Raj,Well I don’t.
Raj,"I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN."
Raj,I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful. 
Raj,"The polite response is, thank you for noticing."
Raj,"If you want, you can find out right now."
Raj,"Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
Raj,It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
Raj,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
Raj,"What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you."
Raj,"Okay, well, that’s a problem."
Raj,Hello?
Raj,Hello?
Raj,Hello.
Raj,What time do you and Bernadette head out?
Raj,I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
Raj,"I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India."
Raj,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
Raj,Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
Raj,"Answer the question, what are you doing here?"
Raj,Here you go.
Raj,Shall we toast?
Raj,So how’s your apartment?
Raj,So why don’t you get it fixed?
Raj,"If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place."
Raj,"Actually, I’m single now."
Raj,"It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay."
Raj,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, a little."
Raj,"I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
Raj,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
Raj,"Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home."
Raj,You coming?
Raj,Why?
Raj,Yeah?
Raj,Wait till you see the crib we found.
Raj,"Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies."
Raj,"Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting."
Raj,"Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
Raj,"Then again, he did think you were my husband."
Raj,"Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk."
Raj,"No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those."
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride."
Raj,"Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite."
Raj,I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
Raj,We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
Raj,"If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?"
Raj,"Oh my God, that’s who you look like."
Raj,"Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
Raj,Eating cake on the toilet single. 
Raj,"I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in."
Raj,"Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
Raj,That would be amazing.
Raj,"We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
Raj,Do you like living with her?
Raj,"Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble."
Raj,"Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble."
Raj,It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
Raj,"Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce."
Raj,Good point. And you are?
Raj,"Oh, well, nice to meet you."
Raj,"Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella. "
Raj,"Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories."
Raj,You’re welcome.
Raj,Okay.
Raj,Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
Raj,"Oh, no, that’s mine."
Raj,"Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
Raj,What? What are you talking about?
Raj,That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
Raj,There’s nothing to tell.
Raj,It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
Raj,Isabella. 
Raj,"Yes, in the telescope room."
Raj,"Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good."
Raj,Mm-hmm.
Raj,"No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
Raj,"No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for."
Raj,"Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
Raj,"Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
Raj,"Oh, so, you are unencumbered?"
Raj,"I love kids, how old is he?"
Raj,That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.
Raj,"That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common."
Raj,"Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
Raj,"Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too."
Raj,I think you’re very nice as well.
Raj,"Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us."
Raj,"Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you."
Raj,Welcome.
Raj,"Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here."
Raj,"Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while."
Raj,That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
Raj,"Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
Raj,"That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?"
Raj,"So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?"
Raj,"I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
Raj,Uh.
Raj,Uh. 
Raj,"No, p-please don’t."
Raj,"Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
Raj,"I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
Raj,"Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies."
Raj,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
Raj,It’s my one move.
Raj,Great. Where would you like to go?
Raj,"Excuse me, but I’m Indian."
Raj,Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
Raj,Over half a million dollars.
Raj,"Hey, congratulations Bert."
Raj,"This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
Raj,What’s this button do?
Raj,I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
Raj,"Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward."
Raj,Then the robot uprising has begun.
Raj,"He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him."
Raj,"It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
Raj,Sure.
Raj,"Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
Raj,I think you’re both cute.
Raj,"Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?"
Raj,"Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
Raj,"Okay, cool."
Raj,"Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout."
Raj,"So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
Raj,Although it was already under control.
Raj,It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
Raj,"Well, they already had a village."
Raj,"Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival."
Raj,I’m here to put the crib together.
Raj,"Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib."
Raj,Why are you being like this?
Raj,"Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
Raj,"Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?"
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
Raj,At least my nose is naturally brown.
Raj,I’ll do it.
Raj,Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
Raj,I’ll pull the van up.
Raj,"Team Baby, go."
Raj,"All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
Raj,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
Raj,"I love you, too. We’re good."
Raj,12 minutes.
Raj,"You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek."
Raj,"I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
Raj,Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
Raj,"You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
Raj,"Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this."
Raj,"I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
Raj,"Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language."
Raj,"Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
Raj,You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
Raj,You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
Raj,No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
Raj,"This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now."
Raj,"I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous."
Raj,"And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay."
Raj,"For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you."
Raj,"Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile."
Raj,"Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
Raj,Excuse me.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move."
Raj,"I bought the first one, it didn’t fall."
Raj,Congratulations.
Raj,Really?
Raj,"You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
Raj,"Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Raj,"You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave."
Raj,"Oh, he’s really good with her."
Raj,"She’s tired, that was funny."
Raj,"Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk."
Raj,So how were your holidays?
Raj,Be there bright and early.
Raj,"Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby. "
Raj,Have you tried anything to fix it?
Raj,"I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?"
Raj,Did that do anything?
Raj,"Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do."
Raj,"Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
Raj,"Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
Raj,"Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny."
Raj,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons. 
Raj,"Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down. "
Raj,It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
Raj,Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
Raj,"Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song. "
Raj,"Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck."
Raj,"Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed."
Raj,I broke up with her.
Raj,She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.
Raj,"I don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason."
Raj,Can we not play this game?
Raj,"That’s okay, I’m fine."
Raj,"I’m not a virgin, Sheldon."
Raj,"It’s okay, I’m fine."
Raj,"Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more."
Raj,"Now that Sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?"
Raj,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
Raj,"That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me."
Raj,Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.
Raj,We are going to find out.
Raj,"Well, I want information in order to improve myself."
Raj,"Don’t worry, I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin."
Raj,Hey. 
Raj,"Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes. "
Raj,"Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior."
Raj,"Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?"
Raj,"I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?"
Raj,"Uh, next?"
Raj,"Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?"
Raj,"Oh. He’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
Raj,"Howard, get out."
Raj,"Okay, that’s enough. Write down loving son."
Raj,"Yes, I’ll take you back."
Raj,"Well, that’s hard to hear, but I’ll still take you back."
Raj,"Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
Raj,What did she say?
Raj,"Okay, maybe we should just end this."
Raj,"Thank you, Howard."
Raj,"Well, that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot."
Raj,Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field.
Raj,"Dude, come on."
Raj,"I appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, I’m swooping in on her like a vulture."
Raj,"But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?"
Raj,"Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades. "
Raj,"Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
Raj,"It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I don’t care if they get fat."
Raj,"Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise."
Raj,"Very mature. Keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack."
Raj,You’re such a child.
Raj,"Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you."
Raj,"Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don’t tell me, I want to be surprised."
Raj,"You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
Raj,"Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
Raj,Whoa. Just trying to help.
Raj,"No, no. I will take care of it."
Raj,"While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
Raj,Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.
Raj,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
Raj,"Like I said, you ladies have fun."
Raj,Got it.
Raj,I would never call Howard.
Raj,"Yeah, great. Um, I’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
Raj,Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.
Raj,I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
Raj,"Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday."
Raj,How is that a T?
Raj,"Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
Raj,"Fine, you drink it."
Raj,"Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge."
Raj,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?
Raj,"Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
Raj,She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.
Raj,"Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
Raj,"And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride."
Raj,"Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
Raj,"Oh, Daddy, you’re so rich and funny."
Raj,"Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
Raj,"I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
Raj,You did?
Raj,"What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?"
Raj,I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.
Raj,Hello.
Raj,"Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist."
Raj,"Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape."
Raj,"Yeah, it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him."
Raj,It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.
Raj,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry. 
Raj,"Thank you, Penny."
Raj,My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.
Raj,Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.
Raj,"Okay, I’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
Raj,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.
Raj,"Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do."
Raj,I don’t want to say.
Raj,I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.
Raj,My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?
Raj,"Well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump."
Raj,Not really.
Raj,The housekeeper does the shopping.
Raj,I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.
Raj,I thought we were best friends?
Raj,"Guys, I’m not living in a garage."
Raj,"Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father."
Raj,"Hello, Father. We need to talk."
Raj,"I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man, and I can take care of myself."
Raj,"Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
Raj,"Dad, I’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief."
Raj,"Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will."
Raj,"Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker."
Raj,"Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem."
Raj,How bad is it?
Raj,Are you serious?
Raj,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
Raj,"That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad."
Raj,It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.
Raj,Like a business manager?
Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize."
Raj,"I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go, and I’m not."
Raj,"Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys."
Raj,"Go ahead, make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby."
Raj,"Well, so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?"
Raj,But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
Raj,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.
Raj,I have no choice.
Raj,Really? I’ll do anything.
Raj,What’s with the gloves?
Raj,I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.
Raj,"Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm."
Raj,"Here, let me help you."
Raj,"Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you."
Raj,"Stay, I’ll get her."
Raj,That’s fine. She and I can cry together.
Raj,"Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year."
Raj,What’s this?
Raj,"This is so generous of you, I, um, I don’t know what to say."
Raj,"As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money."
Raj,It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.
Raj,"I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it’s fine. I’m a big boy."
Raj,"That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
Raj,I cannot thank you enough.
Raj,"Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?"
Raj,"Oh, my God, that’s so generous."
Raj,"I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?"
Raj,"But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
Raj,"Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
Raj,"Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?"
Raj,"Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?"
Raj,"Well, to be honest, Leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
Raj,But you made the garage sound so fun. 
Raj,"One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
Raj,"Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please."
Raj,Can I get anyone anything at all?
Raj,It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
Raj,"Anyway, thanks again."
Raj,"Thank you, Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook. "
Raj,This means a lot.
Raj,"You’re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk."
Raj,What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.
Raj,"Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems."
Raj,"Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?"
Raj,That’ll do it.
Raj,"Sheldon, she’s fine."
Raj,Thank you. I appreciate that.
Raj,"Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me. "
Raj,"Well, I texted you, but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing."
Raj,"I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems."
Raj,Can I just stay in the garage?
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
Raj,"You know, we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together."
Raj,Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
Raj,"No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
Raj,Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
Raj,"Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics."
Raj,I just never want to be a burden on my friends.
Raj,"But I also upset Sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there."
Raj,"I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone."
Raj,"And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable."
Raj,"You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
Raj,Downward-facing dog. 
Raj,"Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it."
Raj,It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.
Raj,"Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?"
Raj,"Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl."
Raj,"Okay, and tree pose."
Raj,"The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food."
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.
Raj,So did you confront Jennifer?
Raj,Paul.
Raj,"Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour."
Raj,"It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer."
Raj,"With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
Raj,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
Raj,"Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin. "
Raj,I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
Raj,You want to go shopping?
Raj,"Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?"
Raj,"Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
Raj,When did he leave?
Raj,"No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings."
Raj,"Hang on, I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
Raj,I don’t want to speak for Leonard.
Raj,"But when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
Raj,I’m a good listener.
Raj,I’m sorry. What did you want to say?
Raj,"Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon."
Raj,"Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to."
Raj,"Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t."
Raj,"Wait, you don’t remember?"
Raj,"I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
Raj,It’s right here.
Raj,"Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
Raj,You’re not going to prison.
Raj,"Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone."
Raj,"Well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
Raj,"Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
Raj,"Hang on, I can see every place you went."
Raj,"Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."
Raj,"Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?"
Raj,Does this place look familiar?
Raj,These here parts?
Raj,Bye.
Raj,He took the day off.
Raj,Yeah.
Raj,"Oh, quick, sit."
Raj,"Well, I’m very happy for you."
Raj,Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.
Raj,"Oh, grow up."
Raj,"Oh, hey, guys. Come in."
Raj,So how did you two meet?
Raj,That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.
Raj,I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.
Raj,You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.
Raj,"Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
Raj,I think it shows a lot of character.
Raj,"Hey, what’s up?"
Raj,"No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
Raj,I feel bad for Bert.
Raj,"Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?"
Raj,Really?
Raj,"Sheldon, get over here and help."
Raj,"That’s it, we’re dead."
Raj,"Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
Raj,"You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?"
Raj,Like J-Lo’s hair.
Raj,"If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi."
Raj,"Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi."
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
Raj,"You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
Raj,"Damn it, he’s good at that, too."
Raj,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
Raj,"Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard."
Raj,"I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back."
Raj,"Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
Raj,Without me.
Raj,Without me.
Raj,I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.
Raj,Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.
Raj,Bert has a room for rent.
Raj,"Uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
Raj,Congratulations.
Raj,"I am, but I’ll miss you guys."
Raj,You could try saying that without smiling.
Raj,Why?
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
Raj,"Yeah, sure."
Raj,"Well, here’s your key back."
Raj,As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.
Raj,"I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life."
Raj,"Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends"
Raj,I can’t compete with that. Bye.
Raj,How are you doing with…
Raj,"It was a tutorial. And yes, I’m happy to keep Sheldon company."
Raj,"Oh, why does he need a ladder?"
Raj,"Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you. "
Raj,What just happened?
Raj,So what do you guys think that’s about?
Raj,Do you see the way she’s looking at him?
Raj,"I keep telling you, close the bathroom door."
Raj,Which is?
Raj,Can you even eat those things?
Raj,Sounds like a lot of work.
Raj,"Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon."
Raj,"Actually, I was going to suggest me."
Raj,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.
Raj,May I join you?
Raj,Good to see you.
Raj,She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
Raj,I could have made her very happy.
Raj,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
Raj,"Like, really, a million?"
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,I think you made that very clear.
Raj,We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.
Raj,No. I haven’t played the race card yet.
Raj,Whatever.
Raj,"Ooh, she’s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?"
Raj,"She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. "
Raj,"Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny."
Raj,"Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
Raj,"Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. "
Raj,I have to go.   
Raj,"I can’t feel my fingers, hurry up. "
Raj,We brought food.
Raj,"Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. "
Raj,"Hey, look, I found an iPod. "
Raj,"Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7"
Raj,"Hey, what’s with him?"
Raj,I’m coming up so you better get this party started.
Raj,"Wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents."
Raj,"Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I’m not drunk."
Raj,Sorry.
Raj,"All right, what’s next?"
Raj,It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
Raj,Hello there
Raj,"That’s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,“I’m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
Raj,"But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole."
Raj,Stairwell.
Raj,"Sheldon, are you busy?"
Raj,That’s still not funny.
Raj,And she was my second cousin.
Raj,"We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you."
Raj,"Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen."
Raj,"Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?"
Raj,"Hey, those are my lima beans!"
Raj,"So, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
Raj,"Sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!"
Raj,"Oh, too bad! Sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!"
Raj,Rum cake?
Raj,"Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?"
Raj,Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
Raj,My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
Raj,You are my heart!
Raj,You are my heart!
Raj,"Dance number aside, I’m so not gay."
Raj,Who is it?
Raj,"Oh, guess who."
Raj,"Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?"
Raj,"Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face."
Raj,"Hey, I’ve got winners."
Raj,Where indeed.
Raj,Can I sleep here tonight?
Raj,"Hey, look who decided to show up."
Raj,"Hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
Raj,"Good morning, Sheldon."
Raj,No!
Raj,"Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?"
Raj,"Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?"
Raj,"All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it’s gonna get hot in here!"
Raj,"Good Lord, what have I done?"
Raj,It’s locked.
Raj,No!
Raj,Go away!
Raj,"Oh, just because I’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened."
Raj,"As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent."
Raj,"My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix."
Raj,That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.
Raj,Anything I might have seen?
Raj,"No, never. What is porn?"
Raj,"Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports."
Raj,This was really fun.
Raj,Hey.
Raj,"Oh, no."
Raj,"All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me."
Raj,What is wrong with you?
Raj,They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.
Raj,"Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye."
Raj,"Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university."
Raj,"Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now."
Raj,"Hey, there."
Raj,"Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?"
Raj,It was Avenger versus archeologist.
Raj,"Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?"
Raj,What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
Raj,You really think so?
Raj,"I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much."
Raj,"Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move."
Raj,"Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
Raj,Hello?
Raj,Yes.
Raj,Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
Raj,Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.
Raj,Yes.
Raj,"Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run."
Raj,"Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?"
Raj,"Oh, I’ll get it."
Raj,What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
Raj,Me
Raj,"Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,"Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then."
Raj,Hello.
Raj,You’ll need a good attention span.
Raj,That’s equally effective.
Raj,Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it’s gonna be a while.
Sheldon,"You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration."
Raj,"Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him."
Raj,That’s pretty.
Raj,"Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself."
Raj,Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
Raj,It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
Raj,Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
Sheldon,Thank you very much.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds."
Sheldon,"Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves. "
Sheldon, Leonard…
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,There he is.
Sheldon,And the home of the brave.
Sheldon,"Don’t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that."
Sheldon,"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
Sheldon,"There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. "
Sheldon,I think this is the place.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t think I can do this."
Sheldon,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
Sheldon,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
Sheldon,I wouldn’t.
Sheldon,I want to leave.
Sheldon,What’s the protocol for leaving?
Sheldon,Let’s try just walking out.
Sheldon,Bye-bye
Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Sheldon,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
Sheldon,"No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
Sheldon,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
Sheldon,Evidently.
Sheldon,"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,Great.
Sheldon,Bye.
Sheldon,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
Sheldon,Not with commentary.
Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. 
Sheldon,That’s the beauty of it.
Sheldon,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.
Sheldon,To what end?
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
Sheldon,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
Sheldon,Actually that’s my work.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
Sheldon,Yeah. 
Sheldon,"If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”"
Sheldon,"I didn’t invent them, they’re there."
Sheldon,"In all of them, that is the point."
Sheldon,"Um, Penny, that’s where I sit."
Sheldon,"No, I sit there."
Sheldon,What’s the difference?
Sheldon,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. "
Sheldon,Well.
Sheldon,Fine. 
Sheldon,Aaah!
Sheldon,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. 
Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
Sheldon,I resent you saying we don’t have company.
Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
Sheldon,"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
Sheldon,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.
Sheldon,You’re lactose intolerant. 
Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
Sheldon,"You? No, you’ll only make it worse."
Sheldon,Yes. 
Sheldon,Yes. 
Sheldon,No?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development. 
Sheldon,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. 
Sheldon,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
Sheldon,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed."
Sheldon,"Yes, but not of the same species."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course."
Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
Sheldon,Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
Sheldon,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
Sheldon,"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
Sheldon,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
Sheldon,You think with your penis.
Sheldon,"Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV."
Sheldon,No I don’t. And neither do you.
Sheldon,"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
Sheldon,So we get to have a scene with him?
Sheldon,"Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV. "
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Okay, thanks for your time."
Sheldon,"Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
Sheldon,My apologies. What’s your plan.
Sheldon,It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Sheldon,What do you think their combined IQ is?
Sheldon,"Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle."
Sheldon,From the intercom.
Sheldon,Tell him about our IQ.
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,My mom bought me those pants.
Sheldon,You’re going to have to call her.
Sheldon,"It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
Sheldon,Well you got me out of my pants.
Sheldon,"Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone."
Sheldon,And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
Sheldon,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
Sheldon,"Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?"
Sheldon,Not to mention imaginary.
Sheldon,"We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
Sheldon,They’re both curry based cuisines.
Sheldon,They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Sheldon,"I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy."
Sheldon,"Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
Sheldon,"You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
Sheldon,"Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,"Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women."
Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right?"
Sheldon,You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
Sheldon,"Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. "
Sheldon,"In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
Sheldon,"Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun."
Sheldon,"Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells."
Sheldon,Challenge accepted.  We’re locked out.
Sheldon,I hardly think so. 
Sheldon,"Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
Sheldon,Archimedes would be so proud.
Sheldon,"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
Sheldon,Exactly half.
Sheldon,What’s your formula for the corner.
Sheldon,"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
Sheldon,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
Sheldon,"Yeah, those are men who just had sex."
Sheldon,"No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not."
Sheldon,"Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!"
Sheldon,"No, it hurt…  Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?"
Sheldon,"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale. "
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
Sheldon,Hang on.
Sheldon,Straightening up.
Sheldon,"This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
Sheldon,"Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
Sheldon,I helped run some cable for a webcam.
Sheldon,
Sheldon,No?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you."
Sheldon,Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.
Sheldon,"I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this."
Sheldon,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.
Sheldon,You might want to speak in a lower register.
Sheldon,"Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
Sheldon,"No,  that’s ridiculous."
Sheldon,I am not leaving until I’m done.
Sheldon,"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
Sheldon,Morning.
Sheldon,"I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life."
Sheldon,You don’t think that crosses a line?
Sheldon,You have a sarcasm sign?
Sheldon,"Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs."
Sheldon,I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
Sheldon,"Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran."
Sheldon,"Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
Sheldon,"And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor."
Sheldon,"Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!"
Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive."
Sheldon,That wasn’t sarcasm?
Sheldon,"Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this."
Sheldon,"I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could."
Sheldon,His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Sheldon,Check.
Sheldon,Check.
Sheldon,Considering what? How great this place looks?
Sheldon,We could put her stereo back there.
Sheldon,"Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. "
Sheldon,"Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?"
Sheldon,And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. 
Sheldon,"Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink."
Sheldon,Good lord!
Sheldon,Lock and load. 
Sheldon,I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!
Sheldon,"There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!"
Sheldon,"Goodbye, peasants. "
Sheldon,"I’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
Sheldon,"Wooh, I’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool."
Sheldon,Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
Sheldon,Penny for your thoughts. 
Sheldon,Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
Sheldon,"Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
Sheldon,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. "
Sheldon,"That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
Sheldon,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?"
Sheldon,Of course not. 
Sheldon,"Well, no."
Sheldon,The internet’s been down for half an hour. 
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it. "
Sheldon,"Oh, good lord."
Sheldon,"If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
Sheldon,"Leonard, listen to me…"
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. "
Sheldon,"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. "
Sheldon,"No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don’t buy a cat. "
Sheldon,"Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat. "
Sheldon,Could you be more specific?
Sheldon,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
Sheldon,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. "
Sheldon,Not if you’re a rugby team. 
Sheldon,Why would I join you?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
Sheldon,"Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
Sheldon,"If I could of, I would of. "
Sheldon,Is the sex starting now?
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
Sheldon,"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
Sheldon,Just do it.
Sheldon,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
Sheldon,"It’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
Sheldon,Me?
Sheldon,What should I tell her.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
Sheldon,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
Sheldon,Why would she be expecting me? 
Sheldon,"So, how was your date?"
Sheldon,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about time travel again.
Sheldon,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
Sheldon,"Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. "
Sheldon,"It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. "
Sheldon,"No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party."
Sheldon,"At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
Sheldon,"You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?"
Sheldon,Nothing.
Sheldon,"How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."
Sheldon,Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
Sheldon,Well here’s an interesting turn of events.
Sheldon,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
Sheldon,An actual real scientist.  How was that?
Sheldon,I can’t believe he fired me.
Sheldon,"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
Sheldon,Morning.
Sheldon,"This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment. "
Sheldon,"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
Sheldon,As do I.
Sheldon,"I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it."
Sheldon,"I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs."
Sheldon,Use new eggs. .
Sheldon,"Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
Sheldon,I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
Sheldon,"Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
Sheldon,"Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you."
Sheldon,"I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds. "
Sheldon,Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. 
Sheldon,"No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. "
Sheldon,Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Sheldon,"Slow down. Slow down, please slow down."
Sheldon,"Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
Sheldon,"No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
Sheldon,"Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb."
Sheldon,"Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."
Sheldon,"This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. "
Sheldon,"No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
Sheldon,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
Sheldon,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit. "
Sheldon,Isn’t it?
Sheldon,"Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. "
Sheldon,Well then you’ll want some manganese.
Sheldon,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. 
Sheldon,"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
Sheldon,"Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
Sheldon,"Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
Sheldon,I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. 
Sheldon,It’s an experiment. 
Sheldon,"Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be."
Sheldon,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."
Sheldon,It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do."
Sheldon,Shhhhh!
Sheldon,"That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich. "
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"I know, but why?"
Sheldon,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother. "
Sheldon,I went to the market with Penny.
Sheldon,"Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby."
Sheldon,"Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother. "
Sheldon,"To my room, and no-one’s allowed in. "
Sheldon,Morning.
Sheldon,It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. 
Sheldon,"What do you want, mom?"
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,What for?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true. "
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
Sheldon,Dr Gablehouser.
Sheldon,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. "
Sheldon,I got my job back.
Sheldon,I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. 
Sheldon,"Thanks, mom. Mom?"
Sheldon,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
Sheldon,"Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg."
Sheldon,"We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good."
Sheldon,Statistically unlikely. 
Sheldon,"I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here. "
Sheldon,Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"
Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger. "
Sheldon,Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy. 
Sheldon,We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration. 
Sheldon,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
Sheldon,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable. "
Sheldon,"You’re a lucky man, Leonard. "
Sheldon,You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. 
Sheldon,"I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared."
Sheldon,I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
Sheldon,"Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
Sheldon,Just come with me.
Sheldon,Well?
Sheldon,What does it mean?
Sheldon,"Yes, but I was eleven."
Sheldon,So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. "
Sheldon,"I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide. "
Sheldon,"Well, there’s Leonard.  And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster. "
Sheldon,"No, no, wait, hold on. "
Sheldon,"I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? "
Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. "
Sheldon,"Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!"
Sheldon,"My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations. "
Sheldon,"Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed. "
Sheldon,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having. "
Sheldon,You did this?
Sheldon,Cool?
Sheldon,"Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
Sheldon,Who told you you could touch my board?
Sheldon,I don’t come into your house and touch your board.
Sheldon,"Oh, that is so… so…"
Sheldon,"Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. "
Sheldon,I’m coming.
Sheldon,"Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. "
Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
Sheldon,She’s not that intelligent.
Sheldon,She got lucky.
Sheldon,I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky. 
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,I still don’t care. 
Sheldon,"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. "
Sheldon,"I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. "
Sheldon,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup. "
Sheldon,"Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
Sheldon,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? 
Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. 
Sheldon,"Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
Sheldon,"You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. "
Sheldon,"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. "
Sheldon,"I was giving clear, concise orders. "
Sheldon,"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
Sheldon,Dancing?
Sheldon,"The thing is, we’re not…."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,A Halloween party?
Sheldon,"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? "
Sheldon,What about comic-books?
Sheldon,Anime?
Sheldon,"TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…"
Sheldon,Oh no! 
Sheldon,"See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. "
Sheldon,"I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect. "
Sheldon,"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
Sheldon,"Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
Sheldon,"Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. "
Sheldon,And you said the party starts at seven. 
Sheldon,It’s 7:05. 
Sheldon,So what time does the costume parade start? 
Sheldon,"Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
Sheldon,This party is just going to suck. 
Sheldon,Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
Sheldon,"See, people get it. "
Sheldon,"I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? "
Sheldon,Telepathically?
Sheldon,And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
Sheldon,"Well, I actually might be able to help."
Sheldon,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. "
Sheldon,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”"
Sheldon,That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
Sheldon,Good luck. 
Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. "
Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?
Sheldon,"Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. "
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
Sheldon,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
Sheldon,Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
Sheldon,I’m the Doppler Effect. 
Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect. "
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
Sheldon,"Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now. "
Sheldon,You have a back-up hypothesis. 
Sheldon,"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. "
Sheldon,"Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is. "
Sheldon,"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. "
Sheldon,True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
Sheldon,"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
Sheldon,"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. "
Sheldon,Yet another child left behind. 
Sheldon,"Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. "
Sheldon,I’m not. No offence. 
Sheldon,"If he understands that, you’re in trouble. "
Sheldon,You’re in trouble. 
Sheldon,"Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. "
Sheldon,He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back. 
Sheldon,"Happy Halloween.  If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. "
Sheldon,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
Sheldon,Good. There there was really all I had. 
Sheldon,Good night Leonard. 
Sheldon,Coming. 
Sheldon,He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. 
Sheldon,Thank you for the clarification. 
Sheldon,Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer. 
Sheldon,"If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."
Sheldon,"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
Sheldon,8:08
Sheldon,"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
Sheldon,Oh good grief.
Sheldon,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo. "
Sheldon,"One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
Sheldon,"Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. "
Sheldon,"Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
Sheldon,"This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
Sheldon,Mine. 
Sheldon,"Yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. "
Sheldon,"Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
Sheldon,"Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. "
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. "
Sheldon,"And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…"
Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye. 
Sheldon,"It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. "
Sheldon,"Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
Sheldon,Where do I begin? 
Sheldon,"Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave. "
Sheldon,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
Sheldon,"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. "
Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. 
Sheldon,"He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it. "
Sheldon,"Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly. "
Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm. 
Sheldon,"Hmmph, wrong. "
Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
Sheldon,"It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
Sheldon,Hm! 
Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night. 
Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who. "
Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal…."
Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day. 
Sheldon,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
Sheldon,Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.
Sheldon,I’m Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B."
Sheldon,"Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother. "
Sheldon,"No more talking, everybody go. "
Sheldon,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers. 
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. 
Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. "
Sheldon,"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. "
Sheldon,"He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
Sheldon,"No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree. "
Sheldon,"And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz. "
Sheldon,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. "
Sheldon,"Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,I’ll know. 
Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
Sheldon,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is. "
Sheldon,"You can’t go out, it’s Halo night. "
Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
Sheldon, Then it’s not dancing night. 
Sheldon,"Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall. "
Sheldon,"Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
Sheldon,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
Sheldon,"It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
Sheldon,"Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
Sheldon,"No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. "
Sheldon,My point.
Sheldon,It’s Halo night. 
Sheldon,Shhh! 
Sheldon,"I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking."
Sheldon,"That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
Sheldon,We said no tanks.
Sheldon,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?
Sheldon,"Damn you, walletnook.com."
Sheldon,"The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare. "
Sheldon,It’s been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five. 
Sheldon,It says keep this on your person at all times.  It’s right here under Batman’s signature.
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,"If I may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
Sheldon,You seemed confused.
Sheldon,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession. 
Sheldon,What’s not to love?
Sheldon,I suggest you go through with it.
Sheldon,"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
Sheldon,"Understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
Sheldon,"No need, we have the special edition. "
Sheldon,"Okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. "
Sheldon,"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example. "
Sheldon,I’ll have a diet coke.
Sheldon,Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre. 
Sheldon,"Yes, "
Sheldon,Yes. And would you make it diet? 
Sheldon,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Sheldon,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills. 
Sheldon,And now we’ll never know. 
Sheldon,Sorry I’m late.
Sheldon,"Nothing, I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
Sheldon,"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
Sheldon,"So, how’s Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord."
Sheldon,That’s Princess Punchali. 
Sheldon,"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess. "
Sheldon,It’s a children’s story.
Sheldon,"When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It’s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly. "
Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
Sheldon,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
Sheldon,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali. 
Sheldon,A beloved character from an Indian folk tale. 
Sheldon,You Indian.
Sheldon,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. 
Sheldon,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can. 
Sheldon,"It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. "
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,I’m not hitting on her.
Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom. 
Sheldon,"Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
Sheldon,I could eat. 
Sheldon,"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?"
Sheldon,What did I do? 
Sheldon,"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry."
Sheldon,And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring. 
Sheldon,"And boring, her words. "
Sheldon,"Okay, well, good night."
Sheldon,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn’t already know, and I came home. "
Sheldon,Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. 
Sheldon,"Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps. "
Sheldon,"No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. "
Sheldon,"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. "
Sheldon,They found the remote controlled cars.
Sheldon,You may want to put on slacks. 
Sheldon,"You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. "
Sheldon,Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays. 
Sheldon,"Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out. "
Sheldon,I know. I read it before I threw it out. 
Sheldon,"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. "
Sheldon,"No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. "
Sheldon,You can’t. I’m the lead author. 
Sheldon,"I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome. "
Sheldon,It doesn’t need proving. 
Sheldon,"They’re not supposed to, but they should. "
Sheldon,And I forbid it. 
Sheldon,If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is. 
Sheldon,"No, once again, I’m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome. "
Sheldon,"Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly."
Sheldon,"Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. "
Sheldon,Oh dear God! 
Sheldon,A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
Sheldon,Huh.
Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. 
Sheldon,I couldn’t poop this morning. 
Sheldon,It’s certainly preferable to my plan.
Sheldon,A powerful laxative. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, little idea? "
Sheldon,"Of course you didn’t, he said little idea? "
Sheldon,"In what words then, exactly"
Sheldon,What did he say?
Sheldon,Don’t you ever speak to me again. 
Sheldon,Have fun presenting my lucky hunch. 
Sheldon,Then why did you say it.
Sheldon,Were you trying to impress Penny?
Sheldon,How’d that work out for you?
Sheldon,"Libido 1, truth zero. "
Sheldon,"And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me. "
Sheldon,"Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!"
Sheldon,"Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?"
Sheldon,"No, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. "
Sheldon,"You continue to underestimate me, my good man. "
Sheldon,"As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence. "
Sheldon,Because I knew you’d screw this up.
Sheldon,"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there. "
Sheldon,So you admit that you’re an egotist?
Sheldon,"Okay, that is it. "
Sheldon,Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm. 
Sheldon,"You hit me. You saw him, he hit me."
Sheldon,So it was working.
Sheldon,"Oh we’ll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
Sheldon,You could have offered me a ride home. 
Sheldon,"I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there’s just no pleasing you. "
Sheldon,"Well that’s not much of an apology, but I’ll take it. "
Sheldon,Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for. 
Sheldon,"Now, who would do that?"
Sheldon,"Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin. "
Sheldon,"Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
Sheldon,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. 
Sheldon,", too late, I win. "
Sheldon,"I don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. ."
Sheldon,"I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. "
Sheldon,I have a conclusion based on an observation.
Sheldon,I think I know.
Sheldon,I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six. 
Sheldon,You just lied to Penny.
Sheldon,"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
Sheldon,"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. "
Sheldon,"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago. "
Sheldon, Leonard…
Sheldon,I need to speak to you.
Sheldon,It’s important.
Sheldon,Yes. 
Sheldon,"You’re right, it can wait until morning. "
Sheldon,"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you’re in no state to talk."
Sheldon,I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. 
Sheldon,You could have told her the truth.
Sheldon,Is that a relevant factor? 
Sheldon,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. 
Sheldon,"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I’d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
Sheldon,Why? 
Sheldon,I was not aware of that. 
Sheldon,"Oh, alright. Leonard."
Sheldon,"When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight. "
Sheldon,….. 
Sheldon,"I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse."
Sheldon,"Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. "
Sheldon,"Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. "
Sheldon, Good morning.
Sheldon,"Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
Sheldon,Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
Sheldon,"Yes, well, he lied."
Sheldon,"He lied, and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it."
Sheldon,Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit. 
Sheldon,To help you. 
Sheldon,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me. "
Sheldon,"Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention. "
Sheldon,"Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important. "
Sheldon,"Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. "
Sheldon,"No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee. "
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web. "
Sheldon,"Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
Sheldon,"Ah, because it’s in Long Beach, and I don’t drive. "
Sheldon,"No, of course not, there’s no cousin Leo, there’s no intervention, focus Leonard."
Sheldon,"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
Sheldon,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
Sheldon,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
Sheldon,"That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. "
Sheldon,Un-unravelable. 
Sheldon,"Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."
Sheldon,"Okay, sure. I don’t see a problem with that. "
Sheldon,Good for you. 
Sheldon,Break a leg. 
Sheldon,"It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. "
Sheldon,"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy."
Sheldon,"No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie. "
Sheldon,"Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
Sheldon,Because Leo is a middle child. 
Sheldon,"You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
Sheldon,"Great, what is it?"
Sheldon,Fine.  We’ll talk in the morning.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
Sheldon,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you. "
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT."
Sheldon,"Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
Sheldon,"No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
Sheldon,"Subtextually, of course.  Morning Penny."
Sheldon,"Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab. "
Sheldon,"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour."
Sheldon,Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Sheldon,There have been studies.
Sheldon,"How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. "
Sheldon,Your parents made the right decision. 
Sheldon,"He’s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
Sheldon,Checkmate.
Sheldon,"Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. "
Sheldon,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. 
Sheldon,From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. 
Sheldon,Sick? 
Sheldon,"I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
Sheldon,"Friday, was that morning or afternoon? "
Sheldon,"Think woman, who blew their nose and when? "
Sheldon,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. "
Sheldon,"Thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. 
Sheldon,"I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat."
Sheldon,Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat. 
Sheldon,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies. 
Sheldon,"When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. "
Sheldon,Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.
Sheldon,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
Sheldon,"No, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
Sheldon,It’s right here on the bottom. 
Sheldon,"Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!"
Sheldon,"Leonard, where are you? "
Sheldon,At six-thirty in the morning? 
Sheldon,On Sunday? 
Sheldon,Why? 
Sheldon,"Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring."
Sheldon,"Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. "
Sheldon,"No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. "
Sheldon,What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
Sheldon,I want soup.
Sheldon,We don’t have soup. 
Sheldon,Is that a dog?
Sheldon,In the lab?
Sheldon,"Howard, I’m sick. "
Sheldon,I need soup.
Sheldon,"I’m sick, thank you very much. "
Sheldon,You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed! 
Sheldon,I want soup.
Sheldon,"Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?"
Sheldon,"I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for. "
Sheldon,"Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
Sheldon,Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
Sheldon,Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green? 
Sheldon,Thanks for bringing me home. 
Sheldon,Good. Good.
Sheldon,"Wait, where are you going? "
Sheldon,You’re going to leave me? 
Sheldon,"Well, of course, but, not by myself. "
Sheldon,"Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany."
Sheldon,"No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. "
Sheldon,"No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. "
Sheldon,"It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”"
Sheldon,"Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
Sheldon,"Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. "
Sheldon,Agreed. 
Sheldon,Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest. 
Sheldon,Vaporub makes my hands smell funny. 
Sheldon,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
Sheldon,"No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. "
Sheldon,Can you sing “Soft Kitty”. 
Sheldon,My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
Sheldon,"I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you. "
Sheldon,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing. 
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m hungry!"
Sheldon,I want grilled cheese. 
Sheldon,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us? 
Sheldon,I’m very congested. 
Sheldon,"Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
Sheldon,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl. "
Sheldon,Here’s the problem with teleportation.
Sheldon,"Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
Sheldon,"Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."
Sheldon,"No, he would be exactly the same. "
Sheldon,"So, you see it too."
Sheldon,"Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
Sheldon,"You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. "
Sheldon,I sense a disturbance in the force. 
Sheldon,"He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office."
Sheldon,Nope. Goodbye. 
Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. "
Sheldon,"Keen observation, goodbye. "
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,Get him out. 
Sheldon,You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it? 
Sheldon,Get him out Leonard.
Sheldon,"Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. "
Sheldon,Fourteen and a half.
Sheldon,"Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy."
Sheldon,"Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me."
Sheldon,"Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. "
Sheldon,"Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. "
Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything. "
Sheldon,"Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. "
Sheldon,Hey.
Sheldon,I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over. 
Sheldon,"But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on."
Sheldon,"So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you."
Sheldon,"What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
Sheldon,No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
Sheldon,Are you sure? 
Sheldon,"Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
Sheldon,Alright.
Sheldon,"If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going. "
Sheldon,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
Sheldon,"Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today? "
Sheldon,"Really, how does it work?"
Sheldon,"Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf? "
Sheldon,"Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
Sheldon,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. "
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that? 
Sheldon,Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.
Sheldon,Curiouser and curiouser. 
Sheldon,"No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting."
Sheldon,"Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. "
Sheldon,"You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. "
Sheldon,The Jewish people.
Sheldon,"We’ll make it nice, put out a spread. "
Sheldon,"Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you."
Sheldon,"I really don’t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
Sheldon,We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. 
Sheldon,Said Pharoah to Moses. 
Sheldon,"Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me. "
Sheldon,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
Sheldon,"Screw him, he was weak. "
Sheldon,"Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it’s an extremely private matter."
Sheldon,Well count me out.
Sheldon,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? 
Sheldon,"By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."
Sheldon,"No, don’t. "
Sheldon,"Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it. "
Sheldon,"I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
Sheldon,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. "
Sheldon,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. "
Sheldon,I will yield.
Sheldon,He does. 
Sheldon,Of course. 
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
Sheldon,"But I answered, it’s called teamwork. "
Sheldon,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal.  
Sheldon,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.
Sheldon,Why? 
Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Sheldon,"The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them? "
Sheldon,"Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD. "
Sheldon,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
Sheldon,"Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. "
Sheldon,Army Ants. 
Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
Sheldon,"Oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,No you didn’t.
Sheldon,"Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet. "
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
Sheldon,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
Sheldon,You’re welcome. One more thing.
Sheldon,"It’s on, bitch. "
Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
Sheldon,Leslie Winkle? 
Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. "
Sheldon,Formal protest.
Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is Technetium."
Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
Sheldon,Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N 
Sheldon,A sigma particle.
Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
Sheldon,"Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
Sheldon,"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!"
Sheldon,Well it’s not what he said.
Sheldon,I want a different question.
Sheldon,Formal protest.
Sheldon,Informal protest.
Sheldon,No. I decline to provide one.
Sheldon,That’s your opinion.
Sheldon,I don’t understand the question. 
Sheldon,Who?
Sheldon,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. "
Sheldon,Who?
Sheldon,Alright that is very immature.
Sheldon,Absolutely.
Sheldon,William Shatner.
Sheldon,Then it’s got to be Patrick Stewart. 
Sheldon,Formal protest. 
Sheldon,"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. 
Sheldon,"I know, it’s basic culinary science. "
Sheldon,You bid $800.
Sheldon,There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
Sheldon,"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. "
Sheldon,Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid. 
Sheldon,I understand why no-one else bid. 
Sheldon,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
Sheldon,"I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? "
Sheldon,"It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
Sheldon,Yeah. 
Sheldon,"Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. "
Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous. "
Sheldon,I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
Sheldon,"The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. "
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here. "
Sheldon,"Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. "
Sheldon,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? "
Sheldon,Then no. 
Sheldon,No. 
Sheldon,"Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too. "
Sheldon,"But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
Sheldon,"If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
Sheldon,Time machine. 
Sheldon,"Again, time machine. "
Sheldon,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. 
Sheldon,"Leonard, it’s two in the morning. "
Sheldon,So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
Sheldon,"You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. "
Sheldon,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. "
Sheldon,It won’t change the past. 
Sheldon,Are you upset about something? 
Sheldon,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
Sheldon,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me. 
Sheldon,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you? "
Sheldon,"Wow, I’m on fire tonight. "
Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
Sheldon,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. "
Sheldon,Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd. 
Sheldon,It’s still my turn.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. 
Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. 
Sheldon,"I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. "
Sheldon,Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war. 
Sheldon,"What’s the number, I’ll match it. "
Sheldon,What’s the exchange rate.
Sheldon,"Who cares, as long as you pick me. "
Sheldon,You hypocrite!
Sheldon,"Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! "
Sheldon,"It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.  "
Sheldon,We have to get rid of the time machine. 
Sheldon,"Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big. "
Sheldon,"Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!"
Sheldon,Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
Sheldon,Buddy.
Sheldon,"How can you be late, I wasn’t expecting you at all. "
Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard. "
Sheldon,"She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it."
Sheldon,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer? 
Sheldon,Rajesh. 
Sheldon,"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
Sheldon,"They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
Sheldon,"They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. "
Sheldon,No we don’t.
Sheldon,So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.
Sheldon,And don’t ever call me Shelly.
Sheldon,What just happened?
Sheldon,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. 
Sheldon,Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
Sheldon,Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. 
Sheldon,"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
Sheldon,I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? "
Sheldon,"I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
Sheldon,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
Sheldon,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. "
Sheldon,"I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
Sheldon,"Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought. "
Sheldon,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways. "
Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.
Sheldon,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. "
Sheldon,"You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me. "
Sheldon,"Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister. "
Sheldon,"You’re out too, by the way."
Sheldon,"It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. "
Sheldon,"Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. "
Sheldon,How so?
Sheldon,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
Sheldon,"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. "
Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. 
Sheldon,Oops. 
Sheldon,Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   
Sheldon,"Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
Sheldon,"Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. "
Sheldon,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. "
Sheldon,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. 
Sheldon,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended. "
Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal. 
Sheldon,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. "
Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. 
Sheldon,I weep for humanity. 
Sheldon,"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. "
Sheldon,"Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. "
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?
Sheldon,I’m a theoretical physicist.
Sheldon,What’s the difference?
Sheldon,"My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. "
Sheldon,"We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf."
Sheldon,"He can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant. "
Sheldon,What about the cream cheese frosting.
Sheldon,"For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. "
Sheldon,"It’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. "
Sheldon,"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it. "
Sheldon,"What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I’m aware of, and you know I don’t care for chit-chat. "
Sheldon,"Well alright, but I don’t see this as a promising endeavour."
Sheldon,"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party."
Sheldon,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. 
Sheldon,"Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. "
Sheldon,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. "
Sheldon,In addition I really don’t think that Leonard wants a…
Sheldon,"You can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint."
Sheldon,"Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party."
Sheldon,That’s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. 
Sheldon,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators. 
Sheldon,"Possibly, but unverified."
Sheldon,Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. 
Sheldon,That’s because I didn’t bring one.
Sheldon,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
Sheldon,"Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? "
Sheldon,"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion."
Sheldon,Oh. Fair enough. 
Sheldon,"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. "
Sheldon,"Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. "
Sheldon,"You mean, like a sweater? "
Sheldon,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
Sheldon,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner."
Sheldon,"Something he wouldn’t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router. "
Sheldon,What do you think.
Sheldon,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
Sheldon,"He doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch "
Sheldon,Why? 
Sheldon,"Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift, I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. "
Sheldon,"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. "
Sheldon,"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike. "
Sheldon,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? 
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,Huh? 
Sheldon,"Yeah, I suppose. "
Sheldon,I know everything about this stuff.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
Sheldon,It depends on what Bus you have.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord."
Sheldon,"Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, I’ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?"
Sheldon,"Okay, we don’t have that in stock, but I can special order it for you."
Sheldon,"Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. "
Sheldon,Why? 
Sheldon,"Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. "
Sheldon,Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
Sheldon,Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. 
Sheldon,That’s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
Sheldon,How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. 
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,Mai du lui tsa.
Sheldon,"My apologies Leonard, I’m only as good as my teacher. "
Sheldon,I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. 
Sheldon,"Okay, where were we? "
Sheldon,"Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk. "
Sheldon,I’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
Sheldon,"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply. "
Sheldon,"Howard, I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people. "
Sheldon,"I like tangerine chicken, I’m not getting tangerine chicken."
Sheldon,"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. "
Sheldon,"I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken. "
Sheldon,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…"
Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear? 
Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
Sheldon,"Yes, I suppose he is. "
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  "
Sheldon,We’re not done? 
Sheldon,"Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway. "
Sheldon,"Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit. "
Sheldon,"There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
Sheldon,"No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. "
Sheldon,"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. "
Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
Sheldon,Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? 
Sheldon,"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! "
Sheldon,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. "
Sheldon,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
Sheldon,It’s a common mistake.
Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat. 
Sheldon,"Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat. "
Sheldon,"No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
Sheldon,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. "
Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
Sheldon,"Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is. "
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…"
Sheldon,"I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
Sheldon,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you’ll have to narrow it down. "
Sheldon,Then don’t.
Sheldon,Other people might be interested. 
Sheldon,I assumed you would. 
Sheldon,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. "
Sheldon,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. "
Sheldon,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. "
Sheldon,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
Sheldon,Schrodinger’s Cat.
Sheldon,"You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.  "
Sheldon,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. "
Sheldon,"Oh, even I know that’s lame. "
Sheldon,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. "
Sheldon,"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. "
Sheldon,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates. "
Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? "
Sheldon,"I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it. "
Sheldon,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. "
Sheldon,"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. "
Sheldon,That depends.
Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? 
Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon? 
Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
Sheldon,"Yeah, but you were neither. "
Sheldon,You’re asking me to keep a secret?
Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. "
Sheldon,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. "
Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
Sheldon,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
Sheldon,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? "
Sheldon,"I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman."
Sheldon,Sure.  I’m Batman. See.
Sheldon,"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.  "
Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
Sheldon,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. "
Sheldon,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.  
Sheldon,"There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard."
Sheldon,I said Good Day! 
Sheldon,Why don’t you take a minute to decide  I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
Sheldon,"I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. "
Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
Sheldon,There doesn’t have to be a reason. 
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler. "
Sheldon,"If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack. "
Sheldon,It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. 
Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? "
Sheldon,"Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains. "
Sheldon,This is a very old building. 
Sheldon,Uh-oh.
Sheldon,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
Sheldon,"I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it. "
Sheldon,"I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. "
Sheldon,"Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit. "
Sheldon,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema. "
Sheldon,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. 
Sheldon,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
Sheldon,"No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. "
Sheldon,"Now, only if you want to."
Sheldon,Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving. 
Sheldon,She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
Sheldon,"Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether."
Sheldon,"That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…"
Sheldon,"I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though."
Sheldon,"But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel…."
Sheldon,"Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud. "
Sheldon,I’m ba-ack!
Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
Sheldon,I promised Penny. 
Sheldon,That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
Sheldon,"Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad. "
Sheldon,I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
Sheldon,"Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard. "
Sheldon,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard. 
Sheldon,I drank milk that tasted funny. 
Sheldon,"I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows. "
Sheldon,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
Sheldon,"It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
Sheldon,Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Sheldon,Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
Sheldon,Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
Sheldon,"That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
Sheldon,You’re wearing modern underwear?
Sheldon,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
Sheldon,"Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases."
Sheldon,"Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
Sheldon,Oh no.
Sheldon,"Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
Sheldon,You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
Sheldon,You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
Sheldon,"If we were, the food would be better."
Sheldon,"Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
Sheldon,"Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me."
Sheldon,Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
Sheldon,"You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school."
Sheldon,"But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia."
Sheldon,"Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier."
Sheldon,"Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
Sheldon,"Well, statistically speaking…"
Sheldon,"Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?"
Sheldon,You want me to leave the apartment?
Sheldon,You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
Sheldon,"Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too."
Sheldon,Well alright then.
Sheldon,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
Sheldon,"I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date."
Sheldon,Alone?
Sheldon,"What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre."
Sheldon,No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
Sheldon,What do they have?
Sheldon,Pastries such as bearclaws?
Sheldon,I don’t like bearclaws.
Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?"
Sheldon,Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
Sheldon,"Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you."
Sheldon,I have to make pee-pee.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair."
Sheldon,I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Sheldon,You mean like Spock?
Sheldon,Fascinating.
Sheldon,"If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology."
Sheldon,"It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,"Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?"
Sheldon,"Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?"
Sheldon,I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
Sheldon,Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
Sheldon,"Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel."
Sheldon,"Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research."
Sheldon,She called me dumbass.
Sheldon,"Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard."
Sheldon,"No, that response is unacceptable to me."
Sheldon,Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
Sheldon,I’m sorry.
Sheldon,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
Sheldon,"Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?"
Sheldon,Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
Sheldon,"Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie."
Sheldon,"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun."
Sheldon,"I’m listening, amuse me."
Sheldon,Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Sheldon,"I hope so, it was a snort of derision."
Sheldon,Look on the bright side.
Sheldon,Only nine more months to comic-con.
Sheldon,"Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading."
Sheldon,That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
Sheldon,"Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
Sheldon,"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
Sheldon,Alright then.  
Sheldon,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
Sheldon,"Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
Sheldon,"Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein."
Sheldon,"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
Sheldon,And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
Sheldon,There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
Sheldon,Alright then.  
Sheldon,Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
Sheldon,Make yourself comfortable.  Sheldor is back online.
Sheldon,The Conqueror.
Sheldon,"AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian."
Sheldon,"Sheldor, back online."
Sheldon,AFK. Away from keyboard.
Sheldon,What does that stand for?
Sheldon,"Yes, but what does it stand for?"
Sheldon,Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
Sheldon,"Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
Sheldon,"It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure."
Sheldon,"You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
Sheldon,"Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
Sheldon,Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.
Sheldon,"They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
Sheldon,Do you have the enchanted sword?
Sheldon,"You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
Sheldon,"Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?"
Sheldon,"No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme. "
Sheldon,"You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny."
Sheldon,"There you go, one enchanted sword."
Sheldon,That girl needs to get a life.
Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
Sheldon,You’re in my bedroom.
Sheldon,People can’t be in my bedroom.
Sheldon,I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
Sheldon,I spilled grape juice.
Sheldon,"I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
Sheldon,You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
Sheldon,"Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
Sheldon,"I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
Sheldon,No she doesn’t.
Sheldon,"Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
Sheldon,"If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh, Penny!"
Sheldon,"God, no."
Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
Sheldon,"Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home.  I’m not getting the computing time, am I?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too."
Sheldon,"Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
Sheldon,"I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do."
Sheldon,"I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to do this."
Sheldon,She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.
Sheldon,"Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
Sheldon,"Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
Sheldon,Would you like to be?
Sheldon,Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
Sheldon,"There, problem solved."
Sheldon,Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
Sheldon,"I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
Sheldon,Right. 22. 
Sheldon,What happened to the rest of your group?
Sheldon,Frenzy stance.
Sheldon,"So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
Sheldon,These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.
Sheldon,Drink a healing potion.
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
Sheldon,"Oh yes, it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
Sheldon,Good to know. Big old five.
Sheldon,"Leonard, this is Tom."
Sheldon,"Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny."
Sheldon,"Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
Sheldon,"No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit."
Sheldon,"Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
Sheldon,I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she’s a big old five.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I’d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny."
Sheldon,Can we talk about this later.
Sheldon,"But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
Sheldon,I’ll tell you why.
Sheldon,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
Sheldon,Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
Sheldon,If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
Sheldon,I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
Sheldon,What people?
Sheldon,"Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
Sheldon,"In general, yes."
Sheldon,"Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?"
Sheldon,"Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino."
Sheldon,"Apologise, for what?"
Sheldon,I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
Sheldon,"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive."
Sheldon,"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
Sheldon,I had not considered that.
Sheldon,I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
Sheldon,But I’m not.
Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want me to do?"
Sheldon,Dr Gablehauser.
Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17."
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry. "
Sheldon,"He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?"
Sheldon,"Damn, this is hard.  "
Sheldon,Aaaah!
Sheldon,"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.  "
Sheldon,Now?
Sheldon,"There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. "
Sheldon,"I can make it, but I won’t."
Sheldon,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
Sheldon,Now?
Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
Sheldon,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
Sheldon,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,What took you so long?
Sheldon,Fine. 
Sheldon,I want you to check before you accept the order.
Sheldon,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
Sheldon,"Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
Sheldon,"That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers."
Sheldon,"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky."
Sheldon,"Yes, Lucky."
Sheldon,"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
Sheldon,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin."
Sheldon,"Yes, half eagle, half lion."
Sheldon,"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
Sheldon,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
Sheldon,"That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln."
Sheldon,"Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
Sheldon,He should share our love of technology.
Sheldon,"Good morning, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me."
Sheldon,"Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up."
Sheldon,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
Sheldon,Then you can drive. Let’s go.
Sheldon,You did.
Sheldon,I didn’t. Let’s go.
Sheldon,But how am I going to get to work?
Sheldon,I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
Sheldon,"I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus."
Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
Sheldon, Penny…
Sheldon,Leonard’s asleep.
Sheldon,"No, wait. You have to drive me to work."
Sheldon,"But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus."
Sheldon,Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
Sheldon,Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go."
Sheldon,Thank you for driving me to work.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on."
Sheldon,"Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
Sheldon,"If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine."
Sheldon,Is there a “check the check engine light light”?  O-o-o-oh!
Sheldon,"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
Sheldon,Of course not.
Sheldon,You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
Sheldon,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
Sheldon,"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?"
Sheldon,"The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?"
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?"
Sheldon,"All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
Sheldon,"Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics."
Sheldon,Okay. I’ll give it a shot. 
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home."
Sheldon,"Good, perfect timing."
Sheldon,"No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work."
Sheldon,"Now, how do you propose I get home?"
Sheldon,Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
Sheldon,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Sheldon,We had a difference of opinion.
Sheldon,"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?"
Sheldon,"Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets."
Sheldon,You want to go to pottery barn first?
Sheldon,"Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?  Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets."
Sheldon,Good morning.
Sheldon,"She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
Sheldon,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
Sheldon,Why Penny?
Sheldon,"Hold on, I have one condition."
Sheldon,We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
Sheldon,And Radio Shack.
Sheldon,And the comic book store.
Sheldon,"I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license."
Sheldon,I was otherwise engaged.
Sheldon,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
Sheldon,I’m actually more of a theorist.
Sheldon,Oh.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions."
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
Sheldon,"I don’t need your help, Penny."
Sheldon,"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
Sheldon,"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
Sheldon,But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
Sheldon,Aced it.
Sheldon,"Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?"
Sheldon,Ooh!
Sheldon,"Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz."
Sheldon,"You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
Sheldon,I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
Sheldon,"Click. Now, are there air bags?"
Sheldon,What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
Sheldon,"I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
Sheldon,No. I quit. 
Sheldon,"Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed."
Sheldon,"No, I’m not giving up, I never give up."
Sheldon,I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
Sheldon,"Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
Sheldon,"Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
Sheldon,"Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to."
Sheldon,"No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I know that now."
Sheldon,Homo Novus doesn’t know.
Sheldon,"Good morning, gentlemen."
Sheldon,You saw nothing! 
Sheldon,"In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard."
Sheldon,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person."
Sheldon,That is the prevailing opinion.
Sheldon,"Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
Sheldon,The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
Sheldon,It’s what I do.
Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
Sheldon,I do eat dinner.
Sheldon,I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
Sheldon,"Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
Sheldon,"That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace."
Sheldon,What a nice girl.
Sheldon,Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Sheldon,Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
Sheldon,My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Not in these pants.
Sheldon,"Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
Sheldon,Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
Sheldon,Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
Sheldon,"You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte."
Sheldon,"Oh, good one."
Sheldon,"Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order."
Sheldon,Aren’t I?
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies."
Sheldon,"Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>"
Sheldon,He did.
Sheldon,"Me. Sorry, Leonard."
Sheldon,You heard her. How can I argue with me?
Sheldon,I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
Sheldon,He does on Wednesdays.
Sheldon,He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
Sheldon,Drat.
Sheldon,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  And then never ever watch it.
Sheldon,"Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her."
Sheldon,"I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
Sheldon,I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
Sheldon,Hide me.
Sheldon,I formally request sanctuary.
Sheldon,"Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do."
Sheldon,It’s Morse code.
Sheldon,So we can communicate through the wall.
Sheldon,"Yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
Sheldon,It’s very simple. This is A  this is C…
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
Sheldon,"Never, that’s the problem. I need your help."
Sheldon,I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
Sheldon,Come on! Don’t nitpick!
Sheldon,"Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
Sheldon,"Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here."
Sheldon,Now! Do it!
Sheldon,Godzilla clause?
Sheldon,Rats.
Sheldon,And I could not have done it without you.
Sheldon,"It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?"
Sheldon,Who’s Nowitzki?
Sheldon,"Oh, you want me to share credit?"
Sheldon,Get out!
Sheldon,"Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler."
Sheldon,"Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
Sheldon,What a nice girl.
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll."
Sheldon,"More Pad Thai, please."
Sheldon,Just one more bite.
Sheldon,I’m just so… full.
Sheldon,"Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down."
Sheldon,Bilurrrbe.
Sheldon,What’s wrong with your TV?
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…"
Sheldon,…playing Klingon Boggle.
Sheldon,"All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please."
Sheldon,"All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!"
Sheldon,"Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun."
Sheldon,Is qochbe’ spelled with a ?
Sheldon,"All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?"
Sheldon,Is my hamburger medium well?
Sheldon,"Dill slices, not sweet?"
Sheldon,Individual relish packets?
Sheldon,Onion rings?
Sheldon,Extra breading?
Sheldon,What did they say?
Sheldon,Did you protest?
Sheldon,Vociferously?
Sheldon,"Well, then what took you so long?"
Sheldon,"Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?"
Sheldon,You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
Sheldon,But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
Sheldon,Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
Sheldon,Who touched my…
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike."
Sheldon,You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
Sheldon,"Yes, baseball."
Sheldon,March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
Sheldon,The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
Sheldon,"I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two."
Sheldon,"And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."
Sheldon,"Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else."
Sheldon,You’re sitting in my spot.
Sheldon,"Leonard, she’s in my spot."
Sheldon,"All right, that’s it. Strike three."
Sheldon,"No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon."
Sheldon,"Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Oh! Hello.
Sheldon,It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
Sheldon,What are you implying?
Sheldon,"No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night."
Sheldon,"Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken."
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,Your clothes?
Sheldon,Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
Sheldon,"You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?"
Sheldon,"When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!"
Sheldon,Apologize.
Sheldon,"Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."
Sheldon,I’ve done no stupid things.
Sheldon,"I am meeting you halfway, I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things."
Sheldon,"I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night."
Sheldon,Mwah-ha-ha.
Sheldon,Who is it?
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?"
Sheldon," I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,Well played.
Sheldon,Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
Sheldon,"Oh look, Saturn 3 is on."
Sheldon,How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
Sheldon,In what sense is that a compromise?
Sheldon,"Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock."
Sheldon,"It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Sheldon,"Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
Sheldon,Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
Sheldon,What did I do?
Sheldon,What happened?
Sheldon,"Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush."
Sheldon,Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
Sheldon,"Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V."
Sheldon,"No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
Sheldon,"All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?"
Sheldon,Where?
Sheldon,You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
Sheldon,So what exactly do you want us to do?
Sheldon,Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
Sheldon,"Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
Sheldon,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
Sheldon,Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
Sheldon,Snap what?
Sheldon,Why wasn’t that Plan A?
Sheldon,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
Sheldon,Is there some problem?
Sheldon,"All right, goodbye."
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,Who would ask me?
Sheldon,So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
Sheldon,"Leonard, a moment."
Sheldon,"If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?"
Sheldon,Are you going to the office?
Sheldon,Then how can I say it convincingly?
Sheldon,All right. Leonard went to  the office.
Sheldon,This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
Sheldon,See? Why don’t I believe you?
Sheldon,Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
Sheldon,Leonard is going to  the office.
Sheldon,"Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
Sheldon,"I don’t make the rules, Leonard."
Sheldon,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
Sheldon,"Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out."
Sheldon,"Penny, hello."
Sheldon,What is shaking?
Sheldon,"It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
Sheldon,I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
Sheldon,"All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
Sheldon,Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
Sheldon,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
Sheldon,"Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable."
Sheldon,The statement stands for itself.
Sheldon,"Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
Sheldon,"You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth."
Sheldon,"Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
Sheldon,"Fine, whatever works."
Sheldon,"Uh, peace out!"
Sheldon,"Well, this is very pleasant."
Sheldon,And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
Sheldon,"You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
Sheldon,Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
Sheldon,"Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?"
Sheldon,Really? That’s where I was born!
Sheldon,"I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter."
Sheldon,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
Sheldon,"No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
Sheldon,"I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down."
Sheldon,"To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
Sheldon,"You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy."
Sheldon,"Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
Sheldon,"We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job."
Sheldon,"It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats."
Sheldon,"My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, this is it."
Sheldon,"This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
Sheldon,"You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her."
Sheldon,"I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command."
Sheldon,Give me one good reason why not.
Sheldon,This is banana bread.
Sheldon,It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
Sheldon,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
Sheldon,How can you be sure?
Sheldon,"I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
Sheldon,"She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
Sheldon,"Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
Sheldon,Because?
Sheldon,"It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships."
Sheldon,"More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together."
Sheldon,"Well, why not?"
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
Sheldon,"So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
Sheldon,May I come in?
Sheldon,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
Sheldon,"So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?"
Sheldon,Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
Sheldon,"I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early."
Sheldon,"Oh, hi Stephanie."
Sheldon,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
Sheldon,I’m helping you with Stephanie.
Sheldon,"When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
Sheldon,"Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it."
Sheldon,"Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
Sheldon,"No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. "
Sheldon,Like a gladiator!
Sheldon,"FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there."
Sheldon,"What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
Sheldon,"Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
Sheldon,Watery?
Sheldon,"She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
Sheldon,"I had no choice, he cried in front of her."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el."
Sheldon,In which I am not an expert.
Sheldon,"If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win."
Sheldon,"Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
Sheldon,Is it a high-frequency whistle?
Sheldon,Then it must be a tumour.
Sheldon,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
Sheldon,"It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
Sheldon,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
Sheldon,"Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting."
Sheldon,"Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie."
Sheldon,"That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
Sheldon,"I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
Sheldon,"You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H."
Sheldon,"Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that."
Sheldon,"At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
Sheldon,It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
Sheldon,"Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
Sheldon,I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
Sheldon,See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
Sheldon,"In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying."
Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Leonard."
Sheldon,Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
Sheldon,What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
Sheldon,"Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
Sheldon,Like hippies.
Sheldon,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
Sheldon,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
Sheldon,"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
Sheldon,Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
Sheldon,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
Sheldon,"Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
Sheldon,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
Sheldon,Wha??
Sheldon,I knew it! What do I do?
Sheldon,For how…
Sheldon,"Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
Sheldon,Like what?
Sheldon,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
Sheldon,Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
Sheldon,Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
Sheldon,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
Sheldon,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
Sheldon,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
Sheldon,Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
Sheldon,It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
Sheldon,"No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia."
Sheldon,"In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree."
Sheldon,Wait! You bought me a present?
Sheldon,Why would you do such a thing?
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation."
Sheldon,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
Sheldon,"No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps."
Sheldon,"No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall."
Sheldon,Yes?  Did you forget your key?
Sheldon,I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
Sheldon,"I told you before, bears are terrifying."
Sheldon,That presupposes Penny is tense.
Sheldon,"No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
Sheldon,You put no thought into that.
Sheldon,"I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?"
Sheldon,"If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
Sheldon,"Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?"
Sheldon,"Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma."
Sheldon,"You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated."
Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very gracious.     Gentlemen."
Sheldon,"Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer."
Sheldon,"I should note I’m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin."
Sheldon,"To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy."
Sheldon,I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
Sheldon,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
Sheldon,Be right back.
Sheldon,"I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here."
Sheldon,Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
Sheldon,Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
Sheldon,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
Sheldon,"Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
Sheldon,"If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar."
Sheldon,His name is Monte.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
Sheldon,"Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment."
Sheldon,There are boundaries.
Sheldon,What do you mean?
Sheldon,We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
Sheldon,Make it so.
Sheldon,"We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight."
Sheldon,"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear."
Sheldon,You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
Sheldon,"Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
Sheldon,"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now."
Sheldon,"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power."
Sheldon,"Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
Sheldon,"He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death."
Sheldon,Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
Sheldon,Do it.
Sheldon,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  That’s new.
Sheldon,"Don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,"
Sheldon,"I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
Sheldon,"So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?"
Sheldon,"You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello."
Sheldon,Just a toy robot?
Sheldon,"First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…"
Sheldon,It is extracted from the plant…
Sheldon,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
Sheldon,"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
Sheldon,"Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
Sheldon,"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!"
Sheldon,What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
Sheldon,"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?"
Sheldon,Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
Sheldon,First warning.
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,"It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do."
Sheldon,"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."
Sheldon,"Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
Sheldon,"You got it, buddy."
Sheldon,Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
Sheldon,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing."
Sheldon,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
Sheldon,How could I not?
Sheldon,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I’d have better luck making friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please."
Sheldon,"Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
Sheldon,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
Sheldon,I don’t see how you could.
Sheldon,What do you mean!?
Sheldon,I did learn how to swim.
Sheldon,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
Sheldon,"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists."
Sheldon,That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
Sheldon,You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
Sheldon,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
Sheldon,Family or friend?
Sheldon,"Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void.  It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
Sheldon,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
Sheldon,Oh! I love trains!
Sheldon,Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
Sheldon,Oh I do like monkeys!
Sheldon,"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?"
Sheldon,I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
Sheldon,"Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon."
Sheldon,We were really hitting it off.
Sheldon,Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
Sheldon,"See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
Sheldon,It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
Sheldon,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that."
Sheldon,"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing."
Sheldon,"You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink."
Sheldon,"This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
Sheldon,"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
Sheldon,"Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud."
Sheldon,"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming."
Sheldon,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
Sheldon,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
Sheldon,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I don’t think I can."
Sheldon,"No, that doesn’t seem any more likely."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out."
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner."
Sheldon,D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
Sheldon,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
Sheldon,"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe."
Sheldon,"Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays."
Sheldon,"No. You, too, are safe."
Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?"
Sheldon,"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj."
Sheldon,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
Sheldon,No? But we’re friends!
Sheldon,I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
Sheldon,"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys."
Sheldon,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
Sheldon,"Right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
Sheldon,"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add."
Sheldon,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
Sheldon,"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that."
Sheldon,"They’re right, it was the only option."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t specify."
Sheldon,"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."
Sheldon,"If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago."
Sheldon,"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
Sheldon,Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
Sheldon,That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
Sheldon,I’m never silly. Here.
Sheldon,Don’t you need money?
Sheldon,This is money I’m not using.
Sheldon,"My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some."
Sheldon,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
Sheldon,I sincerely hope so.
Sheldon,Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
Sheldon,Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
Sheldon,"You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
Sheldon,Ask me why.
Sheldon,Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
Sheldon,"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched."
Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
Sheldon,Was that sarca..
Sheldon,"Penny, you appear to have a package here."
Sheldon,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Dinner’s here."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
Sheldon,"In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can."
Sheldon,Outside? I just made cocoa.
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
Sheldon,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
Sheldon,"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us."
Sheldon,They did.
Sheldon,"They had a terrible time of it, Leonard."
Sheldon,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
Sheldon,You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
Sheldon,I remember him.
Sheldon,I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
Sheldon,"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.  "
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
Sheldon,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature."
Sheldon,"That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
Sheldon,"This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
Sheldon,"He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
Sheldon,"Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy."
Sheldon,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
Sheldon,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
Sheldon,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
Sheldon,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
Sheldon,Aw…
Sheldon,What a remarkable woman.
Sheldon,I envy you your childhood.
Sheldon,"You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts."
Sheldon,"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
Sheldon,"It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location."
Sheldon,Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
Sheldon,You went to the comic book store without me.7
Sheldon,I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
Sheldon,I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
Sheldon,"Oh, I can’t believe that."
Sheldon,My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
Sheldon,Can I make you a cup of tea?
Sheldon,I feel very comfortable around you.
Sheldon,"It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
Sheldon,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
Sheldon,I’d like to do the math.
Sheldon,"So, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together."
Sheldon,"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying."
Sheldon,"You see right through me, don’t you?"
Sheldon,"The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids."
Sheldon,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
Sheldon,And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
Sheldon,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us."
Sheldon,"Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!"
Sheldon,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
Sheldon,"Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine."
Sheldon,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
Sheldon,"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat."
Sheldon,"No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done."
Sheldon,Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
Sheldon,"My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
Sheldon,"No, I’m going to the comic book store."
Sheldon,What difference does it make?
Sheldon,"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
Sheldon,I’m not unhappy.
Sheldon,Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
Sheldon,Koothrappali picked me up.
Sheldon,They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
Sheldon,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong."
Sheldon,I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
Sheldon,Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
Sheldon,"That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?"
Sheldon,"You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner."
Sheldon,Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
Sheldon,"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
Sheldon,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
Sheldon,"From that key maker, I highly doubt it."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
Sheldon,Nope.
Sheldon,More?
Sheldon,Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
Sheldon,What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
Sheldon,"No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."
Sheldon,"But. Oh, this changes everything."
Sheldon,What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,I still don’t like this cushion.
Sheldon,"Right, just one thing before we start."
Sheldon,That was for my cushion.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."
Sheldon,She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
Sheldon,"Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy "
Sheldon,"Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right."
Sheldon,"But once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
Sheldon,"I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
Sheldon,"George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
Sheldon,It’s like talking to a chimp.
Sheldon,"We’re not flying, we’re taking the train."
Sheldon,"Don’t say it like that, Leonard, say it like: we’re taking the train!"
Sheldon,"Oh, I always enjoy that, but I’m a little busy."
Sheldon,"I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
Sheldon,"Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
Sheldon,I don’t follow.
Sheldon,"Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
Sheldon,What on earth are you doing?
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
Sheldon,"Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
Sheldon,"He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction."
Sheldon,"Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!"
Sheldon,Whee!
Sheldon,I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…"
Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Sheldon,I forgot my flash drive.
Sheldon,So we have to go back.
Sheldon,You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
Sheldon,It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
Sheldon,Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
Sheldon,"You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive "
Sheldon,"Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train."
Sheldon,Are you going to be sarcastic?
Sheldon,But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
Sheldon,The key is hidden in my room.
Sheldon,Penny would have to go into my room.
Sheldon,People don’t go in my room!
Sheldon,"Oh, I hate when that happens."
Sheldon,"Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
Sheldon,It’s Sheldon.
Sheldon,I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
Sheldon,"What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…"
Sheldon,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom."
Sheldon,"No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
Sheldon,"All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right"
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
Sheldon,That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
Sheldon,Don’t read those letters!
Sheldon,Put down the letters!
Sheldon,I’m back.
Sheldon,Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
Sheldon,"You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click."
Sheldon,"No, it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?"
Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
Sheldon,"So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top."
Sheldon,"Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva."
Sheldon,"Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit."
Sheldon,– Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
Sheldon,"So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,It’s eleven am.
Sheldon,This package came while you were at work.
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Sheldon,You have to sign this.
Sheldon,"When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable."
Sheldon,"Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?"
Sheldon,"Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
Sheldon,"Obviously, not a cleaning business."
Sheldon,Good for you. Sign here.
Sheldon,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
Sheldon,What’s her name?
Sheldon,And you’re going to let her handle my food?
Sheldon,I think you’re just making that up.
Sheldon,Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
Sheldon,How many of these can you make a day?
Sheldon,And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
Sheldon,"No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
Sheldon,Before taxes.
Sheldon,"I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
Sheldon,"Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
Sheldon,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
Sheldon,Of course I could.
Sheldon,"Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance."
Sheldon,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
Sheldon,And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
Sheldon,Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
Sheldon,Sarcasm. Good-bye.
Sheldon,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
Sheldon,"That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day."
Sheldon,There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
Sheldon,You’re questioning my math?
Sheldon,Want me to show my work?
Sheldon,"All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course."
Sheldon,"That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now."
Sheldon,"You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead."
Sheldon,I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
Sheldon,"Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over. "
Sheldon,Hot glue.
Sheldon,"It won’t work, the flower’s too porous."
Sheldon,Intriguing.
Sheldon,"Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
Sheldon,"Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
Sheldon,Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
Sheldon,Wow.
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
Sheldon,It’s not my apartment.
Sheldon,– What’s wrong with it?
Sheldon,"Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go."
Sheldon,What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
Sheldon,Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
Sheldon,Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
Sheldon,"Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth."
Sheldon,"Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
Sheldon,We should get to work.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
Sheldon,"Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?"
Sheldon,"Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work."
Sheldon,I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
Sheldon,"Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!"
Sheldon,"Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know."
Sheldon,"No, I don’t drink coffee."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs."
Sheldon,I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
Sheldon,"You’re right, of course."
Sheldon,"Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother."
Sheldon,"Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…"
Sheldon,"No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
Sheldon,"Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
Sheldon,"Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,The horror!
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
Sheldon,The horror!
Sheldon,"No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not."
Sheldon,"I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
Sheldon,You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
Sheldon,"Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?"
Sheldon,"I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here."
Sheldon,I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
Sheldon,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
Sheldon,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
Sheldon,Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
Sheldon,"Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?"
Sheldon,I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
Sheldon,"If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
Sheldon,Alicia?
Sheldon,Welcome to the building.
Sheldon,"Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her."
Sheldon,You don’t jog.
Sheldon,"True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again."
Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Penny."
Sheldon,"Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”"
Sheldon,Come.
Sheldon,"Congratulations, I see you did your laundry."
Sheldon,How does one sort of…
Sheldon,He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
Sheldon,"In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo."
Sheldon,"It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious."
Sheldon,"Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. "
Sheldon,"Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm."
Sheldon,"You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
Sheldon,"You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
Sheldon,I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
Sheldon,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
Sheldon,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
Sheldon,"Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?"
Sheldon,"They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you."
Sheldon,You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
Sheldon,May I interject something here?
Sheldon,You got the wrong mustard.
Sheldon,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
Sheldon,"Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed."
Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
Sheldon,This is Thai food.
Sheldon,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
Sheldon,"Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Sheldon,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."
Sheldon,All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
Sheldon,"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Sheldon,"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"
Sheldon,Fascinating.
Sheldon,"To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
Sheldon,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
Sheldon,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man."
Sheldon,A superb choice.
Sheldon,"Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse."
Sheldon,Get her out of here.
Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
Sheldon,Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
Sheldon,"No, you!"
Sheldon,"Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
Sheldon,"Leonard, we need a ruling."
Sheldon,"Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
Sheldon,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"
Sheldon,"Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"
Sheldon,Are you ill?
Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
Sheldon,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?"
Sheldon,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
Sheldon,"Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
Sheldon,My original point.
Sheldon,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be."
Sheldon,"Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help."
Sheldon,"I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl."
Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
Sheldon,"Yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
Sheldon,Au contraire.
Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
Sheldon,"So, I win."
Sheldon,"So, I win."
Sheldon,"Darn tootin’, I win."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it."
Sheldon,"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that."
Sheldon,"I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
Sheldon,I don’t like this game.
Sheldon,"I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
Sheldon,I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
Sheldon,"You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
Sheldon,I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Hello, neighbour."
Sheldon,And how are you doing this fine evening?
Sheldon,Good. I’m glad.
Sheldon,"I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."
Sheldon,"Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today."
Sheldon,"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
Sheldon,"Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
Sheldon,"Oh, I shall.  No!"
Sheldon,We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
Sheldon,I left them in the bowl.
Sheldon,Where?
Sheldon,What’s it doing in my apartment?
Sheldon,You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
Sheldon,You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
Sheldon,Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
Sheldon,"Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense."
Sheldon,"So, how was your day?"
Sheldon,"No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat."
Sheldon,"Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess."
Sheldon,How can one person be a whole movie?
Sheldon,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
Sheldon,Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
Sheldon,"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
Sheldon,"Hmm, I see."
Sheldon,"I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl."
Sheldon,Can you?
Sheldon,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
Sheldon,Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
Sheldon,"I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…"
Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very helpful."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
Sheldon,"I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall."
Sheldon,"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head."
Sheldon,May I say one last thing.
Sheldon,Alright. Goodnight.
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,I can’t sleep. how are you going?
Sheldon,I’m homesick.
Sheldon,"Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far, far away."
Sheldon,Sing soft kitty.
Sheldon,Homesick is a type of being sick.
Sheldon,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
Sheldon,Sleepy kitty.
Sheldon,No. Start over.
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,Thank you for letting me stay here.
Sheldon,"Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re finally home."
Sheldon,"Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
Sheldon,"Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!"
Sheldon,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Sheldon,"Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, spoiler alert."
Sheldon,"You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
Sheldon,Said the Grinch to Christmas.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?"
Sheldon,"Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on."
Sheldon,You’re not going to answer it?
Sheldon,"You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
Sheldon,"We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know."
Sheldon,"Answer the phone, Leonard."
Sheldon,Aren’t you going to check your messages?
Sheldon,"You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
Sheldon,At times.
Sheldon,"Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?"
Sheldon,But the mission is for six months.
Sheldon,Have you notified NASA?
Sheldon,I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. "
Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry."
Sheldon,"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
Sheldon,"You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?"
Sheldon,It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
Sheldon,It won’t work. No way to mount it.
Sheldon,That could work.
Sheldon,You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
Sheldon,"If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
Sheldon,"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break."
Sheldon,Why does Leonard get to go?
Sheldon,"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree."
Sheldon,Fascinating.
Sheldon,"I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true."
Sheldon,"Oh, boy."
Sheldon,I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
Sheldon,Great restraint on my part.
Sheldon,Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
Sheldon,"You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
Sheldon,It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
Sheldon,"That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
Sheldon,"You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
Sheldon,"He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was."
Sheldon,Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
Sheldon,"Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle."
Sheldon,"Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”"
Sheldon,"Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?"
Sheldon,"I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go."
Sheldon,How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
Sheldon,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
Sheldon,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question."
Sheldon,It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
Sheldon,"Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…"
Sheldon,…the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
Sheldon,"Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
Sheldon,I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice."
Sheldon,"Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?"
Sheldon,"Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
Sheldon,"Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
Sheldon,No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
Sheldon,"I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
Sheldon,No. Did she seem upset to you?
Sheldon,"Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?"
Sheldon,Two for two. I’m on fire.
Sheldon,"That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time."
Sheldon,"Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle."
Sheldon,And begin.
Sheldon,Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
Sheldon,I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
Sheldon,"Here, drink slash eat this."
Sheldon,It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
Sheldon,"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
Sheldon,"Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick."
Sheldon,"That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
Sheldon,"I want a cookie, Meemaw."
Sheldon,But Meemaw just made cookies.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
Sheldon,"Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden."
Sheldon,"Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?"
Sheldon,What is it?
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
Sheldon,"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
Sheldon,She does have a short attention span.
Sheldon,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
Sheldon,"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!"
Sheldon,"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
Sheldon,It is remarkable.
Sheldon,What are we having?
Sheldon,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
Sheldon,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
Sheldon,"Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
Sheldon,Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
Sheldon,Three months. This is gonna be great!
Sheldon,"I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half."
Sheldon,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet.  Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
Sheldon,"Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye.  Daddy’s home."
Sheldon,"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions."
Sheldon,"Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
Sheldon,Tell me what?
Sheldon,"You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
Sheldon,"If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
Sheldon,"If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
Sheldon,So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D."
Sheldon,You tampered with my experiment?
Sheldon,Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
Sheldon,Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
Sheldon,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Sheldon,"What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
Sheldon,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
Sheldon,"Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
Sheldon,"You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
Sheldon,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
Sheldon,That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
Sheldon,I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
Sheldon,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
Sheldon,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
Sheldon,"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
Sheldon,I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
Sheldon,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
Sheldon,It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
Sheldon,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
Sheldon,"All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
Sheldon,My credibility may have been damaged…
Sheldon,"But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein."
Sheldon,"Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom."
Sheldon,"Aw, Mom."
Sheldon,Fed.
Sheldon,Bread.
Sheldon,Grateful.
Sheldon,Plateful.
Sheldon,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Sheldon,Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
Sheldon,They’re not my friends.
Sheldon,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
Sheldon,What are they doing here?
Sheldon,"Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
Sheldon,I forgive you. Let’s go home.
Sheldon,"Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?"
Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Sheldon,I did.
Sheldon,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
Sheldon,"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
Sheldon,Tandoori Palace?
Sheldon,"You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
Sheldon,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
Sheldon,I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
Sheldon,"If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
Sheldon,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
Sheldon,"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat."
Sheldon,"Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
Sheldon,"In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
Sheldon,"Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
Sheldon,"Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play."
Sheldon,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
Sheldon,I can’t take your money.
Sheldon,"I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
Sheldon,Thank God.
Sheldon,Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
Sheldon,"All right, you have a wager."
Sheldon,I don’t see anything.
Sheldon,One at a time.  What was that?
Sheldon,Help me open it.
Sheldon,"Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four."
Sheldon,Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
Sheldon,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
Sheldon,"Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here."
Sheldon,His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
Sheldon,"An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy."
Sheldon,"Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
Sheldon,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Sheldon,"Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
Sheldon,We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
Sheldon,"He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.  "
Sheldon,Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
Sheldon,"Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?"
Sheldon,I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
Sheldon,I’m sorry?
Sheldon,"No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?"
Sheldon,Told you.
Sheldon,"No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?"
Sheldon,"Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
Sheldon,"Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations."
Sheldon,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
Sheldon,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
Sheldon,"Penny, I’d rather not talk about it."
Sheldon,Why would that make me feel better?
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken."
Sheldon,A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
Sheldon,"Well, I wish I could."
Sheldon,Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
Sheldon,I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz."
Sheldon, Yes.
Sheldon,Hardly.
Sheldon,Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Sheldon,"Hmm. Oh, who cares?"
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."
Sheldon,The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
Sheldon,It’s Oatmeal Day.
Sheldon,"Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"
Sheldon,"Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast."
Sheldon,"It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
Sheldon,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
Sheldon,That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
Sheldon,I want oatmeal.
Sheldon,"I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal."
Sheldon,"I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”"
Sheldon,"What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible."
Sheldon,You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
Sheldon,"Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday."
Sheldon,"Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches."
Sheldon,"Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate"
Sheldon,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
Sheldon,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
Sheldon,"You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
Sheldon,"Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
Sheldon,Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
Sheldon,"And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
Sheldon,You’re here a lot now.
Sheldon,Thank you. Chocolate?
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,Very good. Chocolate?
Sheldon,"Actually, it turns out I can."
Sheldon,"There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
Sheldon,"I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
Sheldon,"Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
Sheldon,"Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
Sheldon,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
Sheldon,"No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
Sheldon,"You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
Sheldon,"No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
Sheldon,Come again?
Sheldon,Have a chocolate.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
Sheldon,Thank you. 
Sheldon,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
Sheldon,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
Sheldon,"Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
Sheldon,"Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
Sheldon,The parade.
Sheldon,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
Sheldon,You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
Sheldon,"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate."
Sheldon,"Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession."
Sheldon,And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj."
Sheldon,"Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
Sheldon,I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
Sheldon,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
Sheldon,"Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God."
Sheldon,I’m sorry.
Sheldon,"Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
Sheldon,And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
Sheldon,"That’s happy, right?"
Sheldon,Nailed it.
Sheldon,"Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?"
Sheldon,"I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
Sheldon,For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
Sheldon,For me.
Sheldon,Of course I’m busy.
Sheldon,"Yes, please.  How may I help you?"
Sheldon,For me.
Sheldon,"I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
Sheldon,I reject them all.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
Sheldon,Please.
Sheldon,"So, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
Sheldon,"Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
Sheldon,Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
Sheldon,"All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
Sheldon,I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
Sheldon,"This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,Top desk drawer.
Sheldon,Alright?
Sheldon,Good.
Sheldon,Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
Sheldon,Astro means star.
Sheldon,English is your native language.
Sheldon,There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
Sheldon,Caca?
Sheldon,"All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…"
Sheldon,"In this context, with me means for me."
Sheldon,"Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
Sheldon,You’re defacing my work.
Sheldon,Give me the eraser.
Sheldon,I said give it to me.
Sheldon,"Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!"
Sheldon,I am in every way.
Sheldon, Raj.
Sheldon,"Doing what?  All right, you’ve made your point."
Sheldon,I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
Sheldon,I didn’t say that.
Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me."
Sheldon,In this context for me could mean with me.
Sheldon,I reject them all.
Sheldon,"Wait, you have to drive me home."
Sheldon,I walked.
Sheldon,"I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles."
Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
Sheldon,"Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris."
Sheldon,"From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
Sheldon,"Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry."
Sheldon,"June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue."
Sheldon,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, no."
Sheldon,"Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. That’s the face napkin."
Sheldon,"I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
Sheldon,That would probably save us some time.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
Sheldon,I have money.
Sheldon,How does it different from the money I have?
Sheldon,Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
Sheldon,Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
Sheldon,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
Sheldon,But I must have it.
Sheldon,"Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
Sheldon,"You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
Sheldon,"I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure."
Sheldon,"My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
Sheldon,"In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him."
Sheldon,"From hell’s heart, I stab at thee."
Sheldon,My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
Sheldon,"Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!"
Sheldon,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
Sheldon,"So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed."
Sheldon,Silence!
Sheldon,"I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’"
Sheldon,Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
Sheldon,Luminescence spell.
Sheldon,Fire demon.
Sheldon,Three-headed lion.
Sheldon,Brimstone.
Sheldon,"You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
Sheldon,"The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
Sheldon,"You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge."
Sheldon,Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
Sheldon,"No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes."
Sheldon,I can’t.
Sheldon,"No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny."
Sheldon,I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!"
Sheldon,"Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
Sheldon,"Oh, that certainly would suck."
Sheldon,"Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line."
Sheldon,"Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
Sheldon,"You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
Sheldon,Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
Sheldon,Victory!
Sheldon,"Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
Sheldon,Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite."
Sheldon,It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
Sheldon,The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
Sheldon,"I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot."
Sheldon,"If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
Sheldon,Football or chicken-fried meats?
Sheldon,"If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
Sheldon,"That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life."
Sheldon,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
Sheldon,"That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
Sheldon,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
Sheldon,"Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
Sheldon,How would you put it?
Sheldon,"Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
Sheldon,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
Sheldon,What’s funny about Cylon toast?
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread."
Sheldon,"You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
Sheldon,"So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
Sheldon,You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
Sheldon,"I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
Sheldon,"Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
Sheldon,I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
Sheldon,"Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
Sheldon,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
Sheldon,"You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday."
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,"Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday."
Sheldon,"Your turn, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Roll the dice, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"
Sheldon,I’ll just roll for you.
Sheldon,Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
Sheldon,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
Sheldon,It’s also your roll.
Sheldon,Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
Sheldon,"Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
Sheldon,"Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car."
Sheldon,"It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?"
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."
Sheldon,"Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her."
Sheldon,Leonard! Stop the car!
Sheldon,I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
Sheldon,"Come on, come on, we’re late."
Sheldon,"I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
Sheldon,"Go, go, Power Rangers, go!"
Sheldon,"No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
Sheldon,"All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening."
Sheldon,"Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
Sheldon,Got it.
Sheldon,"Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon."
Sheldon,"This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
Sheldon,"No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
Sheldon,"I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here."
Sheldon,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch."
Sheldon,"I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
Sheldon,"Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
Sheldon,"You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
Sheldon,Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
Sheldon,Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard."
Sheldon,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
Sheldon,I don’t follow.
Sheldon,"All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong."
Sheldon,"Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
Sheldon,Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Sheldon,"Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
Sheldon,"That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
Sheldon,"Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
Sheldon,And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour."
Sheldon,Go apologize to Penny.
Sheldon,Right now would be good.
Sheldon,"Although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
Sheldon, Raj.
Sheldon,Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
Sheldon,"I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."
Sheldon,Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
Sheldon,I want that one.
Sheldon,"Can I get this comic book, too?"
Sheldon,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
Sheldon,"Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. "
Sheldon,"And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
Sheldon,"I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.."
Sheldon,Penny?
Sheldon, Penny..
Sheldon,Shall I come back at a better time?
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
Sheldon,Tubs are slippery.
Sheldon,I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
Sheldon,They’re holding umbrellas.
Sheldon,The ducks in my tub.
Sheldon,"They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
Sheldon,"Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so."
Sheldon,I don’t drive.
Sheldon,"Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
Sheldon,But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
Sheldon,All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
Sheldon,"Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
Sheldon,I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
Sheldon,My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
Sheldon,"That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving."
Sheldon,"Okay, here."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,We should have you checked for a concussion.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Don’t look?
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice."
Sheldon,They always look. It never ends well.
Sheldon,Ok.
Sheldon,It doesn’t feel like an arm.
Sheldon,All righty.
Sheldon,"For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
Sheldon,"Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
Sheldon,Didn’t work out well.
Sheldon,"One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
Sheldon,Where is the passenger side mirror?
Sheldon,"Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again."
Sheldon,"Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?"
Sheldon,"That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station."
Sheldon,All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
Sheldon,"Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
Sheldon,"No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
Sheldon,"Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks."
Sheldon,"All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury."
Sheldon,All right. And how did the accident occur?
Sheldon,"Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
Sheldon,Kidney disease?
Sheldon,Migraines?
Sheldon,Are you currently pregnant?
Sheldon,Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
Sheldon,When was your last menstrual period?
Sheldon,"I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
Sheldon,Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
Sheldon,"Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here."
Sheldon,"Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool."
Sheldon,Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
Sheldon,"That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it."
Sheldon,“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
Sheldon,"I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…"
Sheldon,"Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
Sheldon,My thank you was not sincere.
Sheldon,Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
Sheldon,"Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
Sheldon,"Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
Sheldon,"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
Sheldon,Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, may I interject?"
Sheldon,"Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
Sheldon,"Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
Sheldon,"My pleasure, Ira."
Sheldon,"Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
Sheldon,"A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!"
Sheldon,I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
Sheldon,What do you want?
Sheldon,It wasn’t funny.
Sheldon,Did you laugh?
Sheldon,I refuse to sink to his level.
Sheldon,I never admit defeat.
Sheldon,"However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
Sheldon,It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
Sheldon,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
Sheldon,"All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
Sheldon,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly."
Sheldon,"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
Sheldon,"You flatter me, sir."
Sheldon,"The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
Sheldon,"It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
Sheldon,There is no abort.
Sheldon,"I made a boo-boo, all right?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, she’s doing it again."
Sheldon,No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating."
Sheldon,"Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
Sheldon,Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
Sheldon,My mother was right. Hell is real.
Sheldon,"Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
Sheldon,Howard?
Sheldon,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
Sheldon,Bazinga. I don’t care.
Sheldon,That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
Sheldon,Just need a little more practice.
Sheldon,"It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again."
Sheldon,Then speak.
Sheldon,"All right.  Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy."
Sheldon,"A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
Sheldon,Why can’t Leonard teach you?
Sheldon,"Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
Sheldon,"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
Sheldon,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
Sheldon,The one with the frogs.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so."
Sheldon,"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
Sheldon,"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
Sheldon,"Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla."
Sheldon,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
Sheldon,"One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?"
Sheldon,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
Sheldon,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Sheldon,Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins."
Sheldon,"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?"
Sheldon,This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
Sheldon,"Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?"
Sheldon,Can’t you hold it?
Sheldon,"Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted."
Sheldon,"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?"
Sheldon,"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!"
Sheldon,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
Sheldon,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Sheldon,I’m sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Sheldon,"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
Sheldon,All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
Sheldon,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
Sheldon,Greece.
Sheldon,"There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?"
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Oh!
Sheldon,Why are you crying?
Sheldon,"That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
Sheldon,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
Sheldon,It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
Sheldon,A good question.
Sheldon,"And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
Sheldon,It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
Sheldon,"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
Sheldon,"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
Sheldon,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
Sheldon,"Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
Sheldon,"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
Sheldon,"I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why."
Sheldon,No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
Sheldon,I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
Sheldon,"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
Sheldon,"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
Sheldon,No trouble at all.
Sheldon,"My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
Sheldon,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
Sheldon,You did.
Sheldon,"Neither do I, but it’s the social convention."
Sheldon,It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
Sheldon,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…"
Sheldon,Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
Sheldon,"Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you."
Sheldon,September 22nd.
Sheldon,"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?"
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,I made tea.
Sheldon,I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
Sheldon,It’s a conversation starter.
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate."
Sheldon,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
Sheldon,"To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
Sheldon,That’s not the comforting part.
Sheldon,"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
Sheldon,"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
Sheldon,"If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night."
Sheldon,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
Sheldon,You’re very welcome.
Sheldon,I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
Sheldon,I blame Penny.
Sheldon,Agreed.
Sheldon,I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
Sheldon,Detailed analysis posted online.
Sheldon,"It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
Sheldon,"All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
Sheldon,"Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
Sheldon,The zoot suit riots.
Sheldon,I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
Sheldon,That’s a semantically null sentence.
Sheldon,"Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest."
Sheldon,"If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
Sheldon,"Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination."
Sheldon,"One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland."
Sheldon,You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
Sheldon,"Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge."
Sheldon,"Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
Sheldon,"Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles."
Sheldon,Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
Sheldon,What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
Sheldon,I don’t drink.
Sheldon,I would like a root beer float.
Sheldon,"They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."
Sheldon,And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
Sheldon,All right. There’s a female.
Sheldon,But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
Sheldon,Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
Sheldon,Okay. What is your game?
Sheldon,"When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
Sheldon,It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
Sheldon,I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
Sheldon,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. 
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
Sheldon,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
Sheldon,We scored. I’m the wingman.
Sheldon,The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet.  One minute. Sis  n.
Sheldon,"It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish."
Sheldon,I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again."
Sheldon,"Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
Sheldon,"Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years."
Sheldon,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
Sheldon,Hulk sad.
Sheldon,"You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late."
Sheldon,Time for bed.
Sheldon,"Good night, puny human! ."
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu."
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken."
Sheldon,"Yes, General Tso."
Sheldon,"So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?"
Sheldon,"Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
Sheldon,Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
Sheldon,It was listed under seafood.
Sheldon,"Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
Sheldon,The TV is gone.
Sheldon,"Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books."
Sheldon,"They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii."
Sheldon,"Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."
Sheldon,When does the CSI team get here?
Sheldon,"In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
Sheldon,"Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
Sheldon,The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
Sheldon,"Oh, how I wish I could."
Sheldon,I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,"We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
Sheldon,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
Sheldon,"All right, then. Good night."
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
Sheldon,May I come in?
Sheldon,I see you’re drinking wine.
Sheldon,Uh-huh.
Sheldon,"Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
Sheldon,"It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
Sheldon,I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
Sheldon,"Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?"
Sheldon,All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
Sheldon,Bad idea.
Sheldon,"Listen to her, Jim."
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny!
Sheldon,What if they cut the power?
Sheldon,What if someone steals my keys?
Sheldon,"What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
Sheldon,Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
Sheldon,Better.
Sheldon,"Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Leonard and Penny."
Sheldon,I heard a noise.
Sheldon,Why would you knock over a lamp?
Sheldon,"Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. "
Sheldon,Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
Sheldon,Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
Sheldon,"And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?"
Sheldon,"Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss."
Sheldon,I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
Sheldon,My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
Sheldon,"Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting."
Sheldon,"Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid."
Sheldon,"All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?"
Sheldon,"It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail."
Sheldon,"I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there."
Sheldon,I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
Sheldon,They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
Sheldon,"Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video."
Sheldon,"That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!"
Sheldon,"Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce.  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please."
Sheldon,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
Sheldon,I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
Sheldon,Is it morning?
Sheldon,Then I’ve been up all night.
Sheldon,Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Sheldon,"Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
Sheldon,I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
Sheldon,"You’re right.  It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you."
Sheldon,"Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
Sheldon,Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
Sheldon,"Structure, constant structure. One atom…"
Sheldon,"Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
Sheldon,"Not lima beans, carbon atoms."
Sheldon,"Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons."
Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
Sheldon,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
Sheldon,Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
Sheldon,The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
Sheldon,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?"
Sheldon,"I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
Sheldon,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
Sheldon,Impaired cognitive function.
Sheldon,But I don’t want to go to bed.
Sheldon,"Oh, all right."
Sheldon,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Sheldon,"Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms."
Sheldon,But I’m still working.
Sheldon,"You can try, but you’ll never catch me. "
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,I have good news.
Sheldon,Your cell phone was off.
Sheldon,"And that didn’t work out, did it?"
Sheldon,I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
Sheldon,"No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
Sheldon,Einstein.
Sheldon,Albert Einstein.
Sheldon,"When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
Sheldon,"Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
Sheldon,Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
Sheldon,"No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard."
Sheldon,A menial job. Like yours.
Sheldon,"I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"
Sheldon,Shouldn’t you check your database?
Sheldon,You didn’t really type.
Sheldon,"Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
Sheldon,I could do that.
Sheldon,One question.
Sheldon,What’s sheetrock?
Sheldon,That seems acceptable.
Sheldon,I don’t drive.
Sheldon,"Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
Sheldon,I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
Sheldon,"A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am."
Sheldon,"Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way."
Sheldon,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
Sheldon,"You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."
Sheldon,"All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,Nope.
Sheldon,Yep.
Sheldon,I do.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
Sheldon,"Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
Sheldon,"In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
Sheldon,"Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
Sheldon,"Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize."
Sheldon,In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
Sheldon,"This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing."
Sheldon,"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
Sheldon,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
Sheldon,What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Sheldon,But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Sheldon,Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
Sheldon,Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
Sheldon,"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny."
Sheldon,"Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland."
Sheldon,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
Sheldon,"Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
Sheldon,"He can’t kill me, even if I turn."
Sheldon,"No, that seemed a little farfetched."
Sheldon,"I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."
Sheldon,Is that your final decision?
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,"All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
Sheldon,You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
Sheldon,"Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch."
Sheldon,"He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2."
Sheldon,"Morning, old chum."
Sheldon,"I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
Sheldon,It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
Sheldon,"What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary."
Sheldon,"I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend."
Sheldon,Drat. No Frodo for you.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here."
Sheldon,"Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room."
Sheldon,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
Sheldon,"Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
Sheldon,"No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides."
Sheldon,Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
Sheldon,You will?
Sheldon,"Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Bye-bye."
Sheldon,"All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"
Sheldon,Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
Sheldon,"Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?"
Sheldon,"Yes, that good news."
Sheldon,"Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation."
Sheldon,That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
Sheldon,"I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard."
Sheldon,With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
Sheldon,"Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute.  Oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
Sheldon,Chicken?
Sheldon,With the little stars?
Sheldon,Heated to 180 degrees?
Sheldon,You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
Sheldon,"Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."
Sheldon,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
Sheldon,"Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now."
Sheldon,I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
Sheldon,"Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
Sheldon,What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
Sheldon,There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
Sheldon,Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
Sheldon,"I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge."
Sheldon,"Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena."
Sheldon,It bothers me.
Sheldon,A summons for what?
Sheldon,"November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room."
Sheldon,"Yes, it is."
Sheldon,"Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
Sheldon,"Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
Sheldon,So you betrayed me?
Sheldon,But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
Sheldon,I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
Sheldon,"I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went."
Sheldon,"You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
Sheldon,"Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee."
Sheldon,"Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious."
Sheldon,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
Sheldon,Howard?
Sheldon,"Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you?  All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
Sheldon,Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,That’s just wrong.
Sheldon,"Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
Sheldon,"I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?"
Sheldon,"Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?"
Sheldon,Excellent. Go on.
Sheldon,And who performed that heroic act?
Sheldon,"There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
Sheldon,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
Sheldon,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
Sheldon,"Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself."
Sheldon,"And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement."
Sheldon,"Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
Sheldon,"Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
Sheldon,I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
Sheldon,That’s my spot.
Sheldon,"Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?"
Sheldon,I need to use the restroom.
Sheldon,That’s the toilet?
Sheldon,Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
Sheldon,You know very well how it went.
Sheldon,I was found guilty and fined $533.
Sheldon,"I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
Sheldon,You had gelato with Stan Lee?
Sheldon,"Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
Sheldon,"Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee."
Sheldon,"No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
Sheldon,"This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door."
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."
Sheldon,We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
Sheldon,You said we were invited.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
Sheldon,"I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
Sheldon,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
Sheldon,"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
Sheldon,"Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
Sheldon,"No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman."
Sheldon,Fascinating.
Sheldon,It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
Sheldon,It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
Sheldon,"Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
Sheldon,"If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
Sheldon,"Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
Sheldon,"Other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
Sheldon,"We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
Sheldon,You mean my ring?
Sheldon,"The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."
Sheldon,I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
Sheldon,I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
Sheldon,Looking for something?
Sheldon,Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
Sheldon," It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter."
Sheldon,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
Sheldon,"No, it’s mine."
Sheldon,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
Sheldon,"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?"
Sheldon,"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?"
Sheldon,No! I call no Meemaws.
Sheldon,I don’t want to hear this.
Sheldon,Never.
Sheldon,Stop it!
Sheldon,I said stop it!
Sheldon,Waterfalls!
Sheldon,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
Sheldon,Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
Sheldon,"Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee."
Sheldon,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
Sheldon,Excellent choice.
Sheldon,I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine!  Where’s the ring?
Sheldon,I knew it. Give us the precious!
Sheldon,"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?"
Sheldon,"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
Sheldon,I won?
Sheldon,"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
Sheldon,"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  Problem."
Sheldon,They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
Sheldon,I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
Sheldon,Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
Sheldon,I’m not accepting the award.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
Sheldon,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
Sheldon,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
Sheldon,"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear. "
Sheldon,Don’t trample me.
Sheldon,"Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother.  Hello."
Sheldon,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
Sheldon,"Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant."
Sheldon,I do like the X-Men.
Sheldon,"I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?"
Sheldon,"That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
Sheldon,What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
Sheldon,"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
Sheldon,And I appreciate the pretence.
Sheldon,"No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men."
Sheldon,"And yet, you can’t speak to women."
Sheldon,"Okay, but don’t punch me."
Sheldon,"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
Sheldon,That’s what my sister used to say.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. Proceed.
Sheldon,"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
Sheldon,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
Sheldon,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
Sheldon,Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
Sheldon,Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
Sheldon,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount."
Sheldon,"Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
Sheldon,"Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
Sheldon,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum."
Sheldon,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
Sheldon,Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
Sheldon,It’s only one colour.
Sheldon,That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
Sheldon,Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.
Sheldon,In the prom department.
Sheldon,Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
Sheldon,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.
Sheldon,"That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s."
Sheldon,Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
Sheldon,"I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
Sheldon,I was wearing size a million pants.
Sheldon,"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
Sheldon,"Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
Sheldon,And how did that make you feel?
Sheldon,Go on.
Sheldon,"So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Leonard."
Sheldon,"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
Sheldon,I’m getting dizzy.
Sheldon,I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
Sheldon,Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
Sheldon,"I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
Sheldon,I’m ready.
Sheldon,"Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
Sheldon,"Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?"
Sheldon,"Question one, where are my pants?"
Sheldon,What do I search?
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
Sheldon,"You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant."
Sheldon,Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Sheldon,"Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
Sheldon,"Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
Sheldon,"For the record, giant rats are possible."
Sheldon,Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
Sheldon,But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her."
Sheldon,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
Sheldon,"Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
Sheldon,"We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"Remember, seven o’clock."
Sheldon,Pacific Daylight time!
Sheldon,Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
Sheldon,These are my own bowling shoes.
Sheldon,I know where my feet have been.
Sheldon,"Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."
Sheldon,"I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good."
Sheldon,"Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off."
Sheldon,"A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,This is for you.
Sheldon,"I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream."
Sheldon,"If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna."
Sheldon,"No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
Sheldon,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
Sheldon,No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
Sheldon,The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
Sheldon,"You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that."
Sheldon,When are you going to talk to him?
Sheldon,He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
Sheldon,"Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question."
Sheldon,"All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
Sheldon,"Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
Sheldon,"No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”"
Sheldon,"It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley."
Sheldon,"What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”"
Sheldon,Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
Sheldon,"No, it’s not the… Never mind."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
Sheldon,"No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,I so loathe you.
Sheldon,That’s not even from your franchise!
Sheldon,"Be the ball, Howard."
Sheldon,You weren’t the ball.
Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
Sheldon,"Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say."
Sheldon,Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
Sheldon,He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
Sheldon,"Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
Sheldon,"Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
Sheldon,"All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
Sheldon,"Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!"
Sheldon,"Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!"
Sheldon,"You did this, didn’t you?"
Sheldon,"No, I suppose not."
Sheldon,Wheaton!
Sheldon,Uh-oh.
Sheldon,I was going to get my mail.
Sheldon,"I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus."
Sheldon,"Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus."
Sheldon,"Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain."
Sheldon,Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
Sheldon,"Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse."
Sheldon,"Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve."
Sheldon,"Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period."
Sheldon,Bazinga.
Sheldon,"He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
Sheldon,I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
Sheldon,"That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat."
Sheldon,I’m hungry now.
Sheldon,Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. ."
Sheldon,I was talking with Penny.
Sheldon,Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
Sheldon,Which one picks last?
Sheldon,"Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair."
Sheldon,"Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!"
Sheldon,"Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
Sheldon,"Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!"
Sheldon,"Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
Sheldon,"Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk."
Sheldon,"I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first."
Sheldon,I can’t think of a reason why not.
Sheldon,"Hold on. Nope, no reason."
Sheldon,"All right, say hello to your mother for me."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,I didn’t say outside.
Sheldon,"No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior."
Sheldon,Which way are you going?
Sheldon,I’m going the other way. Bye.
Sheldon,"No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell."
Sheldon,Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
Sheldon,I shall. Have a nice scoot.
Sheldon,"Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!"
Sheldon, Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
Sheldon,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
Sheldon,I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
Sheldon,"Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention."
Sheldon,"Do you have a stomach ache, too?"
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
Sheldon,"Well, my new shoes are not made for running."
Sheldon,"No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm."
Sheldon,I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
Sheldon,You can’t cook and you made me this.
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell."
Sheldon,"I told you, walking."
Sheldon,I got lost.
Sheldon,Satellites are down. Solar flares.
Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Sheldon,Maybe this isn’t a good time.
Sheldon,Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
Sheldon,You may want to sit down.
Sheldon,Point taken. You may want to sit up.
Sheldon,I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
Sheldon,"We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?"
Sheldon,"I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
Sheldon,I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
Sheldon,"Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"
Sheldon,"Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
Sheldon,"And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs."
Sheldon,We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
Sheldon,It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
Sheldon,I can still eat.
Sheldon,"Okay, but just don’t fight"
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
Sheldon,Hold.
Sheldon,Explain your sneeze.
Sheldon,Do you have allergies?
Sheldon,Is there too much pepper on your salad?
Sheldon,I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
Sheldon,"That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
Sheldon,"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton."
Sheldon,"Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
Sheldon,"I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto."
Sheldon,"My room, of course."
Sheldon,Go ahead.
Sheldon,"A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
Sheldon,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
Sheldon,"Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?"
Sheldon,"When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?"
Sheldon,The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
Sheldon,I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
Sheldon,"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
Sheldon,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
Sheldon,"A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
Sheldon,"Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina."
Sheldon,"I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
Sheldon,I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
Sheldon,"No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
Sheldon,"Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles."
Sheldon,"No, he doesn’t understand. I understand."
Sheldon,You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
Sheldon,From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
Sheldon,"Get it together, man."
Sheldon,"All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
Sheldon,"In here, you’ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive."
Sheldon,"Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
Sheldon,"He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
Sheldon,"Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."
Sheldon,Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
Sheldon,"Sleep well, my friend."
Sheldon,"Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
Sheldon,Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
Sheldon,Morning.
Sheldon,Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself."
Sheldon,"All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
Sheldon,"Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
Sheldon,Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do."
Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
Sheldon,"I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal."
Sheldon,"Not Penny, me!"
Sheldon,"Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
Sheldon,"Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali"
Sheldon,And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon,"And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
Sheldon,This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
Sheldon,"No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you."
Sheldon,"I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!"
Sheldon,"Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system."
Sheldon,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
Sheldon,There’s doubt?
Sheldon,"That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right."
Sheldon,There you go.
Sheldon,Good what?
Sheldon,Go ahead.
Sheldon,I should’ve brought an umbrella.
Sheldon,"I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
Sheldon,"One of my best, don’t you think?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?"
Sheldon,How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
Sheldon,Not my world.
Sheldon,"I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
Sheldon,I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
Sheldon,"See, now this is a man for Penny."
Sheldon,"No, it’s not."
Sheldon,Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
Sheldon,Make it so.
Sheldon,I was wrong. Penny can do better.
Sheldon,He must be very skilled at coitus.
Sheldon,I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
Sheldon,"All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night."
Sheldon,What’s going on?
Sheldon,Oh! Not this again.
Sheldon,"In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny."
Sheldon,"When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?"
Sheldon,"FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
Sheldon,"As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
Sheldon,"Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard."
Sheldon,Counting this instance? 317.
Sheldon,She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
Sheldon,Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
Sheldon,I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
Sheldon,Who’s going to tell whom about what?
Sheldon,Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
Sheldon,Be more specific.
Sheldon,That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
Sheldon,It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
Sheldon,"Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
Sheldon,"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
Sheldon,"Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
Sheldon,"Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you."
Sheldon,He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
Sheldon,"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
Sheldon,What’s life without whimsy?
Sheldon,You’re bluffing.
Sheldon,Curse you.
Sheldon,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
Sheldon,Haughty derision it is.
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
Sheldon,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
Sheldon,"Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas."
Sheldon,May I buy you a beverage?
Sheldon,"Impressive, but we must be cautious."
Sheldon,"Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor."
Sheldon,No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
Sheldon,"You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
Sheldon,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
Sheldon,"I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree."
Sheldon,Yes?  Peace?
Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
Sheldon,"All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
Sheldon,"Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Yes, Penny."
Sheldon,Why on Earth would we have sex?
Sheldon,"I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?"
Sheldon,You mean dating?
Sheldon,I can’t date Amy.
Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
Sheldon,Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
Sheldon,"If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now."
Sheldon,I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,Wait. You have to drive me.
Sheldon,You know I don’t drive.
Sheldon,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
Sheldon,"Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
Sheldon,Now.
Sheldon,Hurry. We’re going to be late.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
Sheldon,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
Sheldon,Thank you for driving me.
Sheldon,I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
Sheldon,Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
Sheldon,"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
Sheldon,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
Sheldon,"Then, this is my first date."
Sheldon,"I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know."
Sheldon,"If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
Sheldon,Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?"
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,All right. It was hell.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
Sheldon,Muggles.
Sheldon,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count."
Sheldon,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
Sheldon,"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…"
Sheldon,I’m sorry. 16?
Sheldon,"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men."
Sheldon,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
Sheldon,"Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…"
Sheldon,"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31."
Sheldon,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
Sheldon,I should think so.
Sheldon,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
Sheldon,"I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
Sheldon,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
Sheldon,"In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?"
Sheldon,That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
Sheldon,Curses.
Sheldon,"Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night."
Sheldon,I’ve decided not to procreate.
Sheldon,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
Sheldon,And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
Sheldon,What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
Sheldon,"My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
Sheldon,Killed by badger.
Sheldon,"It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
Sheldon,"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?"
Sheldon,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left."
Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
Sheldon,"The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
Sheldon,By this much.
Sheldon,"You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
Sheldon,A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
Sheldon,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
Sheldon,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
Sheldon,"No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight."
Sheldon,"Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
Sheldon,It’s a small price to pay.
Sheldon,"In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet."
Sheldon,Correct.
Sheldon,"Essentially, yes."
Sheldon,"Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging."
Sheldon,"Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
Sheldon,"That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
Sheldon,I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
Sheldon,"Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
Sheldon,"It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!"
Sheldon,"I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
Sheldon,"So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?"
Sheldon,I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts."
Sheldon,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
Sheldon,"No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?"
Sheldon,What about your pedometer?
Sheldon,Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
Sheldon,"What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
Sheldon,Why are you doing that?
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,I am doing it.
Sheldon,We’ll never know.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!"
Sheldon,I think so.
Sheldon,Thank you. 
Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night."
Sheldon,"Coming! . Greetings, friends."
Sheldon,I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
Sheldon,"No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed."
Sheldon,"At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?"
Sheldon,An accident.
Sheldon,"Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
Sheldon,"You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
Sheldon,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
Sheldon,"I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming.  Ow! Aw."
Sheldon,"All right, I’m ready for my next question."
Sheldon,Uganda.
Sheldon,"Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs."
Sheldon,"In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?"
Sheldon,Defend.
Sheldon,You’re right. My apologies.
Sheldon,It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
Sheldon,It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
Sheldon,"You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here."
Sheldon,"Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008."
Sheldon,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,Sorry we’re late.
Sheldon,I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
Sheldon,"A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy."
Sheldon,"I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
Sheldon,It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
Sheldon,They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
Sheldon,"She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
Sheldon,"Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day."
Sheldon,"Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man."
Sheldon,"I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up."
Sheldon,So?
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
Sheldon,"May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore."
Sheldon,Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
Sheldon,Greetings.
Sheldon,I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
Sheldon,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
Sheldon,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
Sheldon,You take that back.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
Sheldon,"That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!"
Sheldon,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
Sheldon,There being no objections…
Sheldon,"The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Sheldon,Amen to that.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
Sheldon,Regarding what?
Sheldon,I don’t follow.
Sheldon,"Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before."
Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat."
Sheldon,"Oh, gentlemen."
Sheldon,"My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer."
Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
Sheldon,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
Sheldon,"Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles."
Sheldon,"I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy."
Sheldon,About what?
Sheldon,Clowder.
Sheldon,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
Sheldon,It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
Sheldon,It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
Sheldon,"You didn’t break up, she dumped you."
Sheldon,I was there. She dumped you.
Sheldon,"You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all."
Sheldon,Come in. 
Sheldon,"Mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
Sheldon,"I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…"
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone."
Sheldon,"I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy."
Sheldon,Coming!
Sheldon,Aw. What is she doing here?
Sheldon,"Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
Sheldon,"All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
Sheldon,"Yes, ma’am."
Sheldon,"That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met."
Sheldon,"Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there."
Sheldon,A physics point.
Sheldon,"Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
Sheldon,I’ll go as high as 40.
Sheldon,"Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
Sheldon,Would you like to see my cats?
Sheldon,"Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
Sheldon,"Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic."
Sheldon,"You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny? Penny?"
Sheldon,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
Sheldon,Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
Sheldon,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
Sheldon,Correct.
Sheldon,You’re two for two.
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
Sheldon,Because…
Sheldon,It’s my office.
Sheldon,"All right, all right. He can buy his own desk."
Sheldon,"Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?"
Sheldon,They do some of their best work at night.
Sheldon,One question.
Sheldon,Why on earth are you telling me all this?
Sheldon,This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
Sheldon,It’s actually British.
Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
Sheldon,"Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?"
Sheldon,"All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you."
Sheldon,Help me move my desk.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
Sheldon,"All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted."
Sheldon,Stand by for my upcoming tat.
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,I’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
Sheldon,"Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Highly. Oh, dear. "
Sheldon,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
Sheldon,It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
Sheldon,"Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler."
Sheldon,I sense judgment on your part.
Sheldon,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
Sheldon,I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
Sheldon,"Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
Sheldon,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
Sheldon,"You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
Sheldon,"No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?"
Sheldon,"Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
Sheldon,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
Sheldon,"It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?"
Sheldon,"Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
Sheldon,It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!"
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no!"
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Leonard? Are you sleeping?
Sheldon,Are you ill?
Sheldon,"Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?"
Sheldon,I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
Sheldon,You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
Sheldon,Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
Sheldon,"As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy."
Sheldon,"Did you know that, Leonard?"
Sheldon,I did.
Sheldon,"Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?"
Sheldon,"Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?"
Sheldon,He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
Sheldon,Let’s make that our word of the day.
Sheldon,"Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you."
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,I see. Can I get back to you on that?
Sheldon,"Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,"
Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
Sheldon,What does that mean?
Sheldon,Uh-huh.
Sheldon,Wait. What?
Sheldon,I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
Sheldon,"Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing."
Sheldon,You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
Sheldon,Wait! What am I supposed to do?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie."
Sheldon,Screwed.
Sheldon,Amy’s right. He is tedious.
Sheldon,"As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
Sheldon,I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
Sheldon,Exactly.
Sheldon,Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
Sheldon,She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
Sheldon,"Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy."
Sheldon,Darn! She found me!
Sheldon,"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack."
Sheldon,Tell her I’m not here.
Sheldon,"I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
Sheldon,Way to go on the details.
Sheldon,Rats!
Sheldon,"No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
Sheldon,So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
Sheldon,And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
Sheldon,Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
Sheldon,"My apologies. Good night, Amy."
Sheldon,I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina."
Sheldon,"Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out."
Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya."
Sheldon,Why would I change?
Sheldon,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible."
Sheldon,"Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs."
Sheldon,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
Sheldon,"I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day."
Sheldon,"The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
Sheldon,"Well then apparently, you hate fun."
Sheldon,He rejected train day.
Sheldon,Abundantly.
Sheldon,That’s what I said.
Sheldon,Do you like trains?
Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
Sheldon,"You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that."
Sheldon,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
Sheldon,"Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
Sheldon,"Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me."
Sheldon,"Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
Sheldon,"Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,Five more minutes.
Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
Sheldon,No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
Sheldon,That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
Sheldon,"Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak."
Sheldon,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
Sheldon,"I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume."
Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
Sheldon,"Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
Sheldon,"Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
Sheldon,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
Sheldon,Excellent choice.
Sheldon,Priya?
Sheldon,"For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
Sheldon,"Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?"
Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
Sheldon,"Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
Sheldon,"In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard."
Sheldon,"April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt."
Sheldon,And Raj.
Sheldon,And me.
Sheldon,"Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
Sheldon,You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
Sheldon,"You mean, you want me to keep a secret."
Sheldon,You know I can’t keep a secret.
Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
Sheldon,"Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret."
Sheldon,Ta-da!
Sheldon,Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
Sheldon,"I know, that’s why I shortened it."
Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
Sheldon,"You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman."
Sheldon,"The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary."
Sheldon,"You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
Sheldon,"It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair."
Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
Sheldon,"Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
Sheldon,"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole."
Sheldon,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
Sheldon,"Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable."
Sheldon,"Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
Sheldon,"I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
Sheldon,"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely."
Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
Sheldon,"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
Sheldon,For science.
Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
Sheldon,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
Sheldon,Alright. But I’m watching you.
Sheldon,"Well, sure."
Sheldon,Guess.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,You’re so close.
Sheldon,"Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"
Sheldon,The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
Sheldon,Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
Sheldon,"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
Sheldon,"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
Sheldon,Not particularly.
Sheldon,I suppose I could if I were asked.
Sheldon,Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"You say you’re Special Agent Page, FBI."
Sheldon,And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.
Sheldon,Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
Sheldon,"For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
Sheldon,"Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven’t I heard back yet?"
Sheldon,That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
Sheldon,"A little, but go on."
Sheldon,"I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?"
Sheldon,"You heard me say blu-ray, right?"
Sheldon,Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
Sheldon,"Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is."
Sheldon,Did I say Mars Rover?
Sheldon,"That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
Sheldon,I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident."
Sheldon,"Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha."
Sheldon,"Sleep eludes me, Leonard."
Sheldon,Mockery? That’s all you have to offer?
Sheldon,Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
Sheldon,"Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance."
Sheldon,But why should that keep me up?
Sheldon,Interesting. So you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
Sheldon,Excuse me?
Sheldon,Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
Sheldon,"That seems fairly conclusive.  No, Gorn, no. That’s where I sit."
Sheldon,"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.
Sheldon,"Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…"
Sheldon,But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
Sheldon,"I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
Sheldon,"No, it’s a different Leonard. He’s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye."
Sheldon,Raj. Have you seen Howard?
Sheldon,I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
Sheldon,"If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson."
Sheldon,Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
Sheldon,"Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement."
Sheldon,"No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I’m here now to say I’m sorry."
Sheldon,"Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five."
Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"Oh, shut up."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
Sheldon,I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
Sheldon,Alcohol.
Sheldon,Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
Sheldon,Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
Sheldon,More or less.
Sheldon,"I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky."
Sheldon,"You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…"
Sheldon,That’s not how it looks in the picture.
Sheldon,All right. To the metric system.  I can’t taste the cherries.
Sheldon,"I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology."
Sheldon,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?"
Sheldon,"To drinking.  Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt."
Sheldon,"I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru."
Sheldon,Captain Kirk won.
Sheldon,Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.
Sheldon,Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.
Sheldon,I’ll reprogram Howard.
Sheldon,"No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. "
Sheldon,"Hello, all."
Sheldon,"Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?"
Sheldon,"Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
Sheldon,There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
Sheldon,It’s for Howard.
Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this."
Sheldon,No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.
Sheldon,No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.
Sheldon,High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
Sheldon,I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
Sheldon,"That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary."
Sheldon,There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.
Sheldon,Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
Sheldon,"Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month."
Sheldon,"May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
Sheldon,"Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go."
Sheldon,See? Howard’s on my side.
Sheldon,Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.
Sheldon,What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?
Sheldon,But how were our seats?
Sheldon,"I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
Sheldon,Shrewd.
Sheldon,"Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?"
Sheldon,Knock-knock.
Sheldon,Hugh.
Sheldon,Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
Sheldon,"Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly."
Sheldon,I informed you thusly.
Sheldon,This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
Sheldon,"And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones."
Sheldon,What did he say?
Sheldon,We might not get seats?
Sheldon,"Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly."
Sheldon,"Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe."
Sheldon,"Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
Sheldon,Of what? Poorly executed beards?
Sheldon,"This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
Sheldon,"I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!"
Sheldon,"Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?"
Sheldon,"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
Sheldon,No!
Sheldon,This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
Sheldon,You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.
Sheldon,"Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round."
Sheldon,You whistled?
Sheldon,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it."
Sheldon,No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
Sheldon,"Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s Lee, but I prefer Trouble."
Sheldon,"Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
Sheldon,"Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
Sheldon,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
Sheldon,"As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam."
Sheldon,"Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition."
Sheldon,"Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt."
Sheldon,"I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon."
Sheldon,"You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
Sheldon,Aw.
Sheldon,"Well, who would ever guess that?"
Sheldon,"Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
Sheldon,"If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
Sheldon,I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
Sheldon,"Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits."
Sheldon,Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
Sheldon,"Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
Sheldon,"Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here."
Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
Sheldon,"Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?"
Sheldon,"I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret."
Sheldon,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
Sheldon,"Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation."
Sheldon,"What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer."
Sheldon,Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?"
Sheldon,"Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc."
Sheldon,Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
Sheldon,"Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth."
Sheldon,I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
Sheldon,All right. What were the symptoms?
Sheldon,Localized to what region?
Sheldon,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
Sheldon,Who?
Sheldon,Then why did you ask?
Sheldon,Who.
Sheldon,"All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?"
Sheldon,Zack.
Sheldon,Because you keep saying who.
Sheldon,"And the answer was Zack, correct?"
Sheldon,"All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
Sheldon,How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
Sheldon,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
Sheldon,Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
Sheldon,"A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself."
Sheldon,Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?
Sheldon,"Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar."
Sheldon,Cheap science fiction?
Sheldon,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
Sheldon,"I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it."
Sheldon,I reject it.
Sheldon,I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
Sheldon,"Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right."
Sheldon,The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
Sheldon,Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
Sheldon,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you."
Sheldon,What insult?
Sheldon,Forget science. She’s horny.
Sheldon,It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
Sheldon,What are you suggesting?
Sheldon,It’s illegal to spay a human being.
Sheldon,Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
Sheldon,"Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens."
Sheldon,"Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin."
Sheldon,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
Sheldon,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
Sheldon,Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Sheldon,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system."
Sheldon,Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
Sheldon,I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work."
Sheldon,"No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool."
Sheldon,Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
Sheldon,That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
Sheldon,"Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud."
Sheldon,"Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
Sheldon,You’re embarrassing yourself.
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,That’s very hurtful.
Sheldon,Milk Dud?
Sheldon,Literally? Literally a million years?
Sheldon,"In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
Sheldon,Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
Sheldon,"To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman."
Sheldon,"That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?"
Sheldon,I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
Sheldon,Why not? Penny did it.
Sheldon,"Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
Sheldon,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
Sheldon,We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
Sheldon,This is how the Flash paces.
Sheldon,I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
Sheldon,Don’t. He’s making our case.
Sheldon,  Penny.
Sheldon,"I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times."
Sheldon,I understand why you’re upset.
Sheldon,Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
Sheldon,Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
Sheldon,"But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?"
Sheldon,I may have failed.
Sheldon,"Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
Sheldon,I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
Sheldon,Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
Sheldon,Oh.
Sheldon,What’s the bad news?
Sheldon,Thank you! Thank you so much!
Sheldon,"No, wait! I have a speech."
Sheldon,Stop counting!
Sheldon,"This is my moment, dag nab it!"
Sheldon,I’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I’m waiting.
Sheldon,We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
Sheldon,"I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
Sheldon,Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good."
Sheldon,"No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations."
Sheldon,Oh!
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, shush."
Sheldon,"You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
Sheldon,Of Texas.
Sheldon,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
Sheldon,"Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard."
Sheldon,"She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
Sheldon,"All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
Sheldon,A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
Sheldon,"Duly noted, Steve from Wichita."
Sheldon,"Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder."
Sheldon,"You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee."
Sheldon,"All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed."
Sheldon,"Good one, boss."
Sheldon,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
Sheldon,"In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
Sheldon,"If you say so, boss."
Sheldon,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
Sheldon,Does it? A happy accident.
Sheldon,"All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
Sheldon,"Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs."
Sheldon,Another happy accident.
Sheldon,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
Sheldon,Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
Sheldon,I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
Sheldon,"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
Sheldon,"All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny."
Sheldon,Really? Why?
Sheldon,I see. And is that open for discussion?
Sheldon,"Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
Sheldon,"Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor."
Sheldon,But I made it better.
Sheldon,"Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants."
Sheldon,"They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
Sheldon,"Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex."
Sheldon,"Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these."
Sheldon,Don’t thank me. You earned it.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
Sheldon,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
Sheldon,"Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back."
Sheldon,"Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?"
Sheldon,"Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?"
Sheldon,"Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress."
Sheldon,Playing the theremin.
Sheldon,"Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
Sheldon,"That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well, that was a little uncalled for."
Sheldon,"So, your project is more important than mine?"
Sheldon,"Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave."
Sheldon,Could have beaten around the bush a little.
Sheldon,I’m practicing my theremin.
Sheldon,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
Sheldon,He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
Sheldon,Yes. And they’re still sticky.
Sheldon,Probably going to have to throw them away.
Sheldon,With you?
Sheldon,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
Sheldon,That’s your app idea?
Sheldon,"I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
Sheldon,"I know, it’s baffling.  Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen."
Sheldon,Do you make it with milk or water?
Sheldon,Real cocoa?
Sheldon,Do you have those little marshmallows?
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose it’s appropriate."
Sheldon,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
Sheldon,Really? Leonard wants me back?
Sheldon,"Well, we sure saw that coming."
Sheldon,You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
Sheldon,How?
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,I was being sarcastic.
Sheldon,"Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be."
Sheldon,"Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
Sheldon,"Boy, I’m getting good at this."
Sheldon,"Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership."
Sheldon,"Well, I must say, I am impressed."
Sheldon,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
Sheldon,"As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea."
Sheldon,Bored.
Sheldon,"Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…"
Sheldon,"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?"
Sheldon,Probably serving food that was ordered today.
Sheldon,"In order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
Sheldon,I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
Sheldon,You lied to me?
Sheldon,"Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
Sheldon,"Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder."
Sheldon,"All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny."
Sheldon,"She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
Sheldon,"Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised."
Sheldon,It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
Sheldon,"Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger."
Sheldon,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
Sheldon,No. Amy?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?"
Sheldon,That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
Sheldon,I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
Sheldon,Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
Sheldon,Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
Sheldon, Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
Sheldon,"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard."
Sheldon,"Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?"
Sheldon,"Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
Sheldon,Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
Sheldon,I guess not.
Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?"
Sheldon,Must be out of range.
Sheldon,"All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
Sheldon,"Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves."
Sheldon,"Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today."
Sheldon,Tell me what?
Sheldon,"Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
Sheldon,"It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
Sheldon,For instance?
Sheldon,"Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz."
Sheldon,Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
Sheldon,I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
Sheldon,Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"You’re an  actress, correct?"
Sheldon,All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
Sheldon,Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
Sheldon,"It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one."
Sheldon,"So, when could we start?"
Sheldon,I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
Sheldon,Are you going to help me or not?
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road."
Sheldon,I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,Nothing. I was acting.
Sheldon,"Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s"
Sheldon,How shall we begin?
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,"Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
Sheldon,You’re the teacher.
Sheldon,Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
Sheldon,Gotcha.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Action.
Sheldon,"Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"
Sheldon,"I’d like a frozen yogurt, please."
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,You do?
Sheldon,All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
Sheldon,It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
Sheldon,"Oh, and we’re going to use props?"
Sheldon,You have any frozen yogurt?
Sheldon,Yes. I didn’t care for it.
Sheldon,"So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either."
Sheldon,I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
Sheldon,Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
Sheldon,"It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
Sheldon,"Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life."
Sheldon,Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
Sheldon,Very well. I’ll set the scene.
Sheldon,"East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches."
Sheldon,Hoo!
Sheldon,"Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
Sheldon,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
Sheldon,"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
Sheldon,"I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”"
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
Sheldon,"Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear."
Sheldon,"Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo."
Sheldon,"Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!"
Sheldon,Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
Sheldon,"Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
Sheldon,"That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
Sheldon,"It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
Sheldon,"Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?"
Sheldon,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
Sheldon,"I don’t care, it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform."
Sheldon,Ugh!
Sheldon,Sheldon is not going.
Sheldon,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
Sheldon,"Don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
Sheldon,"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites."
Sheldon,"Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I’m not above minimizing your window."
Sheldon,That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
Sheldon,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
Sheldon,"Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."
Sheldon,Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
Sheldon,No!
Sheldon,"Oh, the humanities!"
Sheldon,"An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?"
Sheldon,"Okay, I see what’s happening."
Sheldon,"My stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal."
Sheldon,"No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"
Sheldon,"You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
Sheldon,"No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks."
Sheldon,"Oh, wow!"
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
Sheldon,"Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
Sheldon,But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
Sheldon,"Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
Sheldon,It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
Sheldon,"Hold on, I have something for you."
Sheldon,"Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M."
Sheldon,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
Sheldon,"Oh, come on! Why not?"
Sheldon,"Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
Sheldon,No. But thank you for asking.
Sheldon,What’s going on?
Sheldon,Are you just getting home?
Sheldon,"That’s a good sign, right?"
Sheldon,I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
Sheldon,She stiffed you?
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard."
Sheldon,"That’s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you."
Sheldon,Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
Sheldon,What’s going on?
Sheldon,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
Sheldon,"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
Sheldon,"You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?"
Sheldon,"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here."
Sheldon,"Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you."
Sheldon,"No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you."
Sheldon,That’s what tertiary friends are for.
Sheldon,Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
Sheldon,"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard."
Sheldon,"Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants."
Sheldon,"That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports."
Sheldon,"No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
Sheldon,Did you get the part?
Sheldon,"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
Sheldon,It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
Sheldon,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
Sheldon,"At home, forbidding it."
Sheldon,I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
Sheldon,"Actually, it’s the three of us."
Sheldon,Right. I’ll make tea.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
Sheldon,"Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
Sheldon,"Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?"
Sheldon,"But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan."
Sheldon,"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t want to go to a party."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
Sheldon,Because we don’t throw parties.
Sheldon,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
Sheldon,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
Sheldon,I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
Sheldon,"But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both."
Sheldon,"No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear!"
Sheldon,Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
Sheldon,"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style."
Sheldon,"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
Sheldon,Is it about me or the dead pixels?
Sheldon,"Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
Sheldon,"Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in."
Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone."
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required."
Sheldon,A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
Sheldon,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
Sheldon,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
Sheldon,Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
Sheldon,"I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment."
Sheldon,"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?"
Sheldon,Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
Sheldon,"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it."
Sheldon,Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
Sheldon,Cluck-cluck-cluck.
Sheldon,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
Sheldon,I’m setting out snacks.
Sheldon,"I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton."
Sheldon,Possibly. I Tweeted him.
Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,"We had a good run, you and I."
Sheldon,But change is a part of life.
Sheldon,Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
Sheldon,"Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard."
Sheldon,"And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back."
Sheldon,"Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?"
Sheldon,"That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?"
Sheldon,Of course. Barry?
Sheldon,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
Sheldon,"Yes, you must be present to win."
Sheldon,Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
Sheldon,"Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis."
Sheldon,"Surprisingly, yes."
Sheldon,The water level rose.
Sheldon,"Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
Sheldon,"Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting."
Sheldon,"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
Sheldon,"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
Sheldon,"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun."
Sheldon,I’m unhappy.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Are there beans in it?
Sheldon,"Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
Sheldon,"Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered."
Sheldon,"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
Sheldon,She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
Sheldon,"Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech."
Sheldon,Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
Sheldon,It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
Sheldon,Fine. Give me a second.
Sheldon,It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked."
Sheldon,"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards."
Sheldon,Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
Sheldon,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
Sheldon,So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic."
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,"I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card."
Sheldon,As you wish.  Did you pick one?
Sheldon, Is this your card?
Sheldon,Drat. Is this your card?
Sheldon,I’ll be right back.
Sheldon,"Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing."
Sheldon,I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
Sheldon,"I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm."
Sheldon,Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
Sheldon,"Relax, we’re not under attack right now."
Sheldon,"And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it."
Sheldon,All right. Pick a card.
Sheldon,Bippity-boppity-boo.
Sheldon,"The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da."
Sheldon,"I said, ta-da. Show’s over."
Sheldon,That does it. I’m getting uranium.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother."
Sheldon,Figure out the magic trick yet?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business."
Sheldon,I hate you.
Sheldon,"Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?"
Sheldon,"They stole everything, Leonard, everything."
Sheldon,"What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
Sheldon,"What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me."
Sheldon,They took my battle ostrich.
Sheldon,"Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved."
Sheldon,Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
Sheldon,Doctor Cooper.
Sheldon,"That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
Sheldon,"You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
Sheldon,It’s all gone. All gone.
Sheldon,"What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?"
Sheldon,"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
Sheldon,See if Raj is done with Pilates.
Sheldon,"Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
Sheldon,Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
Sheldon,Can we trust him?
Sheldon,"No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope."
Sheldon,"That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game."
Sheldon,Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
Sheldon,I thought I just did.
Sheldon,"Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider."
Sheldon,"I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!"
Sheldon,And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!"
Sheldon,The name and the address drip with evil.
Sheldon,Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
Sheldon,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
Sheldon,"I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
Sheldon,"Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?"
Sheldon,"Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?"
Sheldon,Sure.
Sheldon,Fine. Leonard?
Sheldon,"One moment.  I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother."
Sheldon,That’s uncanny.
Sheldon,"Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki."
Sheldon,"I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?"
Sheldon,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
Sheldon,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
Sheldon,I always prefer the train.
Sheldon,Coming.
Sheldon,No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
Sheldon,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
Sheldon,"Well, now I just feel silly holding it."
Sheldon,Can I at least kick down the door?
Sheldon,Your doom!
Sheldon,Good point. Basket of puppies.
Sheldon,Are you Todd Zarnecki?
Sheldon,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
Sheldon,Careful. That’s a collectible.
Sheldon,"Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
Sheldon,"You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless."
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,It’d be swell if they had a train.
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
Sheldon,No. We failed in our noble quest.
Sheldon,Todd Zarnecki was mean.
Sheldon,"We did it! I said, we."
Sheldon,Hysterical.
Sheldon,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
Sheldon,Ba-dum-bump.
Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you."
Sheldon,"Forgive my language, but poppycock."
Sheldon,"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?"
Sheldon,"I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?"
Sheldon,You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
Sheldon,"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan."
Sheldon,Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
Sheldon,"I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?"
Sheldon,With what?
Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
Sheldon,"Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too.  That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night."
Sheldon,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
Sheldon,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
Sheldon,"Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity."
Sheldon,"All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard."
Sheldon,"Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows."
Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
Sheldon,"That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains."
Sheldon,Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
Sheldon,Why are you smiling?
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Have you learned anything?
Sheldon,"If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking."
Sheldon,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
Sheldon,"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted."
Sheldon,"I’m familiar with everything, but go on."
Sheldon,"I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
Sheldon,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
Sheldon,It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
Sheldon,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
Sheldon,"Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Sheldon,Hey.
Sheldon,"Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context."
Sheldon,"Yes, I believe so."
Sheldon,Yes. Why do you ask?
Sheldon,"Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
Sheldon,"Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do."
Sheldon,Did you get that?
Sheldon,This is moving faster than we thought.
Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
Sheldon,Pun intended?
Sheldon,This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
Sheldon,"Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. What pun?
Sheldon,"I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is."
Sheldon,Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in the shower?"
Sheldon,"I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now."
Sheldon,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
Sheldon,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
Sheldon,"Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
Sheldon,I assure you I do.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
Sheldon,"According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force."
Sheldon,"Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?"
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon,Move. Move. Move!
Sheldon,"Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?"
Sheldon,"Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
Sheldon,"Um, it’s fairly technical."
Sheldon,"Do so, do so."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
Sheldon,Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
Sheldon,But…
Sheldon,This isn’t over.
Sheldon,What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
Sheldon,"Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food."
Sheldon,Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
Sheldon,"Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon,The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
Sheldon,"A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
Sheldon,Shotgun.
Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
Sheldon,"It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion."
Sheldon,I don’t know how to process that.
Sheldon,"Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s."
Sheldon,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
Sheldon,I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
Sheldon,"No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
Sheldon,I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
Sheldon,"Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna."
Sheldon,"No, you most certainly are not."
Sheldon,I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
Sheldon,"Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. "
Sheldon,What happened to you?
Sheldon,What’s 16 times 14?
Sheldon,And there’s your answer.
Sheldon,"If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one."
Sheldon,It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
Sheldon,Thank you. Is someone smoking?
Sheldon,You own a smoking monkey?
Sheldon,What’s he doing here?
Sheldon,Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
Sheldon,Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
Sheldon,"Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
Sheldon,"No, of course not."
Sheldon,"I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I play dirty?
Sheldon,Fascinating.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it."
Sheldon,"Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?"
Sheldon,"Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B."
Sheldon,"That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
Sheldon,"Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter."
Sheldon,20 seconds.
Sheldon,"He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
Sheldon,I never bluff. Ten.
Sheldon,Nine.
Sheldon,Eight.
Sheldon,"It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?"
Sheldon,Three.
Sheldon,Two.
Sheldon,"You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy."
Sheldon,"Good morning, Amy."
Sheldon,"Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
Sheldon,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
Sheldon,"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left."
Sheldon,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
Sheldon,"You’re preaching to the choir, sister."
Sheldon,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
Sheldon,"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
Sheldon,"It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman."
Sheldon,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh."
Sheldon,"Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Sheldon,That’s because it’s simple.
Sheldon,And…
Sheldon,"And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that."
Sheldon,"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines."
Sheldon,You know I’m right.
Sheldon,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?
Sheldon,"Sorry, I have company."
Sheldon,I don’t want to hug you.
Sheldon,"Blue, as in depressed."
Sheldon,I don’t know what colour lonely is.
Sheldon,"Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
Sheldon,"All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all."
Sheldon,I’m working on my three-person chess game.
Sheldon,It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
Sheldon,"Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
Sheldon,It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
Sheldon,"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
Sheldon,"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself."
Sheldon,Yellow. Go ahead.
Sheldon,Fascinating. What’s in it?
Sheldon,I like cows.
Sheldon,It was its own point. Go on.
Sheldon,"Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs."
Sheldon,I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
Sheldon,"Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,I’d like to buy a scone.
Sheldon,"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
Sheldon,They were out of scones.
Sheldon,My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
Sheldon,When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
Sheldon,I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
Sheldon,"Well, that’s it then. I’m dead."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
Sheldon,He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is a nightmare!"
Sheldon,"To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!"
Sheldon,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
Sheldon,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
Sheldon,Fire demon.
Sheldon,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
Sheldon,Last one.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord!"
Sheldon,Where’s the mouthwash?
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?"
Sheldon,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
Sheldon,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
Sheldon,Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space."
Sheldon,"Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
Sheldon,"To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so."
Sheldon,I can’t.
Sheldon,"Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
Sheldon,I would think he would know that.
Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel."
Sheldon,A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
Sheldon,"Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
Sheldon,Disagree.
Sheldon,"I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
Sheldon,"Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
Sheldon,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
Sheldon,"Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
Sheldon,"This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!"
Sheldon,"No, I haven’t. It’s all good."
Sheldon,Mountain Elf.
Sheldon,Must you?
Sheldon,"Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win."
Sheldon,"Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
Sheldon,It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
Sheldon,"Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?"
Sheldon,"Oh, congratulations."
Sheldon,"Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD."
Sheldon,Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
Sheldon,It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
Sheldon,"I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
Sheldon,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Rotating.
Sheldon,You mean the myofascial point?
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!"
Sheldon,There’s someone at my door.
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
Sheldon,"No, I can’t authorize that."
Sheldon,"The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
Sheldon,"All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
Sheldon,"Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
Sheldon,I never kid about safety.
Sheldon,"Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while."
Sheldon,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over."
Sheldon,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
Sheldon,"As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign."
Sheldon,"Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air."
Sheldon,"Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights."
Sheldon,What is this?
Sheldon,Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
Sheldon,"Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
Sheldon,"My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way."
Sheldon,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
Sheldon,You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
Sheldon,"No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
Sheldon,"Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
Sheldon,When does a monkey have a trunk?
Sheldon,"Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"I said, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,I have paperwork that says differently.
Sheldon,Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you understand this?"
Sheldon,Talk to him.
Sheldon,What does it look like?
Sheldon,It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
Sheldon,"Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
Sheldon,"If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend."
Sheldon,"No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like."
Sheldon,Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
Sheldon,"Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
Sheldon,"That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
Sheldon,"For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
Sheldon,"Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
Sheldon,"Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you."
Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. "
Sheldon,"No, it’s not Amy."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
Sheldon,"All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle."
Sheldon,"Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out."
Sheldon,You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
Sheldon,"This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?"
Sheldon,"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing."
Sheldon,No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
Sheldon,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. "
Sheldon,"If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal."
Sheldon,What about Nebraska?
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
Sheldon,"All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
Sheldon,You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
Sheldon,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
Sheldon,As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
Sheldon,"Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
Sheldon,Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
Sheldon,"When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
Sheldon,Don’t you like Amy?
Sheldon,"Well, there’s the difference. "
Sheldon,I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
Sheldon,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
Sheldon,"If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
Sheldon,A good wife would go to the store.
Sheldon,"Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
Sheldon,"It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name."
Sheldon,Chair.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,I’ve been sitting in garbage!
Sheldon,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
Sheldon,There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
Sheldon,"Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest."
Sheldon,Name one time I’ve ever done that.
Sheldon,"I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
Sheldon,All right. It is a comfortable chair.
Sheldon,"No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment."
Sheldon,You have to get rid of the chair.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  Penny."
Sheldon, Amy.
Sheldon,"Is not. Is not, is not."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"You’re good friends with Penny, right?"
Sheldon,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
Sheldon,Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
Sheldon,Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
Sheldon,"All right, name your price."
Sheldon,You mean like Salt Lake City?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past.  I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!"
Sheldon,"Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
Sheldon,"I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
Sheldon,"Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?"
Sheldon,"Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
Sheldon,"No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."
Sheldon,"I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge."
Sheldon,"Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
Sheldon,"Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do."
Sheldon,You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
Sheldon,"I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that."
Sheldon,Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
Sheldon,"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
Sheldon,"All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
Sheldon,"Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier."
Sheldon,All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
Sheldon,"Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth."
Sheldon,I did. How was yours?
Sheldon,What exactly do you mean by that?
Sheldon,To send a message. She is not for you.
Sheldon,Not for you!
Sheldon,"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"
Sheldon,"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too."
Sheldon,You see a dragon.
Sheldon,"When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
Sheldon,"Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
Sheldon,One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
Sheldon,"Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven."
Sheldon,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
Sheldon,Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
Sheldon,That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
Sheldon,Hamburgers and lemonade.
Sheldon,"And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!"
Sheldon,Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
Sheldon,"Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."
Sheldon,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
Sheldon,"Let’s see.  Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
Sheldon,"Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
Sheldon,"Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
Sheldon,"No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich."
Sheldon,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
Sheldon,"Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to…  stay right here."
Sheldon,"Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
Sheldon,"Hurry, hurry, hurry."
Sheldon,"I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
Sheldon,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."
Sheldon,Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
Sheldon,"Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?"
Sheldon,"Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it."
Sheldon,Okay? It’s magnificent.
Sheldon,"Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it."
Sheldon,"Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it."
Sheldon,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
Sheldon,"Take it, take it."
Sheldon,Killing you? I can’t breathe.
Sheldon,"Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry."
Sheldon,"I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
Sheldon,"Hello, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
Sheldon,I’m not surprised.
Sheldon,Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
Sheldon,"I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."
Sheldon,"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."
Sheldon,Possibly.
Sheldon,"It’s not that simple, Leonard."
Sheldon,"At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship."
Sheldon,"Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor."
Sheldon,"In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
Sheldon,Mohammed Lee.
Sheldon,"Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
Sheldon,That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
Sheldon,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me."
Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy."
Sheldon,"Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?"
Sheldon,"In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?"
Sheldon,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
Sheldon,"Well, I started the list when I was nine."
Sheldon,"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
Sheldon,"Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for."
Sheldon,Not yet.
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
Sheldon,Brent Spiner?
Sheldon,I don’t care.
Sheldon,"I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."
Sheldon,"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork."
Sheldon,"Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home."
Sheldon,What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
Sheldon,An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
Sheldon,"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"
Sheldon,"Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
Sheldon,"Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house."
Sheldon,"Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles."
Sheldon,"Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
Sheldon,"The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
Sheldon,"Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
Sheldon,Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
Sheldon,Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
Sheldon,There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
Sheldon,Told you.
Sheldon,Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
Sheldon,The prospect of fried chicken.
Sheldon,"Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
Sheldon,"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
Sheldon,I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
Sheldon,Get them before they get us.
Sheldon,"Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
Sheldon,Offer them a hot beverage.
Sheldon,Coffee.
Sheldon,"I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
Sheldon,Double Stuf?
Sheldon,Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
Sheldon,"I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
Sheldon,"Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
Sheldon,"It is nice, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
Sheldon,"Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
Sheldon,Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
Sheldon,"I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A."
Sheldon,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
Sheldon,"What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it."
Sheldon,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
Sheldon,"Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts."
Sheldon,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
Sheldon,"I’m not going, and you can’t make me."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
Sheldon,I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
Sheldon,"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother."
Sheldon,"All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. "
Sheldon,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
Sheldon,"No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
Sheldon,"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
Sheldon,"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
Sheldon,Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
Sheldon,"Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  Smarty-pants."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. "
Sheldon,"I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
Sheldon,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom.You’re the best."
Sheldon,"I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
Sheldon,Yours.
Sheldon,"No, we don’t. The one we have works great."
Sheldon,"Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler."
Sheldon,Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
Sheldon,Get out!
Sheldon,"Well, I know, but he means well. Sing."
Sheldon,"What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top."
Sheldon,"And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
Sheldon,"Hmm.  All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn."
Sheldon,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow."
Sheldon,"Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
Sheldon,"Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. "
Sheldon,Gentlemen. .
Sheldon,Droll.
Sheldon,"Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico."
Sheldon,Be sure to check the mail.
Sheldon,Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
Sheldon,"Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
Sheldon,Open the mail!
Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples."
Sheldon,"well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
Sheldon,Be a lamb and check.
Sheldon,It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
Sheldon,Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
Sheldon,"I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this."
Sheldon,"Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done.  Perfect."
Sheldon,Science. You wouldn’t understand.
Sheldon,I thought you were leaving the apartment.
Sheldon,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
Sheldon,"Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss."
Sheldon,"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."
Sheldon,"You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
Sheldon,It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
Sheldon,"On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
Sheldon,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
Sheldon,"Great. Tropicana, no pulp."
Sheldon,"It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz."
Sheldon,Really? That’s very unsettling.
Sheldon,Hi.
Sheldon,"It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
Sheldon,"Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
Sheldon,It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
Sheldon,"Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?"
Sheldon,We are?
Sheldon,"Oh, no! I can’t!"
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Oh, God! One, two, three!"
Sheldon,"What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… ."
Sheldon,"Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny."
Sheldon,I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
Sheldon,"Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse."
Sheldon,You’re leaving?
Sheldon,"Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
Sheldon,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
Sheldon,Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
Sheldon,"I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
Sheldon,"The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."
Sheldon,"Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
Sheldon,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
Sheldon,How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
Sheldon,"Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
Sheldon,"If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
Sheldon,And that made you feel sad?
Sheldon,"I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this."
Sheldon,"When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
Sheldon,Always.
Sheldon,"Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."
Sheldon,"Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy."
Sheldon,"Neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
Sheldon,"Very well. Oh, boy. "
Sheldon,The two of you need to get your women in line!
Sheldon,"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."
Sheldon,"You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
Sheldon,"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
Sheldon,"Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way."
Sheldon,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
Sheldon,"Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful."
Sheldon,"Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard."
Sheldon,"I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
Sheldon,"Shoo, shoo! Be gone!"
Sheldon,"There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo."
Sheldon,"It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets."
Sheldon,That doesn’t help.
Sheldon," Go away, bird."
Sheldon,"Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night."
Sheldon,"Quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
Sheldon,"Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help."
Sheldon,"It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins."
Sheldon,Do you think it’s a date?
Sheldon,Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
Sheldon,Not at all.
Sheldon,"Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?"
Sheldon,"For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!"
Sheldon,A minute.
Sheldon,This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
Sheldon,"The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
Sheldon,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
Sheldon,"Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?"
Sheldon,"It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. "
Sheldon,This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay.  No!
Sheldon,"You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking."
Sheldon,"Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
Sheldon,"No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
Sheldon,"Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
Sheldon,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
Sheldon,"I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him."
Sheldon,"It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage."
Sheldon,"My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?"
Sheldon,"Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
Sheldon,"Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone."
Sheldon,"How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!"
Sheldon,Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. 
Sheldon,"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?"
Sheldon,"Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool."
Sheldon,"I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
Sheldon,"I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
Sheldon,"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
Sheldon,"Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
Sheldon,Where’s Stuart?
Sheldon,Who are you?
Sheldon,"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
Sheldon,"Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"
Sheldon,"Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie."
Sheldon,"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
Sheldon,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
Sheldon,"All right, fine. Let’s just play."
Sheldon,"Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
Sheldon,"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. "
Sheldon,"I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything."
Sheldon,Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
Sheldon,"Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
Sheldon,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
Sheldon,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
Sheldon,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,Penny. 
Sheldon,Penny. 
Sheldon,Penny.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
Sheldon,"A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
Sheldon,No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
Sheldon,"I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
Sheldon,I believe I do.
Sheldon,I’m the guy.
Sheldon,"Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
Sheldon,You tramp.
Sheldon,"Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart."
Sheldon,Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sheldon,"The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart."
Sheldon,"Stuart, please. You’re being rude."
Sheldon,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
Sheldon,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
Sheldon,You’re being impossible.
Sheldon,"Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
Sheldon,"Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids."
Sheldon,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
Sheldon,"I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
Sheldon,Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
Sheldon,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
Sheldon, Bernadette.
Sheldon,I got a splinter.
Sheldon,"Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it."
Sheldon,I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
Sheldon,"In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter."
Sheldon,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
Sheldon,Oh. I thought it was a game.
Sheldon,"Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick."
Sheldon,And that’s how it’s done.
Sheldon,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
Sheldon,"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
Sheldon,Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
Sheldon,"You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
Sheldon,Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
Sheldon,"Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."
Sheldon,"So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?"
Sheldon,I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
Sheldon,"Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?"
Sheldon,"Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it."
Sheldon,And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
Sheldon,"Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?"
Sheldon,My point.
Sheldon,"Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
Sheldon,"The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
Sheldon,"You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
Sheldon,A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
Sheldon,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
Sheldon,You really need to work on your penmanship.
Sheldon,"You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him."
Sheldon,I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
Sheldon,"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
Sheldon,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
Sheldon,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
Sheldon,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
Sheldon,You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
Sheldon,You know what would be nice?
Sheldon,"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it."
Sheldon,Leonard.
Sheldon,"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
Sheldon,You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
Sheldon,"Oh, there it is, tacos."
Sheldon,"I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
Sheldon,"The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back."
Sheldon,"Well said, Boy Wonder."
Sheldon,Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
Sheldon,"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
Sheldon,"I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
Sheldon,This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
Sheldon,A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
Sheldon,"If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion."
Sheldon,"Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose."
Sheldon,It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
Sheldon,"And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?"
Sheldon,"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?"
Sheldon,"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."
Sheldon,"Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers."
Sheldon,"Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
Sheldon,"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here."
Sheldon,"Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination."
Sheldon,"Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things."
Sheldon,What if they simply don’t excite me?
Sheldon,"She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
Sheldon,"It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
Sheldon,No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
Sheldon,"Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material."
Sheldon,Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
Sheldon,I’ll say.
Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
Sheldon,Nuts to that. What else you got?
Sheldon,How does that work?
Sheldon,"Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."
Sheldon,"It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour."
Sheldon,I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
Sheldon,"Ooh, a pocket watch."
Sheldon,"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
Sheldon,"Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
Sheldon," Trust me, we are not a couple."
Sheldon,"Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
Sheldon,Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
Sheldon,What time did you tell Amy to be here?
Sheldon,Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
Sheldon,"Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you."
Sheldon,I told you.
Sheldon,"You’re right, the tiara was too much."
Sheldon,You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
Sheldon,"As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind."
Sheldon,"Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
Sheldon,"Permission granted, Commander."
Sheldon,"Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto."
Sheldon,"Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?"
Sheldon,You want to know my opinion?
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
Sheldon,"It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby."
Sheldon,"It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?"
Sheldon,"And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
Sheldon,We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
Sheldon,"Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand."
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,"Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?"
Sheldon,I was using the bathroom.
Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you in there.
Sheldon,Where?
Sheldon,In your pyjamas?
Sheldon,Without shoes?
Sheldon,On a cold winter’s night?
Sheldon,Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
Sheldon,"Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister."
Sheldon,"After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
Sheldon,"It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?"
Sheldon,Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
Sheldon,It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
Sheldon,"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed."
Sheldon,Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
Sheldon,"We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so."
Sheldon,"You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Sheldon,"Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
Sheldon,"People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order."
Sheldon,I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
Sheldon,"Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry."
Sheldon,This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
Sheldon,"You’re right, I’ll give him a shot."
Sheldon,"No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back."
Sheldon,"Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
Sheldon,Vexillology is the study of flags.
Sheldon,Did you have fun doing it?
Sheldon,"Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more."
Sheldon,Why are you waving a white flag?
Sheldon,"Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…"
Sheldon,Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
Sheldon,And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
Sheldon,"No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
Sheldon,Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
Sheldon,"Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top."
Sheldon,Cut! Take 47.
Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
Sheldon,"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism."
Sheldon,"Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself."
Sheldon,"Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con."
Sheldon,"All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out."
Sheldon,How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
Sheldon,"Well done, Dr. Koothrappali."
Sheldon,You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me."
Sheldon,Kripke.
Sheldon,"Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian."
Sheldon,Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
Sheldon,Flags.
Sheldon,Emergency preparedness drill.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead."
Sheldon,"I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
Sheldon,"Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?"
Sheldon,"All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
Sheldon,"You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,"Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice.  Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
Sheldon,And that’s why we wear hard hats.
Sheldon,"I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day."
Sheldon,You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
Sheldon,"Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico."
Sheldon,"Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter."
Sheldon,"Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”"
Sheldon,"Well, it has. Ask anybody."
Sheldon,Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
Sheldon,"Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘Sup?"
Sheldon,Right here. Use your finger.
Sheldon,"All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
Sheldon,"Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
Sheldon,"Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
Sheldon,"You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?"
Sheldon,"Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?"
Sheldon,What’s that?
Sheldon,"Hello, Stuart."
Sheldon,"No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
Sheldon,"You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?"
Sheldon,"Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?"
Sheldon,And your father? Alive?
Sheldon,"How about your grandparents, they alive?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
Sheldon,"Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
Sheldon,"Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from."
Sheldon,‘Sup?
Sheldon,"Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
Sheldon,"I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
Sheldon,Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
Sheldon,"Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you."
Sheldon,And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
Sheldon,"But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick."
Sheldon,"Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
Sheldon,"Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
Sheldon,I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
Sheldon,"Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
Sheldon,"Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself."
Sheldon,"This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat.  Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water."
Sheldon,What are you proposing?
Sheldon,And how would I do that?
Sheldon,Every time?
Sheldon,"Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day."
Sheldon,"Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day."
Sheldon,"Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number."
Sheldon,Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
Sheldon,And a funny Greek letter.
Sheldon,I said funny.
Sheldon,Good one. And an electrical charge.
Sheldon,Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a 
Sheldon,"Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t."
Sheldon,Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
Sheldon,"Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office."
Sheldon,"You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
Sheldon,I don’t need a vacation.
Sheldon,"But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,Bleeding from my ears.
Sheldon,"I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
Sheldon,Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
Sheldon,"Will they, Leonard? "
Sheldon,And no more singing.
Sheldon,I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
Sheldon,"Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii."
Sheldon,My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
Sheldon,"It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
Sheldon,"One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project."
Sheldon,"Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab."
Sheldon,"Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert."
Sheldon,"Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away."
Sheldon,Way to kill the mood.
Sheldon,"Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!"
Sheldon,"Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
Sheldon,"What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar."
Sheldon,I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
Sheldon,Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
Sheldon,Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
Sheldon,Biologists are mean.
Sheldon,There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
Sheldon,I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
Sheldon,You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
Sheldon,366… 367…
Sheldon,"How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this."
Sheldon,"Aw, nuts! One…"
Sheldon,"This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up."
Sheldon,"Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
Sheldon,Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
Sheldon,"You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too."
Sheldon,All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
Sheldon,"It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
Sheldon,No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. "
Sheldon,I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
Sheldon,"You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on."
Sheldon,"Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those."
Sheldon,"Oh, better than good."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. "
Sheldon, Amy?
Sheldon,"I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week."
Sheldon,I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
Sheldon,That is your opinion.
Sheldon,I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
Sheldon,That my genius…
Sheldon,That the soap was…
Sheldon,Fine. Sorry.
Sheldon,Next year I’m going to Epcot.
Sheldon,These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
Sheldon,"Mm, indeed."
Sheldon,Dibs.
Sheldon,"What are you doing here, Kripke?"
Sheldon,This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
Sheldon,"Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
Sheldon,Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
Sheldon,I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
Sheldon,I’m sorry. We just need a word.
Sheldon,We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
Sheldon,"Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
Sheldon,"Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
Sheldon,Kripke?
Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
Sheldon,"We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea."
Sheldon,Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
Sheldon,Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
Sheldon,"Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
Sheldon,You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
Sheldon,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Sheldon,"Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Sheldon,"Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…"
Sheldon,"Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things."
Sheldon,"Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains."
Sheldon,Five what?
Sheldon,"Hey! He did that on purpose,"
Sheldon,"Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I’m gonna need more force."
Sheldon,What do you propose?
Sheldon,"I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
Sheldon,Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
Sheldon,"Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time."
Sheldon,Yeah. Call first. 
Sheldon,Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
Sheldon,I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
Sheldon,"Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
Sheldon,"Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out."
Sheldon,Is it? Listen.
Sheldon,"No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is."
Sheldon,"Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
Sheldon,"You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?"
Sheldon,"No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
Sheldon,How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
Sheldon,"What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!"
Sheldon,Help! Somebody help!
Sheldon,I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
Sheldon,It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
Sheldon,"Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
Sheldon,Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?"
Sheldon,You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
Sheldon,"He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas."
Sheldon,"When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio."
Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
Sheldon,"No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?"
Sheldon,"To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
Sheldon,"Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. "
Sheldon,Nope. 
Sheldon,Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
Sheldon,I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
Sheldon,Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
Sheldon,"I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob."
Sheldon,"Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it."
Sheldon,I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
Sheldon,"Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
Sheldon,"Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
Sheldon,Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut."
Sheldon,"I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
Sheldon,"No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
Sheldon,"Leonard, explain it to her."
Sheldon,"I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time."
Sheldon,"Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point."
Sheldon,You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
Sheldon,I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos."
Sheldon,Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
Sheldon,Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
Sheldon,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
Sheldon,Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
Sheldon,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
Sheldon,"Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world."
Sheldon,Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
Sheldon,"Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs."
Sheldon,What’s going on?
Sheldon,"Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
Sheldon,"Amy, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
Sheldon,"Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts."
Sheldon,"At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
Sheldon,"That’s okay, I never understood them anyway."
Sheldon,"Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny."
Sheldon,"Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
Sheldon,Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
Sheldon,The online game? Bully!
Sheldon,Just tell her I can’t come.
Sheldon,She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
Sheldon,"Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
Sheldon,I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies."
Sheldon,"Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!"
Sheldon,Hello Stuart.
Sheldon,"Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?"
Sheldon,Do you supply the the tennis ball?
Sheldon,Then no. What else?
Sheldon,"Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for."
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom."
Sheldon,"Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale."
Sheldon,You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
Sheldon, Penny!
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift."
Sheldon,"Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party."
Sheldon,"All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?"
Sheldon,When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
Sheldon,"All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B."
Sheldon,I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
Sheldon,"Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying."
Sheldon,"Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side."
Sheldon,Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
Sheldon,Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hah-hah!"
Sheldon,"Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go."
Sheldon,Hah-hah!
Sheldon,That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
Sheldon,Armin who?
Sheldon,"I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution."
Sheldon,"Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh, grow up, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
Sheldon,"They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts."
Sheldon,"Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
Sheldon,"Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
Sheldon,Quantum physics makes me so happy.
Sheldon,It’s like looking at the universe naked.  
Sheldon,"Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Knock, knock."
Sheldon,Interrupting physicist.
Sheldon,MUON!
Sheldon,"Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!"
Sheldon,Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
Sheldon,Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
Sheldon,"Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure."
Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. No!
Sheldon,They’re mint in box.
Sheldon,Is someone there?
Sheldon,Spock?
Sheldon,Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
Sheldon,Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
Sheldon,But it’s mint in box.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response."
Sheldon,To be played with.
Sheldon,"Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  It’s only logical."
Sheldon,Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
Sheldon,"What is it now, tiny Spock?"
Sheldon,You’re the one who told me to play with it.
Sheldon,"No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave."
Sheldon,"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy."
Sheldon,I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
Sheldon,"You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here."
Sheldon,"Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help."
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t want a broken toy.  Nothing!"
Sheldon,Nothing. I said nothing.
Sheldon,"Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands."
Sheldon,"My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her."
Sheldon,Mmmmm!
Sheldon,"Oh, nice job, man-hands."
Sheldon,"Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart."
Sheldon,"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you."
Sheldon,I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
Sheldon,I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
Sheldon,My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
Sheldon,Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
Sheldon,"Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it."
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it."
Sheldon,"Please, please, please let me meet Hawking."
Sheldon,But I said I’m sorry.
Sheldon,And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
Sheldon,"Um, to go to Jewish heaven?"
Sheldon,Then to avoid Jewish hell?
Sheldon,"Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal."
Sheldon,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
Sheldon,"Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
Sheldon,"Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
Sheldon,How about dolphins?
Sheldon,Oh!
Sheldon,Oh!
Sheldon,Oh!
Sheldon,"Howard, please, I’m begging you."
Sheldon,"Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween."
Sheldon,"No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy."
Sheldon,It’s actually 01100111.
Sheldon,"I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking."
Sheldon,"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me."
Sheldon,"He will, he’s really smart."
Sheldon,How do I do that?
Sheldon,Walking away.
Sheldon,"Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
Sheldon,I wasn’t talking to you.
Sheldon,"Yes, yes. What did you decide?"
Sheldon,"Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific."
Sheldon,What kinds of things?
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,All right. What would you like me to do first?
Sheldon,"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
Sheldon,That’s a lot of belt buckles.
Sheldon,You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
Sheldon,"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
Sheldon,My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
Sheldon,And you want me to return it for you?
Sheldon,What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,This is not my laundry.
Sheldon,Those are Howard’s.
Sheldon,"Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist."
Sheldon,That’s close enough.
Sheldon,"Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…"
Sheldon,"Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone."
Sheldon,Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
Sheldon,"Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle."
Sheldon,I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
Sheldon,I knew it.
Sheldon,"What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?"
Sheldon,What do you want me to do?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!"
Sheldon,"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
Sheldon,Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
Sheldon,"Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,Fine. You have very tiny hands.
Sheldon,You’re obviously good at what you do.
Sheldon,"Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing."
Sheldon,Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
Sheldon,"What, why not?"
Sheldon,"All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience."
Sheldon,"Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
Sheldon,I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,"Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
Sheldon,What do you mean wrong?
Sheldon,"No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking."
Sheldon,"I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it."
Sheldon,Wrong. Leonard?
Sheldon,"Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?"
Sheldon,"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."
Sheldon,"All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight."
Sheldon,"Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
Sheldon,You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
Sheldon,"Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in."
Sheldon,It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
Sheldon,"Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky."
Sheldon,"I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group."
Sheldon,Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody.  Aagh!
Sheldon,"And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend."
Sheldon,Talk to the hand.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!"
Sheldon,Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
Sheldon,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
Sheldon,"Jeepers, I’m drunk."
Sheldon,Here.
Sheldon,You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
Sheldon,"Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds."
Sheldon,I just threw up the bachelor party.
Sheldon,"Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight."
Sheldon,You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
Sheldon,"Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?"
Sheldon,Said the hangman offering a noose.
Sheldon,"Ah, much better."
Sheldon,"A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!"
Sheldon,Keys! Keys! Keys!
Sheldon, Amy?
Sheldon,It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
Sheldon,"I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
Sheldon,What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"
Sheldon,"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
Sheldon,"And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school."
Sheldon,"Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
Sheldon,Super Mario Bros. theme?
Sheldon,"I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work."
Sheldon,"Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
Sheldon,You know I don’t drink.
Sheldon,"I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol."
Sheldon,Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
Sheldon,"Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh."
Sheldon,"Bishop to queen four, level two. Check."
Sheldon,I’m fine.
Sheldon,Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
Sheldon,"No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
Sheldon,"Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies."
Sheldon,"Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
Sheldon,"It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception."
Sheldon,"They let me blow the whistle, Leonard."
Sheldon,I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
Sheldon,"No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?"
Sheldon,I assume we’re talking about you now?
Sheldon,"So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
Sheldon,"Well, no wonder the women are winning."
Sheldon,"I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop."
Sheldon,"289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290."
Sheldon,"Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity."
Sheldon,"Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides."
Sheldon,"Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy."
Sheldon,That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
Sheldon,"It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
Sheldon,He asked her during coitus.
Sheldon,"Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?"
Sheldon,"I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon."
Sheldon,What do you see in her?
Sheldon,You didn’t have to do that.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. I was afraid of this."
Sheldon,"While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
Sheldon,"I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man."
Sheldon,"Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving."
Sheldon,I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
Sheldon,"Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH."
Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry."
Sheldon,And the Klingon High Council…
Sheldon,"Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"I must admit, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case."
Sheldon,"Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same."
Sheldon,"Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
Sheldon,"You don’t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now."
Sheldon,"Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?"
Sheldon,Strongly pro.
Sheldon,"Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
Sheldon,Attaboy!
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?"
Sheldon,"As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy."
Sheldon,"Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us."
Sheldon,"Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out."
Sheldon,Tell him yourself.
Sheldon,I invited him.
Sheldon,"Yes, it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement."
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope that’s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue."
Sheldon,Every time you drink alcohol.
Sheldon,Your point being?
Sheldon,I just had cobbler.
Sheldon,W-Where are you going?
Sheldon,You can’t leave. I need you.
Sheldon,Yes. You’re my ride.
Sheldon,"All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be."
Sheldon,I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.
Sheldon,"Good. Now, I assume we’re splitting the cheque?"
Sheldon,"Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him."
Sheldon,"2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. "
Sheldon,Copy that. Over. 
Sheldon,I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the  then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
Sheldon,That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. 
Sheldon,Over and out. 
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.
Sheldon,That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
Sheldon,"The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six."
Sheldon,Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
Sheldon,"At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets."
Sheldon,"Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you."
Sheldon,Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?
Sheldon,Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.
Sheldon,This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
Sheldon,"Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things."
Sheldon,It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.
Sheldon,Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
Sheldon,Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
Sheldon,"So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?"
Sheldon,"String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?"
Sheldon,"How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose."
Sheldon,"Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?"
Sheldon,"Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head."
Sheldon,"Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him."
Sheldon,I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
Sheldon,"Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you."
Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
Sheldon,I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.
Sheldon,Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.
Sheldon,I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
Sheldon,"Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in."
Sheldon,You do?
Sheldon,That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,Are you sleeping?
Sheldon,Never mind. I still can’t tell you.
Sheldon,
Sheldon,You frightened me.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk."
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice."
Sheldon,Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
Sheldon,"Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper."
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard."
Sheldon,Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
Sheldon,Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
Sheldon,"My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple."
Sheldon,I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
Sheldon,Penny?
Sheldon,Please don’t hurt my friend.
Sheldon,Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
Sheldon,"Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She’s pretty mad."
Sheldon,"All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
Sheldon,"Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."
Sheldon,Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
Sheldon,"Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up."
Sheldon,Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
Sheldon,"But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better."
Sheldon,Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
Sheldon,"Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you, Penny."
Sheldon,"Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles."
Sheldon,"Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child."
Sheldon,"No, that’s my potty training journal."
Sheldon,Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.
Sheldon,"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency."
Sheldon,I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
Sheldon,"Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize."
Sheldon,"Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize."
Sheldon,"Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors."
Sheldon,"That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour."
Sheldon,"Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking."
Sheldon,"You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old."
Sheldon,"You said it, not me."
Sheldon,"All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?"
Sheldon,"Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best."
Sheldon,"Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss."
Sheldon,"I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   I trust you paid off those parking tickets."
Sheldon,"Hearing unimpaired, good."
Sheldon,"Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard."
Sheldon,No. I have people for that now. You’re up.
Sheldon,"Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks."
Sheldon,"Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?"
Sheldon,"Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?"
Sheldon,Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
Sheldon,Two cherries?
Sheldon,Stems removed?
Sheldon,"It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed."
Sheldon,"Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?"
Sheldon,"If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind."
Sheldon,"It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."
Sheldon,I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
Sheldon,The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
Sheldon,Notice people on your own time. We’re working.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership."
Sheldon,"Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker."
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply."
Sheldon,"Welcome aboard, old chum."
Sheldon,"He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero."
Sheldon,"You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight."
Sheldon,"Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened."
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,"Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage."
Sheldon,"Yeah, once again, I know."
Sheldon,Got it.
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?"
Sheldon,"It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present."
Sheldon,It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
Sheldon,It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
Sheldon,It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
Sheldon,"Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome."
Sheldon,There.
Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you."
Sheldon,"Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth."
Sheldon,Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
Sheldon,Don’t know.
Sheldon,I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
Sheldon,Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
Sheldon,All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
Sheldon,"It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?"
Sheldon,"Bueno, mi amigo."
Sheldon,"All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots."
Sheldon,"That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown."
Sheldon,"No, that’s not fair either."
Sheldon,Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
Sheldon,"Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Hurry up, find him, find him."
Sheldon,"For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt."
Sheldon,How could you not find him?
Sheldon,I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
Sheldon,Stop that.
Sheldon,"Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it."
Sheldon,Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
Sheldon,"So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?"
Sheldon,That’s rude.
Sheldon,"Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!"
Sheldon,"For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world."
Sheldon,"Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment."
Sheldon,"It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?"
Sheldon,"Oh, well."
Sheldon,What kind of tea would you like?
Sheldon,Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.
Sheldon,I couldn’t agree more.
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple."
Sheldon,R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
Sheldon,"Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags."
Sheldon,Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?
Sheldon,Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie."
Sheldon,What are you smiling at?
Sheldon,"A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks."
Sheldon,Yes! This party just became a major rager.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.
Sheldon,"Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it."
Sheldon,"Look at that, the problem solved itself."
Sheldon,What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
Sheldon,"No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause."
Sheldon,What’s a hickey?
Sheldon,I should’ve picked hickey.
Sheldon,It was a compromise. I lost.
Sheldon,"Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. "
Sheldon,"Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?"
Sheldon,"I’ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it’s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…"
Sheldon,"Friends! It’s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I’ll have everything I’ve ever wanted since I was six years old."
Sheldon,"And I’m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked."
Sheldon,"And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you’ll be off to the races."
Sheldon,"Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I’ll be Coop. He’ll be Wheels. If he’s okay with that. "
Sheldon,"Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking."
Sheldon,It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.
Sheldon,What’s your point?
Sheldon,"Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That’s right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels."
Sheldon,"Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating."
Sheldon,"Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain."
Sheldon,It’s been three days. Why hasn’t Stephen Hawking played a word?
Sheldon,Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Good Lord, what have I done?"
Sheldon,Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.
Sheldon,Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
Sheldon,Does it affect me?
Sheldon,Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.
Sheldon,Stephen Hawking hates me.
Sheldon,"I was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?"
Sheldon,How would I know? I’m not listening to you.
Sheldon,"I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we’re not friends anymore."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking’s not busy because I can see he’s playing other people right now."
Sheldon,"Wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. But I didn’t know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It’s all Amy’s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I hear you, brother."
Sheldon,"Fine. Women, huh?"
Sheldon,"Blonde women, huh?"
Sheldon,It sucks to be you.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded."
Sheldon,No. It would appear as if I’ve lost him. Stupid brain.
Sheldon,How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a friend.
Sheldon,You’re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.
Sheldon,"Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."
Sheldon,I can’t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
Sheldon,"Oh, but I want to be Hawking’s friend."
Sheldon,"Oh, but if I do, I’ll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser."
Sheldon,"I won’t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true."
Sheldon,"‘Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send."
Sheldon,She sounds exactly like you.
Sheldon,It’s Stephen Hawking.
Sheldon,"Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call."
Sheldon,"Oh, me, too."
Sheldon,"Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir."
Sheldon,"Oh, I love brain teasers."
Sheldon,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can’t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I’m pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,What’s wrong?
Sheldon,"My friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"So, Wil, what do you have for us first?"
Sheldon,"It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me."
Sheldon,"So, Wil, what do you have for us first?"
Sheldon,"Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps."
Sheldon,Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
Sheldon,"Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?"
Sheldon,I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
Sheldon,"Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."
Sheldon,Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?
Sheldon,"Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire."
Sheldon,I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet."
Sheldon,"Yes, quite the kerfuffle."
Sheldon,Walked right out the door.
Sheldon,Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
Sheldon,Why’s that?
Sheldon,You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
Sheldon,"Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close."
Sheldon,"You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry."
Sheldon,"Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?"
Sheldon,"Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day."
Sheldon, Angry Amy.
Sheldon,"I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better."
Sheldon,"First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  She’s hooked."
Sheldon,"Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls."
Sheldon,"Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it."
Sheldon,Will that calm my nerves?
Sheldon,Sold.
Sheldon,"The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle."
Sheldon,"It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek."
Sheldon,"Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party."
Sheldon,I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.
Sheldon,My problem is I’m out of tea.
Sheldon,"Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing."
Sheldon,"On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman."
Sheldon,"Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel."
Sheldon,I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.
Sheldon,"No, she won’t. I’m great."
Sheldon," Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?"
Sheldon,Wouldn’t you like to know?
Sheldon,Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.
Sheldon,I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?
Sheldon,You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
Sheldon,My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.
Sheldon,"Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much."
Sheldon,"You’re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I’ll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me."
Sheldon,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton."
Sheldon,"I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend."
Sheldon,It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
Sheldon,"It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. "
Sheldon,I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Sheldon,"No, thank you."
Sheldon,I’m quite sure. Good day.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,I just told you.
Sheldon,"Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court."
Sheldon,"To be honest, I didn’t know you were here."
Sheldon,You think you don’t care?
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about."
Sheldon,"Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade."
Sheldon,"Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products."
Sheldon,You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
Sheldon,"I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes."
Sheldon,"Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist."
Sheldon,"While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it."
Sheldon,"Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn."
Sheldon,I thought you left a long time ago.
Sheldon,The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
Sheldon,"Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge."
Sheldon,"You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know."
Sheldon,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats."
Sheldon,"If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, 294?"
Sheldon,That’s my parking spot.
Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those."
Sheldon,"I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks."
Sheldon,Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
Sheldon,"I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot."
Sheldon,Very well. You leave me no choice.
Sheldon,"What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"
Sheldon,"No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?"
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?"
Sheldon,"Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , I’m using it."
Sheldon,Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.
Sheldon,Cookie.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not giving it away. "
Sheldon,"He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot."
Sheldon,Get off there.
Sheldon,Give me back my parking space.
Sheldon,You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.
Sheldon,Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here."
Sheldon,"Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge."
Sheldon,"All right, colour me intrigued."
Sheldon,"I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids."
Sheldon,"Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey."
Sheldon,"Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it."
Sheldon,"No, I don’t."
Sheldon,"Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to… "
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?"
Sheldon,"Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that."
Sheldon,No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
Sheldon,"He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence."
Sheldon,"Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do."
Sheldon,"Hey, sweet ride."
Sheldon,Just breaking in your new car.
Sheldon,You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies."
Sheldon,"Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man."
Sheldon,"Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile."
Sheldon,There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.
Sheldon,"Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground."
Sheldon,To burying the hatchet.
Sheldon,"Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle."
Sheldon,"A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?"
Sheldon,"Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will."
Sheldon,Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
Sheldon,Is that your son?
Sheldon,"Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis."
Sheldon,Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
Sheldon,"It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell."
Sheldon,"However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can."
Sheldon,"I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider."
Sheldon,"You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders."
Sheldon,"No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China."
Sheldon,"Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry."
Sheldon,"Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China."
Sheldon,What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
Sheldon, Amy.
Sheldon,"I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
Sheldon,"You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya."
Sheldon,"Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny."
Sheldon," Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being."
Sheldon,You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.
Sheldon,102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
Sheldon,"Well, not with that attitude."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?"
Sheldon,"Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
Sheldon,"How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest."
Sheldon,Yes. All over it.
Sheldon,"Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling."
Sheldon,"No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking."
Sheldon,"Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?"
Sheldon,Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
Sheldon,"I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
Sheldon,"I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
Sheldon,"It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
Sheldon,"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
Sheldon,"In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit."
Sheldon,"Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
Sheldon,I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
Sheldon,Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin."
Sheldon,Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
Sheldon,Maybe I will.
Sheldon,"Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited."
Sheldon,"Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
Sheldon,"Yeah, like a bunch of savages."
Sheldon,A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.
Sheldon,"Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?"
Sheldon,"Actually that helps, thank you."
Sheldon,"Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no."
Sheldon,"Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly."
Sheldon,I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
Sheldon,Lucky.
Sheldon,"I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is."
Sheldon,I open the chest.
Sheldon,"Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia."
Sheldon,"Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol."
Sheldon,"Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even"
Sheldon,"Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel."
Sheldon,"It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos."
Sheldon,"W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…"
Sheldon,"Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum."
Sheldon,I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
Sheldon,Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
Sheldon,"Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture."
Sheldon,What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s like I’m really there."
Sheldon,"Yes. What, is there a problem?"
Sheldon,Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?"
Sheldon,No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift."
Sheldon,All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
Sheldon,Play through the pain.
Sheldon,"But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard."
Sheldon,"You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?"
Sheldon,"My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back."
Sheldon,"Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!"
Sheldon,Santa?
Sheldon,"Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots."
Sheldon,I understand.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope it’s a train."
Sheldon,Two trains?
Sheldon,I’m getting three trains.
Sheldon,"Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…"
Sheldon,"Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical."
Sheldon,"No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive.  Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings."
Sheldon,"Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark."
Sheldon,"Jenga, I win!"
Sheldon,"Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?"
Sheldon,"Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality."
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips."
Sheldon,"I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I’ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies."
Sheldon,"I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names."
Sheldon,"Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally."
Sheldon,"No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady."
Sheldon,No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
Sheldon,"No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?"
Sheldon,"Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things."
Sheldon,"Ladies, ladies, please. We’re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard."
Sheldon,"Well, what should I do?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six."
Sheldon,"Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts."
Sheldon,"Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?"
Sheldon,"Well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?"
Sheldon,Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
Sheldon,"You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day."
Sheldon,Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy."
Sheldon,"So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you."
Sheldon,"I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle."
Sheldon,"Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace."
Sheldon,"Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight."
Sheldon, Human Resources Department.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia."
Sheldon,Like what?
Sheldon,"Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave."
Sheldon,"Well, y-you, I-I’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…"
Sheldon,"I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar."
Sheldon,"Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown."
Sheldon,"Well, hello."
Sheldon,"Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis."
Sheldon,But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
Sheldon,"You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."
Sheldon,"And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to."
Sheldon,"It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology."
Sheldon,"Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad."
Sheldon,"Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost."
Sheldon,"That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place."
Sheldon,"So to answer your question, no, it’s not better."
Sheldon,"It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good."
Sheldon,I think you should turn on the GPS.
Sheldon,But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
Sheldon,"Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you."
Sheldon,I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
Sheldon,"Shh, he said it’s interesting."
Sheldon,"Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there."
Sheldon,"Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does."
Sheldon,None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.
Sheldon,"I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes."
Sheldon,Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.
Sheldon,Stealing is against the law!
Sheldon,Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.
Sheldon,What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
Sheldon,You’re right. Nice going.
Sheldon,Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."
Sheldon,"What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?"
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective."
Sheldon,"Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…"
Sheldon,I hate this planet.
Sheldon,"Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?"
Sheldon,"Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you."
Sheldon,"Actually, it’s three against one."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now."
Sheldon,"Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside."
Sheldon,There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
Sheldon,"Captain, what are your orders?"
Sheldon,Wait. They might be hostile.
Sheldon,"I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics."
Sheldon,Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
Sheldon,Don’t waste my time.
Sheldon,"A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!"
Sheldon,Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.
Sheldon,"That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?"
Sheldon,"So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones."
Sheldon,That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
Sheldon,"There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay."
Sheldon,Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.
Sheldon,"Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?"
Sheldon,"See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair."
Sheldon,"Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!"
Sheldon,"And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke."
Sheldon,Why don’t you show me yours first.
Sheldon,How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
Sheldon,"Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry."
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,I’m fine.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy."
Sheldon,What do we have to lose?
Sheldon,I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?
Sheldon,I can’t go in today. I’m sick.
Sheldon,"No, look."
Sheldon,See?
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you."
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough."
Sheldon,"All right, geez. What a grouch."
Sheldon,"I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand."
Sheldon,We do?
Sheldon,So?
Sheldon,Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.
Sheldon,"What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis."
Sheldon,"I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic"
Sheldon,"Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive."
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,That’s awfully personal.
Sheldon,"Well, word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling."
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy."
Sheldon,"Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable."
Sheldon,It’s a possibility.
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,"Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…"
Sheldon,I didn’t notice.
Sheldon,I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
Sheldon,Can we get back to work?
Sheldon,Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
Sheldon,"That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either."
Sheldon,"You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn."
Sheldon,Good.
Sheldon,"Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?"
Sheldon,"Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman."
Sheldon,"There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady."
Sheldon,"What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible."
Sheldon,"Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do."
Sheldon,You pick that up right now.
Sheldon,"Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground."
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,Crazy bastard?
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait."
Sheldon,Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
Sheldon,One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.
Sheldon,One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That’s Leonard’s.
Sheldon,"One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it."
Sheldon,"Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?"
Sheldon,"Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him."
Sheldon,Exactly.
Sheldon,"That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked."
Sheldon,Wait. Here who is where?
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon, Good buddy Leonard.
Sheldon,"Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing."
Sheldon,"Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy."
Sheldon,"Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for."
Sheldon,"Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,"Hello, home wrecker."
Sheldon,"You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it."
Sheldon,Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
Sheldon,You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
Sheldon,"Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?"
Sheldon,That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
Sheldon,"I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair."
Sheldon,Is it kung pao chicken?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white rice?"
Sheldon,Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
Sheldon,"Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, why would you?"
Sheldon,Hello. This is Sheldon.
Sheldon,We’re not home right now.
Sheldon,You can’t live here.
Sheldon,No. It’s not the message.
Sheldon,You did.
Sheldon,It’s Penny’s fault.
Sheldon,"She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy."
Sheldon,"I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard, and you know it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I think we should talk about that."
Sheldon,I thought we were talking about the other thing.
Sheldon,"Well, the evidence does support that."
Sheldon,Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
Sheldon,Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
Sheldon,Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.
Sheldon,"So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste."
Sheldon,"Oh, you caught that, did you?"
Sheldon,"Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things."
Sheldon,"Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go."
Sheldon,"Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off."
Sheldon,"Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?"
Sheldon,Next.
Sheldon,Mmm.
Sheldon,But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.
Sheldon,"Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh."
Sheldon,"Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable."
Sheldon,I think I’ll keep it for myself.
Sheldon,It’s too late. I call dibs.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
Sheldon,"Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day."
Sheldon,What is that?
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,More than anything.
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today."
Sheldon,"No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it."
Sheldon,Read it.
Sheldon,At the bottom.
Sheldon,"Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?"
Sheldon,"It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend."
Sheldon,Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.
Sheldon,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She’s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny."
Sheldon,"So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Well, you came to the right place."
Sheldon,What’s wrong?
Sheldon,Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
Sheldon,Right. And which one do I want?
Sheldon,"If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?"
Sheldon,"Gosh, Penny, what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in."
Sheldon,Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
Sheldon,"Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online."
Sheldon,Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
Sheldon,I know. I’m still learning to control it.
Sheldon,Why would I do that?
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,"No. I didn’t start yet, it’s fine."
Sheldon,"Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night  Penny."
Sheldon,"Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?"
Sheldon,"Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny."
Sheldon,"She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don’t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river."
Sheldon,"Oh, so many crazy rules."
Sheldon," Penny. Oh yeah, much better."
Sheldon,"Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I’m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I’ll go to your dopey play."
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,"Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?"
Sheldon,"All right. I don’t want to, but at least that makes sense."
Sheldon,"You know, I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin."
Sheldon,"Oh, brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger."
Sheldon,Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I’m just funnin’ ya.
Sheldon,"All right, let’s get this stupid play over with."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Aw, for Pete’s sake. Can we go now?"
Sheldon,"It’s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won’t need this. "
Sheldon,She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
Sheldon,She’s remarkable.
Sheldon,"How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?"
Sheldon,I got the B word.
Sheldon,"If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time."
Sheldon,Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
Sheldon,I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
Sheldon,"I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals."
Sheldon,"Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work."
Sheldon,Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
Sheldon,"I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana."
Sheldon,We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
Sheldon,"No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point."
Sheldon,How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
Sheldon,"Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town."
Sheldon,All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
Sheldon,"Some people are otters, some people are rocks."
Sheldon,"Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it."
Sheldon,How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
Sheldon,"This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut."
Sheldon,Smart. We don’t want any problems.
Sheldon,"Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?"
Sheldon,"Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?"
Sheldon,Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
Sheldon,Heard you the first time.
Sheldon,"Oh, you shouldn’t have."
Sheldon,"No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own."
Sheldon,"Well, now don’t you feel silly."
Sheldon,"Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"
Sheldon,"Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami."
Sheldon,"Oh, five more minutes."
Sheldon,How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay."
Sheldon,"Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?"
Sheldon,You health nuts kill me.
Sheldon,"Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…"
Sheldon,"Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…"
Sheldon,"Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?"
Sheldon,Thanks. Oh. Great party.
Sheldon,Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
Sheldon,"Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?"
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me."
Sheldon,I did.
Sheldon,I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Sheldon,"Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets."
Sheldon,"Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely."
Sheldon,"Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?"
Sheldon,"Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets."
Sheldon,"Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father."
Sheldon,I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Sheldon,"Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us."
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today."
Sheldon,My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
Sheldon,"If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?"
Sheldon,"Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir."
Sheldon,I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
Sheldon,"It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once."
Sheldon,"Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence."
Sheldon,It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
Sheldon,Don’t.
Sheldon,Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
Sheldon,I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
Sheldon,Don’t.
Sheldon,"You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages."
Sheldon,There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
Sheldon,Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
Sheldon,"Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?"
Sheldon,"Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy."
Sheldon,"If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with that."
Sheldon,"If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."
Sheldon,Pchew!
Sheldon,"Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that."
Sheldon,Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
Sheldon,"While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off."
Sheldon,Mm-hmm.
Sheldon,"Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running."
Sheldon,My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.
Sheldon,"Or, the chainsaw."
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
Sheldon,"But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear."
Sheldon,Well…
Sheldon,Even you. You’re a slave.
Sheldon,"I’m not sure, it could go either way."
Sheldon,"Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift."
Sheldon,It’s too late. Get ready to like me.
Sheldon,The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
Sheldon,"Um… Well… You are black, right?"
Sheldon,"Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan."
Sheldon,Barely knew him.
Sheldon,"I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you."
Sheldon,"First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman."
Sheldon,"Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there."
Sheldon,"Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful."
Sheldon,"Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,Sad.
Sheldon,Glad.
Sheldon,Bad. However…
Sheldon,Fine. Bad.
Sheldon,You’re here.
Sheldon,So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
Sheldon,What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
Sheldon,What? Did she do it yet?
Sheldon,"Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out."
Sheldon,Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
Sheldon,"Okay, because that was not clear."
Sheldon,What? That was ambiguous.
Sheldon,Um…
Sheldon,"Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother."
Sheldon,"I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar."
Sheldon,What do you think I should do?
Sheldon,"I don’t want any more, but let’s go."
Sheldon,"Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
Sheldon, Mrs Davis? I know you’re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
Sheldon,"I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
Sheldon,"I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude."
Sheldon,"No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate."
Sheldon,"Anyway, thank you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, sister."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?"
Sheldon,Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.
Sheldon,Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?
Sheldon,I’m deleting it.
Sheldon,"No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts."
Sheldon,"Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger."
Sheldon,Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?
Sheldon,"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."
Sheldon,No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
Sheldon,I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure."
Sheldon,"Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing."
Sheldon,I take issue with the word compulsive.
Sheldon,"…tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?"
Sheldon,By playing tic-tac-toe?
Sheldon,"Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win.  B-But we didn’t finish."
Sheldon,The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
Sheldon,"Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
Sheldon,You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Let’s box it up.
Sheldon,"Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead."
Sheldon,"Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
Sheldon,"Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…"
Sheldon,"Doesn’t matter, does it?"
Sheldon,And a complete sucker.
Sheldon,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,"Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!"
Sheldon,"Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him."
Sheldon,"Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m e-mailing him right now."
Sheldon,Of course I do.
Sheldon,"It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house."
Sheldon,And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
Sheldon,"As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin."
Sheldon,"Yeah, that, too. Big cheque."
Sheldon,I’m getting worried.
Sheldon,"Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress.  It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye."
Sheldon,The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
Sheldon,"Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends."
Sheldon,Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
Sheldon,I am.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur."
Sheldon,"Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
Sheldon,"Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!"
Sheldon,It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Potato clock. Do potato clock.
Sheldon,"What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away."
Sheldon,"Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best."
Sheldon,"Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446"
Sheldon,"I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?"
Sheldon,"Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up."
Sheldon,"But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders."
Sheldon,I’ll do it.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,"Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever."
Sheldon,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Sheldon,Want me to sing it again?
Sheldon,"There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?"
Sheldon,Name it.
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re not. You look awful."
Sheldon,Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Sheldon,"Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods."
Sheldon,"But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?"
Sheldon,"So, in a way it’s like I’m your son."
Sheldon,Father.
Sheldon,Dungeons & Dragons.
Sheldon,"I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell."
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?"
Sheldon,I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me."
Sheldon,"As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes."
Sheldon,"Go on, give him your lunch money."
Sheldon,"He does sound effects, too!"
Sheldon,"Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. "
Sheldon,"Ah, that’s my girl."
Sheldon,"It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?"
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before."
Sheldon,I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
Sheldon,"Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment."
Sheldon,"Okay, literal goose bumps. Look."
Sheldon,I ready my quarter-staff.
Sheldon,"Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points."
Sheldon,That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
Sheldon,Yay!
Sheldon,"Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
Sheldon,The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.
Sheldon,Wait. Wait. And says?
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight."
Sheldon,Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
Sheldon,"Oh, then I’m out."
Sheldon,You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
Sheldon,I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
Sheldon,Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
Sheldon,"Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
Sheldon,And now what?
Sheldon,I have not ruled it out.
Sheldon,"I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
Sheldon,"More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together."
Sheldon,"Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through."
Sheldon,"I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off."
Sheldon,What do you do?
Sheldon,I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.
Sheldon,I erotically caress your  nose.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."
Sheldon,"Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
Sheldon,"Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim."
Sheldon,"Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
Sheldon,"No one asked you, Uhura."
Sheldon,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
Sheldon,Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
Sheldon,"Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting."
Sheldon,"I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning."
Sheldon,"Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
Sheldon,"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
Sheldon,"Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy."
Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll do it."
Sheldon,"This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
Sheldon,"You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches."
Sheldon,"It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions."
Sheldon,I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
Sheldon,It was you.
Sheldon,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
Sheldon,They lie so they don’t look petty.
Sheldon,How?
Sheldon,Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
Sheldon,"Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him."
Sheldon,"Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
Sheldon,"Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law."
Sheldon,"All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made."
Sheldon,"It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move."
Sheldon,"Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs."
Sheldon,"Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case."
Sheldon,"So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?"
Sheldon,"You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?"
Sheldon,"This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
Sheldon,No!
Sheldon, Penny. 
Sheldon,"Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed."
Sheldon,"To be honest, I did."
Sheldon,Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
Sheldon,"No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it."
Sheldon,You’re welcome. Good night.
Sheldon,"Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way."
Sheldon,"Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace."
Sheldon,"I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
Sheldon,"Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…"
Sheldon,"Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess."
Sheldon,You overestimate his significance in my life.
Sheldon,Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? 
Sheldon,"Well, I try."
Sheldon,Great. I’ll go first.
Sheldon,"By the way, how are you with zippers?"
Sheldon,"Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus."
Sheldon,Ooh. Bad move.
Sheldon,My queen can now take your rook from below.
Sheldon,"If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun."
Sheldon,We’re all out of alcohol.
Sheldon,"Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island."
Sheldon,"Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
Sheldon,Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
Sheldon,Are you in danger?
Sheldon,You were.
Sheldon,That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
Sheldon,Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
Sheldon,"Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all."
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"
Sheldon,"Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
Sheldon,"Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
Sheldon,"Oh, seriously?"
Sheldon,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
Sheldon,"Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess."
Sheldon,All right. In 4D chess…
Sheldon,I own nine pairs of pants.
Sheldon,I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
Sheldon,"But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand."
Sheldon,I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
Sheldon,"And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave."
Sheldon,"Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not."
Sheldon,"Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter."
Sheldon,Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
Sheldon,"I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
Sheldon,It is to me; that’s the point.
Sheldon,Your apology is accepted.
Sheldon,How about a hearty handshake?
Sheldon,Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
Sheldon,And here’s another interesting weather fact.
Sheldon,"Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
Sheldon,"Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
Sheldon,"I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence."
Sheldon,That criticism will come later in your report card.
Sheldon,"Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something."
Sheldon,"Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
Sheldon,"Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart."
Sheldon,I’m a real collector. How rare is it?
Sheldon,Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman. 
Sheldon,Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.
Sheldon,"Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun."
Sheldon,Oh.
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. "
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns."
Sheldon,"Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport."
Sheldon,"What, now, do you have company?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I can take a look at it."
Sheldon,"I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
Sheldon,"That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
Sheldon,Of course. Ask a silly question. 
Sheldon,That’s odd.
Sheldon,There are takeout containers in the trash can.
Sheldon,What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!"
Sheldon,Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
Sheldon,"Yes, I am."
Sheldon,"Uh, elephant?"
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.
Sheldon,I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
Sheldon,"She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
Sheldon,"Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can."
Sheldon,I hear a woman’s voice.
Sheldon,"No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing."
Sheldon,"There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants."
Sheldon,"Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. "
Sheldon,Aha. 
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,Right.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room."
Sheldon,Amy?
Sheldon,"Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
Sheldon,"No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny."
Sheldon,You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
Sheldon,"Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me."
Sheldon,"Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt."
Sheldon,"Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true."
Sheldon,"You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?"
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll give you that one."
Sheldon,I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
Sheldon,I wish I could believe you.
Sheldon,"You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
Sheldon,Keep it up?
Sheldon,Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
Sheldon,Thought I heard you out here.
Sheldon,You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.
Sheldon,You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
Sheldon,I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?
Sheldon,"Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy. "
Sheldon,Yes. You’re either with me or against me.
Sheldon,Maybe there’s a third option.
Sheldon,"Howard, Raj. Judas."
Sheldon,"A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
Sheldon,Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
Sheldon,I suppose so.
Sheldon,"And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. "
Sheldon,"And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too."
Sheldon,"Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it."
Sheldon,Think of me when you apply it.
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,"I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Come on.
Sheldon,"That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
Sheldon,"Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
Sheldon,"Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
Sheldon,He is a born showman.
Sheldon,"No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school. "
Sheldon,"Oh, see? Now he gets it."
Sheldon,Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
Sheldon,"Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?"
Sheldon,"It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting."
Sheldon,What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time."
Sheldon,But we haven’t finished the puzzle.
Sheldon,"You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?"
Sheldon,"Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store."
Sheldon,It’s the comic book store.
Sheldon,"It is a marathon, not a sprint."
Sheldon,Not with a bowling ball on their back.
Sheldon,Got it.
Sheldon,I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
Sheldon,The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
Sheldon,"Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?"
Sheldon,"Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."
Sheldon,"And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…"
Sheldon,Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.
Sheldon,"No one likes a know-it-all, Penny."
Sheldon,"Okay, another 30 feet."
Sheldon,Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.
Sheldon,To the planetarium.
Sheldon,It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.
Sheldon,Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
Sheldon,I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.
Sheldon,"Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt."
Sheldon,"Hey, that’s my shirt."
Sheldon,"No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s clever."
Sheldon,Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
Sheldon,So what’d you think?
Sheldon,That’s it? Good”
Sheldon,"My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites."
Sheldon,"Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
Sheldon,"I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
Sheldon,"Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die."
Sheldon,"Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works."
Sheldon,Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
Sheldon,"And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?"
Sheldon,"Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes."
Sheldon,"Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I."
Sheldon,"Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?"
Sheldon,Yes. Why?
Sheldon,"April 13, a dark night, indeed."
Sheldon,I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
Sheldon,"Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie."
Sheldon,"Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?"
Sheldon,"Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler."
Sheldon,"Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?"
Sheldon,"Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner."
Sheldon,"That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous."
Sheldon,"Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
Sheldon,"Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.
Sheldon,That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon."
Sheldon,"If you do that, I’ll scream."
Sheldon,"That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one."
Sheldon,"You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win."
Sheldon,"Well, why wouldn’t I be?"
Sheldon,"My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm."
Sheldon,"Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady."
Sheldon,Why not? Hairy Fairy.
Sheldon,That’s a Raging Ogre.
Sheldon,"Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
Sheldon,Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
Sheldon,"Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Sheldon,"Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
Sheldon,"Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
Sheldon,"Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?"
Sheldon,"Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public."
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
Sheldon,"Well, then, you have my permission."
Sheldon,Too late. No backsies.
Sheldon,"Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good."
Sheldon,"Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries."
Sheldon,"Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you."
Sheldon,"Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?"
Sheldon,"Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
Sheldon,"It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?"
Sheldon,Dr. Fowler?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!"
Sheldon,"Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?"
Sheldon,"So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
Sheldon,What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
Sheldon,Aw. Embarrassed you?
Sheldon,I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
Sheldon,"Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…"
Sheldon,"Well, now, that."
Sheldon,Bleugh!
Sheldon,"Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop."
Sheldon,Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
Sheldon,"Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
Sheldon,"I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice."
Sheldon,"Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?"
Sheldon,But you didn’t even hear the details.
Sheldon,But you don’t even know…
Sheldon,"But, now, but in my defence…"
Sheldon,You’re not listening to my side of it.
Sheldon,Well…
Sheldon, Amy.
Sheldon,"I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
Sheldon,"Well, I cannot give this stuff away."
Sheldon,"Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
Sheldon,"I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
Sheldon,"My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all."
Sheldon,"Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it."
Sheldon,Can’t talk. In the zone.
Sheldon,"Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care."
Sheldon,Really don’t care.
Sheldon,When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
Sheldon,"Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone."
Sheldon,Zone.
Sheldon,"Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
Sheldon,"Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
Sheldon,"Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. "
Sheldon,"Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line."
Sheldon,"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been."
Sheldon,"Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element."
Sheldon,"Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery."
Sheldon,"And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
Sheldon,"Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
Sheldon,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
Sheldon,"No. No, no, no, no."
Sheldon,I’ve made a horrible mistake.
Sheldon,"This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?"
Sheldon,"Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about."
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
Sheldon,"What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud."
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist."
Sheldon,There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve. 
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
Sheldon,"You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
Sheldon,"And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, they found the element.  No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?"
Sheldon,The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
Sheldon,I know. When will this nightmare end?
Sheldon,You’re not?
Sheldon,That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.
Sheldon,"Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort."
Sheldon,"I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise."
Sheldon,She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?
Sheldon,"Is it me, or does she not look so good?"
Sheldon,"She’s sick, I knew it. Bye."
Sheldon,I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
Sheldon,You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you. 
Sheldon,"Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."
Sheldon,Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash. 
Sheldon,"Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?"
Sheldon,"Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello."
Sheldon,"I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him."
Sheldon,"Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age."
Sheldon,"This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children."
Sheldon,"So, what prescription are you getting filled?"
Sheldon,"No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me."
Sheldon,"No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
Sheldon,"But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is."
Sheldon,Goody. What’s it say?
Sheldon,"That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me."
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
Sheldon,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
Sheldon,"Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
Sheldon,That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
Sheldon,"Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
Sheldon,"That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,"No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying."
Sheldon,"Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right."
Sheldon, Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, did I wake you?"
Sheldon,"Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars."
Sheldon,It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
Sheldon,"Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry."
Sheldon,"No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you."
Sheldon,"Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead."
Sheldon,"So, uh, what do you say?"
Sheldon,"It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying. "
Sheldon,"Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it. "
Sheldon,"Well, that really hurt. "
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here."
Sheldon,"Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model."
Sheldon,"No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go."
Sheldon,Arthur?
Sheldon,I’m surprised to see you here.
Sheldon,I’ll get Leonard.
Sheldon,"If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy."
Sheldon,Thank you. It would be an honour.
Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
Sheldon,"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. "
Sheldon,"Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. "
Sheldon,Can I invite you in for tea?
Sheldon,"Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?"
Sheldon,"Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it."
Sheldon,"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up."
Sheldon,"None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
Sheldon,I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
Sheldon,"Well, you barely looked. Let me see."
Sheldon,"Leonard, let me look in the box."
Sheldon,Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.
Sheldon,"That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?"
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,I believe you.
Sheldon,I said I would.
Sheldon,"Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch."
Sheldon,You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
Sheldon,"How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it."
Sheldon,You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. 
Sheldon,Put it on. Let’s share the experience.
Sheldon,"Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago."
Sheldon,"How those nipples feeling, chief?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler."
Sheldon,I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
Sheldon,Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
Sheldon,"This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?"
Sheldon,"Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
Sheldon,I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
Sheldon,"The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
Sheldon,"There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
Sheldon,"Please. Ha-ha, Oh."
Sheldon,How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
Sheldon,There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
Sheldon,"Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
Sheldon,"Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon."
Sheldon,"You know, it might be fun. You love hummus."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out."
Sheldon,"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."
Sheldon,"I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
Sheldon,I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
Sheldon,"Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it."
Sheldon,"Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
Sheldon,"Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
Sheldon,"Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
Sheldon,"Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you."
Sheldon,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
Sheldon,Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,He’s right.
Sheldon,"Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?"
Sheldon,Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
Sheldon,"Yes, Miss Amy."
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head."
Sheldon,Hah!Penny? Next.
Sheldon,"It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…"
Sheldon,"I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her."
Sheldon,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
Sheldon,My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
Sheldon,"I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
Sheldon,I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
Sheldon,1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
Sheldon,So was my dad. And then he did.
Sheldon,No. He died when I was 14.
Sheldon,So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
Sheldon,"No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
Sheldon,"All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time."
Sheldon,She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
Sheldon,"Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate."
Sheldon,Ain’t she great? 
Sheldon,"Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?"
Sheldon,This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
Sheldon,I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.
Sheldon,Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television."
Sheldon,"President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins."
Sheldon,"Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."
Sheldon,But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
Sheldon,"Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub."
Sheldon,Do you have cookies?
Sheldon,Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
Sheldon,Why are you here?
Sheldon,"Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque."
Sheldon,"Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad."
Sheldon,How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?
Sheldon,"That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is."
Sheldon,I do see what you’re saying. That helps.
Sheldon,Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
Sheldon,"Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch."
Sheldon,You should probably go.
Sheldon,"Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard."
Sheldon,I’m in a great mood.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,So no more interviews?
Sheldon,I can’t believe it.
Sheldon,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
Sheldon,"I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too."
Sheldon,"By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
Sheldon,"That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,"
Sheldon,Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
Sheldon,"That’s it, I’m down to seven friends."
Sheldon,"When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world."
Sheldon,"Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy."
Sheldon,"I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree."
Sheldon,"No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."
Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Sheldon,I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
Sheldon,Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy."
Sheldon,"You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back."
Sheldon,What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
Sheldon,"I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse."
Sheldon,It probably won’t.
Sheldon,"Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
Sheldon,"Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?"
Sheldon,I believe I can answer that.
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,"You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…"
Sheldon,"That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium."
Sheldon,What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
Sheldon,"Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio."
Sheldon,"You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out."
Sheldon,Texas.
Sheldon,Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
Sheldon,"No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper."
Sheldon,"Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?"
Sheldon,Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
Sheldon,"Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes."
Sheldon,The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me? 
Sheldon,That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
Sheldon,<i>She went into labor an hour ago.
Sheldon,"No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available."
Sheldon,And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
Sheldon,"Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt."
Sheldon,"No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things."
Sheldon,Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.
Sheldon,Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified."
Sheldon,"A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about."
Sheldon,To what?
Sheldon,I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
Sheldon,"Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. "
Sheldon,"Actually, much better."
Sheldon,I don’t know. I just got back. 
Sheldon,"My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude."
Sheldon,That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this."
Sheldon,"Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control."
Sheldon,You okay?
Sheldon,"Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on."
Sheldon,"To quote Han Solo, I know."
Sheldon,I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
Sheldon,Or instead of me.
Sheldon,I did. 
Sheldon,"Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office."
Sheldon,"We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to."
Sheldon,"Yay, Penny."
Sheldon,Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
Sheldon,"I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t."
Sheldon,"Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you think I’m funny?"
Sheldon,I think I’m hysterical.
Sheldon,The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object. 
Sheldon,"Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
Sheldon,"Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd."
Sheldon,I don’t get it.
Sheldon,"I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this."
Sheldon,I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,"Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost."
Sheldon,I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
Sheldon,"This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. "
Sheldon,BRAIN LESIONS!
Sheldon,Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
Sheldon,Excellent.
Sheldon,Kumquat?
Sheldon,Ointment?
Sheldon,"Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
Sheldon,Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
Sheldon,All of them.
Sheldon,Who’s in the mood to laugh?
Sheldon,But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
Sheldon,"So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?"
Sheldon,Should I follow you?
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait."
Sheldon,I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
Sheldon,Can’t sleep?
Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it?
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,Does that mean the relationship is over?
Sheldon,Why don’t you ask her?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry."
Sheldon,"No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry."
Sheldon,No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
Sheldon,It’s an outrage.
Sheldon,"The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it."
Sheldon,"You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
Sheldon,But I don’t want a vacation.
Sheldon,"Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry."
Sheldon,"Come on, take me to work with you."
Sheldon,Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
Sheldon,No. I was just tricking you.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Take me with you."
Sheldon,Please.
Sheldon,Too bad. I’m coming with you.
Sheldon,But.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,I’m on vacation. What do you think?
Sheldon,Leonard told me to stay.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,"Well, have fun."
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.
Sheldon,Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
Sheldon,Let me guess.
Sheldon,What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
Sheldon,"A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
Sheldon,Do you see me drinking lemonade?
Sheldon,Why do you ask?
Sheldon,"No, I don’t think you are. "
Sheldon,"The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
Sheldon,"Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers."
Sheldon,I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
Sheldon,Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
Sheldon,"Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda."
Sheldon,Namaste.
Sheldon,I’m willing to if you guys are.
Sheldon,"Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?"
Sheldon,Penny?
Sheldon,Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.
Sheldon,"Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22. "
Sheldon,"He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?"
Sheldon,I’m fine with it.
Sheldon,"Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw."
Sheldon,"Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face."
Sheldon,"Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants."
Sheldon,"Every year. I told you, wear a diaper."
Sheldon,"It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Do not stop refreshing your screens.
Sheldon,Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
Sheldon,"Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL."
Sheldon,"Not Sunday, I love Sunday."
Sheldon,"It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me."
Sheldon,I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention."
Sheldon,"I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
Sheldon,How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
Sheldon,"You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off."
Sheldon,I didn’t even get to that part.
Sheldon,"Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard."
Sheldon,You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
Sheldon,"No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
Sheldon,"I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader."
Sheldon,"Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…"
Sheldon,"You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum… "
Sheldon,"Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker."
Sheldon,"He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is."
Sheldon,"Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?"
Sheldon,So messed up.
Sheldon,"Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
Sheldon,Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
Sheldon,Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
Sheldon,"Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night."
Sheldon,"Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think."
Sheldon,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
Sheldon,"Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
Sheldon,I don’t understand what we’re doing.
Sheldon,Whose house is this?
Sheldon,Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
Sheldon,Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
Sheldon,"Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,Ay-yi-yi. 
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?"
Sheldon,I submitted you a notarised list. 
Sheldon,"Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please."
Sheldon,"Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey."
Sheldon,"People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
Sheldon,"I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a."
Sheldon,"For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk."
Sheldon,What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
Sheldon,"Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
Sheldon,Vintage? Be specific.
Sheldon,"Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good."
Sheldon,"Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
Sheldon,"Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
Sheldon,It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
Sheldon,"I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard."
Sheldon,"Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Sheldon,Get out of town.
Sheldon,"Do another one, do another one."
Sheldon,"It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo."
Sheldon,How many trains have you been on?
Sheldon,Wow. Your life’s amazing.
Sheldon,You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
Sheldon,Trick question. There never was one.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? 
Sheldon,"I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?"
Sheldon,I never want this day to end.
Sheldon,Come on.
Sheldon,The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. 
Sheldon,"Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.
Sheldon,How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
Sheldon,I get it.
Sheldon,What is your problem?
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
Sheldon,"Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win."
Sheldon,"Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic."
Sheldon,"Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing."
Sheldon,Do you want to come with me?
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,It was wonderful. 
Sheldon,"I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
Sheldon,Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
Sheldon,I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
Sheldon,"I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right."
Sheldon,"Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches."
Sheldon,You’ll get ’em next time.
Sheldon,No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.
Sheldon,Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
Sheldon,"Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result."
Sheldon,"You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98."
Sheldon,"I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install."
Sheldon,"Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home."
Sheldon,"It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it."
Sheldon,"You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without."
Sheldon,Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
Sheldon,"But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats."
Sheldon,"Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset."
Sheldon,My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.
Sheldon,You’re absolutely right. Nope.
Sheldon,"So, when can we get rid of it?"
Sheldon,"What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there."
Sheldon,Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.
Sheldon,"I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals."
Sheldon,That’s not true.
Sheldon,She told you?
Sheldon,"You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality."
Sheldon,"No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
Sheldon,"No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now."
Sheldon," Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare."
Sheldon,"At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this."
Sheldon,It doesn’t?
Sheldon,"Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?"
Sheldon,It is hideous.
Sheldon,Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
Sheldon,Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
Sheldon,How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
Sheldon,"Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me."
Sheldon,Which I also figured out by myself.
Sheldon,"Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
Sheldon,"Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was."
Sheldon,Um.
Sheldon,I don’t need to explain myself to you!
Sheldon,Keep the table. We don’t use that space.
Sheldon,"No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad."
Sheldon,"Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins."
Sheldon,How about Penny’s depressing acting career?
Sheldon,She does. 42 minutes in.
Sheldon,I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.
Sheldon,"Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?"
Sheldon,Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.
Sheldon,"Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye."
Sheldon,"Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it."
Sheldon,"I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman."
Sheldon,"Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over."
Sheldon,"In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Sheldon,Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
Sheldon,"That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
Sheldon,I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
Sheldon,I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Sheldon,Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America."
Sheldon,Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
Sheldon,"Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…"
Sheldon,"Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out."
Sheldon,"Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard."
Sheldon,"Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you."
Sheldon,"It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, very much so."
Sheldon,"Oh, who’s the real astronaut?"
Sheldon,Oh. Yay.
Sheldon, Howard?
Sheldon,I have to go to the bathroom.
Sheldon,"But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt."
Sheldon,"I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago."
Sheldon,Why are you getting annoyed?
Sheldon,Like when?
Sheldon,"Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me."
Sheldon,Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?
Sheldon,But I still need to use the bathroom.
Sheldon,"No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
Sheldon,I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!
Sheldon,I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
Sheldon,"If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life."
Sheldon,Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,In a minute.
Sheldon,Thank you for my bobble head.
Sheldon,It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
Sheldon,I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
Sheldon,"Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later."
Sheldon,"But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you."
Sheldon,"Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now."
Sheldon,Nothing.
Sheldon,I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
Sheldon,I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
Sheldon,No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?"
Sheldon,"No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho."
Sheldon,"Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip."
Sheldon,"I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote."
Sheldon,"Okay, let’s do this."
Sheldon,"You, aren’t you gonna come with me?"
Sheldon, Mother?
Sheldon,I saw you having naked sex.
Sheldon,"Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man."
Sheldon,Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
Sheldon,Who was he?
Sheldon,How long have you been involved with him?
Sheldon,"And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
Sheldon,"Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas."
Sheldon,Or what?
Sheldon,That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
Sheldon,But I occupy the moral high ground.
Sheldon,But I’m a professional scientist.
Sheldon,I’m a grown man.
Sheldon,Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
Sheldon,No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
Sheldon,"Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe."
Sheldon,I didn’t know she did.
Sheldon,What did you do?
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why."
Sheldon,You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,I am.
Sheldon,"I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?"
Sheldon,Then why are you doing it?
Sheldon,"Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance."
Sheldon,"Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore."
Sheldon,"My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex."
Sheldon,"Well, someone has to."
Sheldon,"No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now."
Sheldon,"Boy, do I have to urinate."
Sheldon,Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
Sheldon,I can’t.
Sheldon,"Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?"
Sheldon,"I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."
Sheldon,Here come the waterworks.
Sheldon,"So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."
Sheldon,"You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard."
Sheldon,Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
Sheldon,"Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating."
Sheldon,"No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included."
Sheldon,"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory."
Sheldon,See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
Sheldon,Xbox.
Sheldon,"No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types."
Sheldon,Thank you again for dinner.
Sheldon,Good night.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?"
Sheldon,"Well, they do."
Sheldon,"Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?"
Sheldon,Penny?
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,Wolowitz?
Sheldon,Bernadette?
Sheldon,"Thanks, Grandma."
Sheldon,"You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice."
Sheldon,"Oh, it is. Although."
Sheldon,I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
Sheldon,"Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray."
Sheldon,"Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune."
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox."
Sheldon,But what if I’m wrong?
Sheldon,You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
Sheldon,"Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?"
Sheldon,Interesting.
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll try."
Sheldon,A quarter.
Sheldon,"On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?"
Sheldon,But I haven’t decided yet.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter."
Sheldon,Meh.
Sheldon,"Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?"
Sheldon,Why would I be jealous?
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television."
Sheldon,Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
Sheldon,Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
Sheldon,Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
Sheldon,I couldn’t sleep.
Sheldon,"No, that’s not it."
Sheldon,"Yes, but you wouldn’t understand."
Sheldon,"All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool."
Sheldon,You mean your acting career?
Sheldon,Your relationship with Leonard?
Sheldon,Your failed attempt to go back to college?
Sheldon,"I said Leonard, you said no."
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, what do you do?"
Sheldon,I don’t know if I can do that.
Sheldon,"Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"
Sheldon,"I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
Sheldon,"Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface."
Sheldon,"It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
Sheldon,"I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too."
Sheldon,The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
Sheldon,You stop it.
Sheldon,"Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS."
Sheldon,"Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter."
Sheldon,Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
Sheldon,Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
Sheldon,"I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one."
Sheldon,She’s right. I’m too hot.
Sheldon,"Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?"
Sheldon,"Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science."
Sheldon,Have you considered studying standard model physics?
Sheldon,"You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?"
Sheldon,"Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp."
Sheldon,"Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy."
Sheldon,"That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day."
Sheldon,A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
Sheldon,"Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?"
Sheldon,No more than Penny.
Sheldon,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out."
Sheldon,"Oh, no. What have I done?"
Sheldon,Not so good.
Sheldon,It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?"
Sheldon,"Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no."
Sheldon,"Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night."
Sheldon,Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
Sheldon,I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?"
Sheldon,"Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass."
Sheldon,Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I could use your assistance."
Sheldon,"Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?"
Sheldon,That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…
Sheldon,It is just so frustrating.
Sheldon,All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Sheldon,I don’t know. What do you want to do?
Sheldon,"Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?"
Sheldon,"Oh, got it. We order a pizza."
Sheldon,"You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings."
Sheldon,Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Amy’s sick.
Sheldon,"Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands."
Sheldon,"Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
Sheldon,Oh. Who knows?
Sheldon,"So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?"
Sheldon,"Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday."
Sheldon,Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.
Sheldon,And Amy doesn’t look sick.
Sheldon,That’s a good question.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
Sheldon,"And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
Sheldon,Where are we going?
Sheldon,"Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…"
Sheldon,I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
Sheldon,My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
Sheldon,Not at all.
Sheldon,"But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah."
Sheldon,I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
Sheldon,"Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch."
Sheldon,"This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here."
Sheldon,"No, it’s not."
Sheldon,"Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter."
Sheldon,Have you ever paid for a meal?
Sheldon,Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
Sheldon,"You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram."
Sheldon,Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
Sheldon,"I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence."
Sheldon,"Okay, I just did. What was it?"
Sheldon,"For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie."
Sheldon,That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
Sheldon,"The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time."
Sheldon,"Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg."
Sheldon,"You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey."
Sheldon,Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.
Sheldon,"And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans."
Sheldon,Get it?
Sheldon,Come in.
Sheldon,"Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time."
Sheldon,What is it?
Sheldon,Professor Proton is dead?
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t."
Sheldon,"But, that’s Star Wars Day."
Sheldon,I’m fine.
Sheldon,"Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m not going to the funeral."
Sheldon,"All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned."
Sheldon,"Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
Sheldon,"If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight."
Sheldon,"Uh, no, thank you."
Sheldon,I’m fine.
Sheldon,"Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?"
Sheldon,"Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day."
Sheldon,"Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace."
Sheldon,"Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
Sheldon,Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
Sheldon,"Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast."
Sheldon,"Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again."
Sheldon,Arthur. I thought you were dead.
Sheldon,Why are you here?
Sheldon,I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.
Sheldon,"Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form."
Sheldon,You must be here to give me advice.
Sheldon,Those are your Jedi robes.
Sheldon,Be careful with that.
Sheldon,This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
Sheldon,"When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?"
Sheldon,That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
Sheldon,I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos."
Sheldon,"Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14."
Sheldon,"And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away."
Sheldon,But I do appreciate them.
Sheldon,I’m okay. How was the funeral?
Sheldon,I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
Sheldon,"That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap."
Sheldon,Wow. A Death Star cake.
Sheldon,You’re back.
Sheldon,That’s nice.
Sheldon,Why do I need you now?
Sheldon,So?
Sheldon,Not at all.
Sheldon,I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
Sheldon,"I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy."
Sheldon,"Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust."
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,Thanks for coming with me.
Sheldon,I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
Sheldon,"Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?"
Sheldon,"That was awkward, right?"
Sheldon,Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
Sheldon,Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
Sheldon,"Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
Sheldon,"No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?"
Sheldon,Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
Sheldon,"Slick, huh?"
Sheldon,Have you had intercourse?
Sheldon,"Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure."
Sheldon,"An interesting question. Well, good night."
Sheldon,That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
Sheldon,How many women have you had dates with?
Sheldon,How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
Sheldon,Sure.
Sheldon,"Well, now do you see the problem?"
Sheldon,"I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night."
Sheldon,"So, who’s watching her now?"
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
Sheldon,"He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face."
Sheldon,"It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university."
Sheldon,I don’t know. I am really aggravated.
Sheldon,"I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory."
Sheldon,"You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand."
Sheldon,You’re right. I’ll take that out.
Sheldon,Mm.
Sheldon,"Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."
Sheldon,"Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish."
Sheldon,What do you mean?
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
Sheldon,I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?
Sheldon,Where are you going to go?
Sheldon,Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
Sheldon,Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
Sheldon,"Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?"
Sheldon,I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
Sheldon,Wow.
Sheldon,How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
Sheldon,"Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
Sheldon,"I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy."
Sheldon,"Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes."
Sheldon,"Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?"
Sheldon,I don’t know. Perhaps.
Sheldon,"You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?"
Sheldon,"No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder."
Sheldon,No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,What happened?
Sheldon,And you couldn’t put it out?
Sheldon,So when will you reopen?
Sheldon,"So, tomorrow?"
Sheldon,"Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny."
Sheldon,"No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please."
Sheldon,Really? It’s soaking wet.
Sheldon,Can you break a twenty?
Sheldon,"You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster."
Sheldon,You tracked my phone?
Sheldon,"Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
Sheldon,Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
Sheldon,My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.
Sheldon,No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
Sheldon,It doesn’t matter.
Sheldon,I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
Sheldon,Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think."
Sheldon,"Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher."
Sheldon,I do.
Sheldon,I will.
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,Of course you are.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?"
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything."
Sheldon,"No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs."
Sheldon,"2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,"
Sheldon,Hurry.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?"
Sheldon,"Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez."
Sheldon,Any word on my stolen items?
Sheldon,"You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick."
Sheldon,"Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?"
Sheldon,"I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."
Sheldon,"Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle."
Sheldon,"Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station."
Sheldon,Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.
Sheldon,Or had a single piece of fruit.
Sheldon,"At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?"
Sheldon,"Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?"
Sheldon,I just thought you were bad at the game.
Sheldon,"Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
Sheldon,"Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
Sheldon,I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
Sheldon,Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
Sheldon,I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
Sheldon,That I couldn’t do it?
Sheldon,"That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks."
Sheldon,"Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way."
Sheldon,Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.
Sheldon,Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
Sheldon,"Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud."
Sheldon,"Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom."
Sheldon,"I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out."
Sheldon,"I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas."
Sheldon,"Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked."
Sheldon,The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
Sheldon,"I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?"
Sheldon,Swish.
Sheldon,It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
Sheldon, Guess who?
Sheldon," That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?"
Sheldon,Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
Sheldon,"That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
Sheldon,"Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?"
Sheldon,"But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class."
Sheldon,So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
Sheldon,You people are sick.
Sheldon,"Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
Sheldon,What a stupid question.
Sheldon,I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
Sheldon,"Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do."
Sheldon,"A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel."
Sheldon,"It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
Sheldon,There is no class.
Sheldon,No one signed up.
Sheldon,"I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious."
Sheldon,"No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away."
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,"Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
Sheldon,"Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?"
Sheldon,"Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,You take that back.
Sheldon,I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
Sheldon,"Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine."
Sheldon,Not now.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it."
Sheldon,"I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure."
Sheldon,"Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
Sheldon,"Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin."
Sheldon,I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?"
Sheldon,Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?"
Sheldon,"Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C."
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
Sheldon,"Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?"
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!"
Sheldon,Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
Sheldon,Well?
Sheldon,Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
Sheldon,You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
Sheldon,I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
Sheldon,"Yeah, try me."
Sheldon,Young’s modulus.
Sheldon,Laminate the core material.
Sheldon,Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.
Sheldon,"He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck."
Sheldon,"Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team."
Sheldon,Did you enjoy my lecture?
Sheldon,"Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it."
Sheldon,"Good, I had Cornish game hen."
Sheldon,"I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement."
Sheldon,"If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care."
Sheldon,"At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding."
Sheldon,"No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum."
Sheldon,"Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours."
Sheldon,"I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you."
Sheldon,"For starters, we enjoy spending time together."
Sheldon,It’s called parallel play.
Sheldon,Not as well as we do.
Sheldon,"Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over."
Sheldon,"If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today."
Sheldon,May I have one of your fries?
Sheldon,Absolutely not.
Sheldon,It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
Sheldon,"Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four."
Sheldon,"No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig."
Sheldon,"Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto."
Sheldon,"Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper."
Sheldon,"It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
Sheldon,Kind of? It does it perfectly.
Sheldon,"Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge."
Sheldon,"The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."
Sheldon,Or a one. A one is possible.
Sheldon,"We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy."
Sheldon,Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
Sheldon,"I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade."
Sheldon,Who’s the bobblehead of?
Sheldon,"No, as long as it bobbles."
Sheldon,"Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch."
Sheldon,He makes a valid point.
Sheldon,"Oh, I think that sounds wonderful."
Sheldon,"Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
Sheldon,I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop."
Sheldon,I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
Sheldon,"I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?"
Sheldon,"Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies."
Sheldon,"For starters, they shed and bite."
Sheldon,"I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
Sheldon,"So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
Sheldon,"Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?"
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next."
Sheldon,No. You’re crazy about me.
Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store."
Sheldon,"And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out."
Sheldon,"Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up."
Sheldon,I’m sure she did.
Sheldon,"Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list."
Sheldon,If only Penny had said that once in a while.
Sheldon,"Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon."
Sheldon,"I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack."
Sheldon,I’d like your honest opinion on something.
Sheldon,"Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind."
Sheldon,"Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store."
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
Sheldon,"It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace."
Sheldon,"Well, I guess it was too good to be true."
Sheldon,"I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
Sheldon,I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.
Sheldon,"Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?"
Sheldon,"Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
Sheldon,"Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?"
Sheldon,I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
Sheldon,A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
Sheldon,Did you see The Lake House?
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house."
Sheldon,"Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
Sheldon,Thinking caps on.
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. Is that a no?
Sheldon,I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.
Sheldon,Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
Sheldon,"You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact."
Sheldon,"If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application."
Sheldon,I think I have the same one.
Sheldon,"Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?"
Sheldon,Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
Sheldon,That’s my boy.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!"
Sheldon,"Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…"
Sheldon,Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t."
Sheldon,"Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?"
Sheldon,I don’t think it worked.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here."
Sheldon,"Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that."
Sheldon,"Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?"
Sheldon,"Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ll check Amazon."
Sheldon,"Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?"
Sheldon,Ow. We didn’t vote!
Sheldon,You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.
Sheldon,Ow. That was your fault.
Sheldon,I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters."
Sheldon,Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.
Sheldon,But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field."
Sheldon,I started doing it.
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
Sheldon,I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.
Sheldon,"I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies."
Sheldon,Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next."
Sheldon,Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
Sheldon,"So it’s settled, we’re not doing it."
Sheldon,Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,"Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
Sheldon,"Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos."
Sheldon,"Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
Sheldon,"Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked."
Sheldon,"All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?"
Sheldon,"Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list."
Sheldon,"Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know."
Sheldon,"Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees."
Sheldon,"True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves."
Sheldon,Good. Little claustrophobic.
Sheldon,Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
Sheldon,"Just the hits.  Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew."
Sheldon,"Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine."
Sheldon,"Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal."
Sheldon,"Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."
Sheldon,Who’s he?
Sheldon,That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
Sheldon,He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
Sheldon,I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
Sheldon,Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
Sheldon,This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
Sheldon,You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.
Sheldon,We’ll take some Funyuns.
Sheldon,"Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana."
Sheldon,"As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature."
Sheldon,My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
Sheldon,"You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs."
Sheldon,We’re not stopping.
Sheldon,"I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle."
Sheldon,My struggle is emotional.
Sheldon,"It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening."
Sheldon,Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
Sheldon,Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
Sheldon,It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.
Sheldon,"You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost."
Sheldon,His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
Sheldon,"No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know."
Sheldon,That’s humorous.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous."
Sheldon,Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.
Sheldon,"Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
Sheldon,Making the extra effort. Good for you.
Sheldon,"Ooh, Siam Palace?"
Sheldon,"Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?"
Sheldon,"Uh, extra peanut sauce?"
Sheldon,"Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak."
Sheldon,Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
Sheldon,"Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage."
Sheldon,"So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us."
Sheldon,"Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey."
Sheldon,What’d you get? What’d you get?
Sheldon,"Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him."
Sheldon,"Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis."
Sheldon,So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks."
Sheldon,"Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?"
Sheldon,"Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl."
Sheldon,"Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure."
Sheldon,"Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased."
Sheldon,"Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something."
Sheldon,I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
Sheldon,"No, I’d look silly in that helmet."
Sheldon,"Oh, this day just keeps getting better."
Sheldon,You can do this.
Sheldon,You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
Sheldon,All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
Sheldon,"True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon."
Sheldon,"No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…"
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon,"Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank."
Sheldon,"I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it."
Sheldon,"We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy."
Sheldon,"My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up."
Sheldon,There are post-prom mating rituals?
Sheldon,"Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it."
Sheldon,"I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on."
Sheldon,Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
Sheldon,"His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does."
Sheldon,"What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly."
Sheldon,"I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody."
Sheldon,"Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants."
Sheldon,"Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook."
Sheldon,Why would you say that?
Sheldon,Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Sheldon,"I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck."
Sheldon,I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Sheldon,"According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day."
Sheldon,What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
Sheldon,It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
Sheldon,I really did think you looked pretty.
Sheldon,Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
Sheldon,Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
Sheldon,Thank you for understanding.
Sheldon,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
Sheldon,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room."
Sheldon,Me.
Sheldon,Still think it’s me.
Sheldon,"Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me."
Sheldon,"Oh, Tesla."
Sheldon,"Hey, how did it go?"
Sheldon,Why would you have surgery?
Sheldon,But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
Sheldon,"Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine."
Sheldon,Very well. I’m done talking about it.
Sheldon,I believe it was your turn in the game.
Sheldon,"Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
Sheldon,I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
Sheldon,I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.
Sheldon,"Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?"
Sheldon,"If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone."
Sheldon,"I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried."
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."
Sheldon,I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.
Sheldon,"Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."
Sheldon,"Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?"
Sheldon,"Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?"
Sheldon,Fine. What about epilepsy?
Sheldon,"You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland."
Sheldon,"I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life."
Sheldon,You don’t know that.
Sheldon,You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
Sheldon,"I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way."
Sheldon,"Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death."
Sheldon,18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.
Sheldon,"Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."
Sheldon,"Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."
Sheldon,"No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it."
Sheldon,You’re acting odd. Why?
Sheldon,Tell me the truth.
Sheldon,Come on.
Sheldon,Amy. What’s going on?
Sheldon,I see. Take me to Leonard.
Sheldon,"Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway."
Sheldon,I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
Sheldon,That’s for the fire marshal to determine.
Sheldon,Is he okay?
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,"That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?"
Sheldon,"I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
Sheldon,"Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me."
Sheldon,You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
Sheldon,There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
Sheldon,It was like a grapefruit.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
Sheldon,"The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was."
Sheldon,You bet your sweet B I won’t.
Sheldon,And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.
Sheldon,"A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay."
Sheldon,Try and stop me.
Sheldon,Why didn’t you stop me?
Sheldon,You know this is all your fault.
Sheldon,I told you not to get the surgery.
Sheldon,"Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you."
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out."
Sheldon,"I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there."
Sheldon,"Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in."
Sheldon,"I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”"
Sheldon,"Oh, that one’s mine."
Sheldon,"Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?"
Sheldon,"But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend."
Sheldon,"So as they say, all good things must come to an end."
Sheldon,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
Sheldon,"And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?"
Sheldon,It was so good.
Sheldon,"Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder."
Sheldon,Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
Sheldon,How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
Sheldon,"Crikey, what flag do we have today?"
Sheldon,And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
Sheldon,I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
Sheldon,Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
Sheldon,"Fancy a dip, my dear?"
Sheldon,"Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
Sheldon,No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
Sheldon,"Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton."
Sheldon,"You do this, I delete your contact information."
Sheldon,While you watch me do it.
Sheldon,"Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George."
Sheldon,"You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist."
Sheldon,"Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show."
Sheldon,"And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night."
Sheldon,If you didn’t press record…
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing."
Sheldon,It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.
Sheldon,Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
Sheldon,"Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back."
Sheldon,Let’s celebrate.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary."
Sheldon, LeVar Burton?
Sheldon,"You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
Sheldon,"You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk"
Sheldon,"You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk."
Sheldon,"Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire."
Sheldon,"Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going."
Sheldon,Why do you hate me?
Sheldon,"Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I appreciate the ride."
Sheldon,"Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him."
Sheldon,"My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma."
Sheldon,"Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts."
Sheldon,"Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show."
Sheldon,"Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson."
Sheldon,"Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good."
Sheldon,I’m going to buy her a present.
Sheldon,"With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible."
Sheldon,"Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
Sheldon,"That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too."
Sheldon,"No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along."
Sheldon,"I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless."
Sheldon,Correct.
Sheldon,There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
Sheldon,If you like raisins.
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good."
Sheldon,"Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this."
Sheldon,"Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
Sheldon,Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, how about now?  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun."
Sheldon,But what about our agreement?
Sheldon,Cookies?
Sheldon,They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
Sheldon,"I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box."
Sheldon,What colour would you like to be?
Sheldon,"That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow."
Sheldon,"Well, then it’s settled."
Sheldon,"Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories."
Sheldon,You want to be green?
Sheldon,"Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green."
Sheldon,"And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time."
Sheldon,You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do."
Sheldon,"Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog."
Sheldon,You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
Sheldon,"Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?"
Sheldon,"You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?"
Sheldon,"Well, then, it’s settled?"
Sheldon,"Well, once again, it’s what I do."
Sheldon,"That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties."
Sheldon,I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
Sheldon,They have a man there who understands my personal style.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
Sheldon,I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
Sheldon,"No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit."
Sheldon,"Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three."
Sheldon,"Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here."
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises."
Sheldon,"I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise."
Sheldon,All the time.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you."
Sheldon,"Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me."
Sheldon,"Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise."
Sheldon,"Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast."
Sheldon,"I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising."
Sheldon,"Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown."
Sheldon,Is that true?
Sheldon,"Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."
Sheldon,"You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should."
Sheldon,"Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life."
Sheldon,I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
Sheldon,It’s okay.
Sheldon,"I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me."
Sheldon,That’s exactly what I told him.
Sheldon,"Well, what if you did it gradually?"
Sheldon,How about one night and I let you whistle?
Sheldon,When I’m not home.
Sheldon,"There we go, compromising again. We really are the best."
Sheldon,It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.
Sheldon,I saw that.
Sheldon,"Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"
Sheldon,Okay. Go ahead.
Sheldon,"Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it."
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman."
Sheldon,"Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science."
Sheldon,Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.
Sheldon,"How could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
Sheldon,I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
Sheldon,Like a big old baby.
Sheldon,I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon,You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
Sheldon,"Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard."
Sheldon,And to clarify?
Sheldon,I’m not going. Would you like to know why?
Sheldon,"Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself."
Sheldon,"According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose…"
Sheldon,Done.
Sheldon,"You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
Sheldon,And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.
Sheldon,"Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart."
Sheldon,Who eats them horizontally?
Sheldon,Perhaps this was a waste of time.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…"
Sheldon,"Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?"
Sheldon,"Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused."
Sheldon,"Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me."
Sheldon,"Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?"
Sheldon,"I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, then do it."
Sheldon,"You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful."
Sheldon, Ladies?
Sheldon,Ladies.
Sheldon,"Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"
Sheldon,"Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
Sheldon,"And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue."
Sheldon,"You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?"
Sheldon,"Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye."
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her."
Sheldon,"Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
Sheldon,"Oh, you said it."
Sheldon,I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
Sheldon,He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
Sheldon,"That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."
Sheldon,"There you go, perfect."
Sheldon,"But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress."
Sheldon,"Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately."
Sheldon,"Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?"
Sheldon,"Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?"
Sheldon,"And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in."
Sheldon,"I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton."
Sheldon,Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here.
Sheldon,"Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me."
Sheldon,"No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time."
Sheldon,"No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me."
Sheldon,"Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep."
Sheldon,That’s not gonna work.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels."
Sheldon,Of course not.
Sheldon,Hmm.
Sheldon,Hmm.
Sheldon,"Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers."
Sheldon,It’s good.
Sheldon,I like it. I think you’re on to something.
Sheldon,"Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job."
Sheldon,Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll take it back."
Sheldon,"For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump."
Sheldon,"Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper."
Sheldon,I wrote a paper on our idea.
Sheldon,When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
Sheldon,"Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright."
Sheldon,"Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you."
Sheldon,"We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."
Sheldon,My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
Sheldon,Come on. Click the mouse with me.
Sheldon,"Yes, we did, my friend."
Sheldon,I don’t want to talk about it.
Sheldon,Does it smell like blueberries?
Sheldon,Then we’re probably okay.
Sheldon,"Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful."
Sheldon,"I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking."
Sheldon,Read another one.
Sheldon,Who wrote that?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m responding to it."
Sheldon,"Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers."
Sheldon,He just left another comment.
Sheldon,Can I respond now?
Sheldon,"You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be."
Sheldon,"Hmm. No, not yet."
Sheldon,"My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother."
Sheldon,We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
Sheldon,He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?"
Sheldon,"He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating."
Sheldon,And send.
Sheldon,I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.
Sheldon,"I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere."
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world."
Sheldon,Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
Sheldon,He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.
Sheldon,"Click it with me. One, two, three, click."
Sheldon,Professor Hawking?
Sheldon,Then why are you attacking us?
Sheldon,"Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper."
Sheldon,"I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?"
Sheldon,How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Sheldon,Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
Sheldon,"Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs."
Sheldon,"Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
Sheldon,"What do you want, Barry?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken."
Sheldon,Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
Sheldon,"Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?"
Sheldon,"That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along."
Sheldon,"I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?"
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello."
Sheldon,I’m mad at Amy.
Sheldon,No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
Sheldon,"Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that."
Sheldon,Why would she do this to me?
Sheldon,"No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science."
Sheldon,"Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel."
Sheldon,"Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?"
Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re getting creative."
Sheldon,"Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?"
Sheldon,Can I think about the spiny anteater?
Sheldon,The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.
Sheldon,How does that work?
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.
Sheldon,I may have a better way that you can teach me.
Sheldon,What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
Sheldon,Are you sure?
Sheldon,"Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go."
Sheldon,"Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way."
Sheldon,"She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?"
Sheldon,"No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?"
Sheldon,"Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard."
Sheldon,"I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go."
Sheldon,Penny?
Sheldon,I think I left my pen in there.
Sheldon,I can’t. I’m naked.
Sheldon,Hang on.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
Sheldon,"Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."
Sheldon,May I say something?
Sheldon,But I think it would be comforting.
Sheldon,"When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do."
Sheldon,"I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad."
Sheldon,It won’t be as good.
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…"
Sheldon,You didn’t even let me finish.
Sheldon,"So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster."
Sheldon,"In the interest of science, I’d be willing to."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope."
Sheldon,"Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons."
Sheldon,"Okay, babe, let’s do this."
Sheldon,You ready to begin?
Sheldon,Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
Sheldon,"Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…"
Sheldon,Hmm. Living or dead?
Sheldon,"Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself."
Sheldon,"Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert."
Sheldon,What would constitute a perfect day for you?
Sheldon,That’s it?
Sheldon,You didn’t mention Leonard.
Sheldon,"I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing."
Sheldon,"Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
Sheldon,Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
Sheldon,"If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
Sheldon,I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
Sheldon,I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
Sheldon,Ha. Keep dreaming.
Sheldon,When are we going to get robot eyes?
Sheldon,"Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?
Sheldon,"So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut."
Sheldon,The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,You’re making it difficult to love you right now.
Sheldon,That’s it. We’re done with the questions.
Sheldon,"Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,We’re not supposed to talk during this part.
Sheldon,This is kind of creepy.
Sheldon,"Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with."
Sheldon,"Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and you’re still eating our food."
Sheldon,"I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food."
Sheldon,"No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."
Sheldon,"And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make."
Sheldon,"Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?"
Sheldon,Thank you for walking me home.
Sheldon,"Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening."
Sheldon,Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. You’re back."
Sheldon,"As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible."
Sheldon,Do you want to say it?
Sheldon,Sarcasm?
Sheldon,"Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
Sheldon,"No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
Sheldon,"After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise."
Sheldon,"Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord."
Sheldon,That was a lot of puppies.
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?"
Sheldon,"I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house."
Sheldon,Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
Sheldon,"Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian."
Sheldon,Would you have approved?
Sheldon,"Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?"
Sheldon,I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
Sheldon,I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
Sheldon,"Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one."
Sheldon,So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
Sheldon,"Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said."
Sheldon,"First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application."
Sheldon,Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
Sheldon,What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
Sheldon,"Yep, you’re mad."
Sheldon,"I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint."
Sheldon,"Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?"
Sheldon,But I made a video.
Sheldon,"Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out."
Sheldon,Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
Sheldon,"Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
Sheldon,Do you want me to withdraw my application?
Sheldon,"And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work."
Sheldon,Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
Sheldon,"I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?"
Sheldon,"You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?"
Sheldon,"They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?"
Sheldon,"Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face."
Sheldon,"Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
Sheldon,"Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote."
Sheldon,I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
Sheldon,"Well, that can’t be right."
Sheldon,All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
Sheldon,Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
Sheldon,"Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’d be incensed."
Sheldon,Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
Sheldon,Grass is always greener?
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me."
Sheldon,But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
Sheldon,"Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard."
Sheldon,"For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England."
Sheldon,Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
Sheldon,"Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that."
Sheldon,"Oh, right. This is a disaster."
Sheldon,"Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it."
Sheldon,An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
Sheldon,"No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it."
Sheldon,You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
Sheldon,They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
Sheldon,"I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight."
Sheldon,"It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse."
Sheldon,You should know I had nothing to do with that.
Sheldon,"You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits."
Sheldon,"Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable."
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
Sheldon,I did.
Sheldon,He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
Sheldon,"Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it."
Sheldon,Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
Sheldon,"Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are."
Sheldon,All he had was an idea.
Sheldon,"Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out."
Sheldon,"Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side."
Sheldon,Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
Sheldon,Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
Sheldon,Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
Sheldon,"Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name."
Sheldon,"But you got it, right?"
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,"Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…"
Sheldon,I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
Sheldon,"Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned."
Sheldon,"Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please. His mother just died."
Sheldon,"Yeah, so are you."
Sheldon,"Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas."
Sheldon,"Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest."
Sheldon,I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
Sheldon,"She said my name first, that must kill you."
Sheldon,"You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…"
Sheldon,Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
Sheldon,They did.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley."
Sheldon,"Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK."
Sheldon,I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
Sheldon,"And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo."
Sheldon,Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
Sheldon,"I’ll begin. Uh, I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
Sheldon,Will you please play the game? I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
Sheldon,I don’t want to play anymore.
Sheldon,"We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging."
Sheldon,"I suppose it is. In fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, I’d be okay with that."
Sheldon,"Play that funky music, white boy."
Sheldon,What reference?
Sheldon,"So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
Sheldon,And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?
Sheldon,Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
Sheldon,"So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?"
Sheldon,Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
Sheldon,Will our hotel room be ready?
Sheldon,Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
Sheldon,"Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won’t be very far from Skywalker Ranch."
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,"Yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That’s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in."
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it."
Sheldon,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,There it is. It’s just a gate. On a road.
Sheldon,This is so amazing.
Sheldon,I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
Sheldon,Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
Sheldon,"There’s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens."
Sheldon,"Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations."
Sheldon,"You pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
Sheldon,You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
Sheldon,"All right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
Sheldon,"I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?"
Sheldon,Honesty will never get us in.
Sheldon,"All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
Sheldon,"Oh, you are killing me."
Sheldon,What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.
Sheldon,"Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man."
Sheldon,"I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!"
Sheldon,Do you think they’re gonna call the police?
Sheldon,"Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…"
Sheldon,"So, what are you in for?"
Sheldon,But why are you here?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
Sheldon,"Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are."
Sheldon,Are you still mad at me?
Sheldon,"Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
Sheldon,"Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you’re looking at this all wrong."
Sheldon,"Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser."
Sheldon,See?
Sheldon,I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
Sheldon,That’s amazing.
Sheldon,"And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?"
Sheldon,"It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing."
Sheldon,"Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind."
Sheldon,"Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated."
Sheldon,"I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included."
Sheldon,You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
Sheldon,Agreed.
Sheldon,Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
Sheldon,"I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?"
Sheldon,"Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night."
Sheldon,You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
Sheldon,"I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant."
Sheldon,Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
Sheldon,"You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb."
Sheldon,"Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself."
Sheldon,"I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
Sheldon,It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
Sheldon,Isn’t that a little juvenile?
Sheldon,I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
Sheldon,Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
Sheldon,"Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket."
Sheldon,I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
Sheldon,Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
Sheldon,"Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket."
Sheldon,Mm-hmm.
Sheldon,"Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner."
Sheldon,"Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library."
Sheldon,"Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
Sheldon,That’s a big step.
Sheldon,"Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
Sheldon,"G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
Sheldon,Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
Sheldon,"It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?"
Sheldon,We built a fort.
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?"
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in."
Sheldon,"I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here."
Sheldon,Not there. That’s my spot.
Sheldon,"Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?"
Sheldon,"There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…"
Sheldon,"Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
Sheldon,Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien."
Sheldon,Excellent.
Sheldon,"I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm."
Sheldon,Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
Sheldon,"I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
Sheldon,"I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali."
Sheldon,"How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list."
Sheldon,"Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
Sheldon,"Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you."
Sheldon,"I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people."
Sheldon,"No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start."
Sheldon,"So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
Sheldon,Mmm.
Sheldon,Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
Sheldon,"All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
Sheldon,"Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
Sheldon,"No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man."
Sheldon,"Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?"
Sheldon,"Ah, it’s just like he’s here."
Sheldon,"You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar."
Sheldon,I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
Sheldon,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?"
Sheldon,Certainly.
Sheldon,"Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj."
Sheldon,Tonight works better for me.
Sheldon,"Uh, building on that, we should order dinner."
Sheldon,"Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado."
Sheldon,"Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out."
Sheldon,"You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
Sheldon,"Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard."
Sheldon,We looked great.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing."
Sheldon,"Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience."
Sheldon,"I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
Sheldon,"No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?"
Sheldon,"If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed."
Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
Sheldon,"At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
Sheldon,Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
Sheldon,And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
Sheldon,All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,It actually says at least?
Sheldon,Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
Sheldon,You see where I’m going with this.
Sheldon,"All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter."
Sheldon,"Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?"
Sheldon,"Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter."
Sheldon,Yay.
Sheldon,"We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Sheldon,Won’t that void the warranty?
Sheldon,"You know what they all do, right?"
Sheldon,What about this one?
Sheldon,Not very.
Sheldon,"So, can you get it working?"
Sheldon,I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon."
Sheldon,You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
Sheldon,I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
Sheldon,"Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore."
Sheldon,"Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados."
Sheldon,Wrong. Obesity.
Sheldon,"Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
Sheldon,Whoa.
Sheldon,You call tech support.
Sheldon,Check.
Sheldon,Check.
Sheldon,That’s what my train used to do.
Sheldon,"It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise."
Sheldon,Then who is?
Sheldon,"Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me."
Sheldon,"Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police."
Sheldon,"Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe."
Sheldon,"Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?"
Sheldon,You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
Sheldon,"Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?"
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you, Mother."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
Sheldon,"What did they feed the lions, Mother?"
Sheldon,"Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?"
Sheldon,"Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say."
Sheldon,"Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Sheldon,"Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary."
Sheldon,"Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?"
Sheldon,"Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius."
Sheldon,"Ooh, this is a good one."
Sheldon,Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
Sheldon,But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
Sheldon,I was a handful.
Sheldon,"Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
Sheldon,"Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."
Sheldon,"Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."
Sheldon,You remember my mother.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure."
Sheldon,"You mean the box, right?"
Sheldon,Did I misspeak about the ring?
Sheldon,Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
Sheldon,"Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler."
Sheldon,"Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you."
Sheldon,It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell."
Sheldon,"Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat."
Sheldon,"I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are."
Sheldon,While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
Sheldon,"Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?"
Sheldon,I taught her that.
Sheldon,I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
Sheldon,"Well, one of the things."
Sheldon,"Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway."
Sheldon,"You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
Sheldon,"Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try."
Sheldon,Whenever you’re ready.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance."
Sheldon,What happened?
Sheldon,Been there.
Sheldon,"Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series."
Sheldon,"Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face."
Sheldon,It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
Sheldon,"Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
Sheldon,"If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
Sheldon,"No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now."
Sheldon,Too slow?
Sheldon,That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date."
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,Okay. If you say so.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Yeah, shut up, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Things are good right now.
Sheldon,Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
Sheldon,Seriously? Airborne worms?
Sheldon,You still didn’t pick a date.
Sheldon,I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
Sheldon,"Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?"
Sheldon,"Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?"
Sheldon,"So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
Sheldon,"My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
Sheldon,After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
Sheldon,Now get out of my spot.
Sheldon,"Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…"
Sheldon,Strongly disagree. Go on.
Sheldon,Oh.
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,"Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
Sheldon,Good. Don’t do it.
Sheldon,"Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
Sheldon,Amy has ended our relationship.
Sheldon,Is Penny crying?
Sheldon,"No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering."
Sheldon,"Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things."
Sheldon,Whatever.
Sheldon,Why did I just hear Amy’s name?
Sheldon,"Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care."
Sheldon,Amy’s upset? Is it about me?
Sheldon,"Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"When last we spoke, you said you needed time."
Sheldon,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity."
Sheldon,Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
Sheldon,"Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again."
Sheldon,"Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"
Sheldon,And who’s this guy you’re taking?
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad."
Sheldon,"Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?"
Sheldon,We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.
Sheldon,I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.
Sheldon,I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
Sheldon,"Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another."
Sheldon,"Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
Sheldon,You hear that? Raj is devastated.
Sheldon,"I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard."
Sheldon,"Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj."
Sheldon,"Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind."
Sheldon,"Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date."
Sheldon,Will someone take me home?
Sheldon,I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
Sheldon,She broke up with me.
Sheldon,"No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you."
Sheldon,It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
Sheldon,Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?
Sheldon,"Then no, thank you."
Sheldon,Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
Sheldon,"Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you."
Sheldon,"Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage."
Sheldon,"Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that."
Sheldon,He does? Who is it?
Sheldon,Mandy Chao?
Sheldon,"Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better"
Sheldon,"Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson."
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
Sheldon,Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
Sheldon,Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
Sheldon,"I see. Well, I think I’ll be going."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
Sheldon,"Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed."
Sheldon,Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
Sheldon,You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
Sheldon,And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie."
Sheldon,You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
Sheldon,Really? I never imagined it any other way.
Sheldon,Why are you up?
Sheldon,"Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."
Sheldon,"Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems."
Sheldon,"Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
Sheldon,I’m currently single.
Sheldon,I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
Sheldon,"Well, hello to you, too."
Sheldon,"I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together."
Sheldon,A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
Sheldon,Great. See you in about half an hour.
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,"Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them."
Sheldon,"You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher."
Sheldon,"Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again."
Sheldon,I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
Sheldon,"On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits."
Sheldon,Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
Sheldon,You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
Sheldon,"We made one heck of a team, huh?"
Sheldon,"It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us."
Sheldon,"Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough."
Sheldon," Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours."
Sheldon,Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
Sheldon,"Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution."
Sheldon,Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
Sheldon,"Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
Sheldon,And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
Sheldon,Yes. And that’s coming from me.
Sheldon,"In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely."
Sheldon,"Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible."
Sheldon,"But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?"
Sheldon,"I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do."
Sheldon,Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
Sheldon,"Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun."
Sheldon,Is there a problem?
Sheldon,"You saw through that one, did you?"
Sheldon,She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
Sheldon,She was listening through the door. She wants me.
Sheldon,Would you pass the mustard?
Sheldon,Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
Sheldon,"Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?"
Sheldon,You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
Sheldon,"Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?"
Sheldon,Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
Sheldon,It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
Sheldon,It runs on syphilis?
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and talked about physics with them."
Sheldon,"Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico."
Sheldon,"Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside."
Sheldon,Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
Sheldon,"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes."
Sheldon,"How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos."
Sheldon,Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
Sheldon,You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
Sheldon,It is extraordinary.
Sheldon,"I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
Sheldon,What was that?
Sheldon,What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,I am getting too old for this crud.
Sheldon,"If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down."
Sheldon,"Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
Sheldon,"Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work."
Sheldon,"Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
Sheldon,"Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper."
Sheldon,"Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up."
Sheldon,What if that burning food attracts animals?
Sheldon,We do?
Sheldon,That’s not very nice.
Sheldon,What is that awful smell?
Sheldon,What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.
Sheldon,"All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite."
Sheldon,We blew up Feynman’s van.
Sheldon,"What a wonderful day, thank you."
Sheldon,"Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It’s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven."
Sheldon,"Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?"
Sheldon,What’s wrong with your closet?
Sheldon,So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
Sheldon,"No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes."
Sheldon,"You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them."
Sheldon,Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
Sheldon,"As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
Sheldon,"I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting."
Sheldon,"Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard’s moving in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned."
Sheldon,Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
Sheldon,"Gandalf, but he’s a smoker."
Sheldon,"Just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I’d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion."
Sheldon,"No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates."
Sheldon,Let me help you. L. E. O. N.
Sheldon,I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.
Sheldon,It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
Sheldon,Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
Sheldon,"In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
Sheldon,"I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
Sheldon,"You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner."
Sheldon,"But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back."
Sheldon,"I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?"
Sheldon,"They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."
Sheldon,"Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy."
Sheldon,"Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard."
Sheldon,"No, just because I’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
Sheldon,"Hello, 2003."
Sheldon,"In my present, it’s in the future. In your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot."
Sheldon,"No, what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me."
Sheldon,"As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand."
Sheldon,They are in 2003.
Sheldon,"How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too."
Sheldon,"No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me."
Sheldon,But mostly here.
Sheldon,"You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we’re all sleeping here."
Sheldon,"All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we’re good."
Sheldon,Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
Sheldon,"According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now."
Sheldon,"Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Had me at flag, lost me at football."
Sheldon,Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
Sheldon,"No throwing, no catching, no running."
Sheldon,"Or worse, up."
Sheldon,"And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."
Sheldon,"Ah, touché."
Sheldon,"Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have."
Sheldon,We’re not afraid of physical activity.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive."
Sheldon,Right. Always right.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Barry?"
Sheldon,When can I stab one of my friends?
Sheldon,"Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources."
Sheldon,"En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."
Sheldon,I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
Sheldon,"You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
Sheldon,My last physical.
Sheldon,"Ah, this is fun."
Sheldon,"Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me."
Sheldon,Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
Sheldon,"Well, that’s unacceptable."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb."
Sheldon,You really think so?
Sheldon,How dare you.
Sheldon,"Barry, a word?"
Sheldon,"If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it."
Sheldon,By challenging you to a duel.
Sheldon,"That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over."
Sheldon,"Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems."
Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
Sheldon,"True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia."
Sheldon,"There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend."
Sheldon,You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you."
Sheldon,It’s a Pokémon reference.
Sheldon,"Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?"
Sheldon,"Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey."
Sheldon,I smell funny. I taste salty.
Sheldon,And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,You don’t have to leave.
Sheldon,I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
Sheldon,It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
Sheldon,"Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man."
Sheldon,"Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no."
Sheldon,I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
Sheldon,Thanks. And I taste good too.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’ve got terrible news."
Sheldon,"Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical."
Sheldon,A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
Sheldon,That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
Sheldon,Perform the experiment immediately.
Sheldon,A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
Sheldon,Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.
Sheldon,Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
Sheldon,But you won’t need much for that.
Sheldon,Not a chance.
Sheldon,"He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?"
Sheldon,He could’ve softened the blow.
Sheldon,"Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."
Sheldon,Where does he work?
Sheldon,How many questions are too many questions?
Sheldon,Four questions. There answer’s four.
Sheldon,What’s he say?
Sheldon,"Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?"
Sheldon,That’s right. And what did he do?
Sheldon,It’s like it was yesterday.
Sheldon,Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical."
Sheldon,Was she helping him with his research?
Sheldon,"Well, but where does he get the helium?"
Sheldon,"Uh, but this is violating university code."
Sheldon,"Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in."
Sheldon,I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
Sheldon,Aren’t you just made of sugar.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van."
Sheldon,I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
Sheldon,"Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?"
Sheldon,Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
Sheldon,Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
Sheldon,"Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage."
Sheldon,"Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?"
Sheldon,"Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination."
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
Sheldon,"Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities."
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it."
Sheldon,Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?
Sheldon,I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
Sheldon,Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
Sheldon,"And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody."
Sheldon,"Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?"
Sheldon,"Right this way, Uncle Harvey."
Sheldon,I’m trying not to attract attention.
Sheldon,She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
Sheldon,"Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
Sheldon,"Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?"
Sheldon,Uh-oh.
Sheldon,"Well, did you see this sticker?"
Sheldon,"It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime."
Sheldon,"That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail."
Sheldon,"Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way."
Sheldon,"He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison."
Sheldon,You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
Sheldon,I don’t understand.
Sheldon,"Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me."
Sheldon,"Finally, something breaks our way."
Sheldon,"Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison."
Sheldon,"It scared me straight, Leonard."
Sheldon,That’s preposterous.
Sheldon,I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
Sheldon,How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
Sheldon,"Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
Sheldon,Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
Sheldon,Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
Sheldon,"Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it."
Sheldon,"Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?"
Sheldon,"This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum."
Sheldon,All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
Sheldon,"Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech."
Sheldon,"The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine."
Sheldon,"I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television."
Sheldon,I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.
Sheldon,Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
Sheldon,When there was no more room in the floor safe.
Sheldon,When we got the security camera.
Sheldon,"Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
Sheldon,Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.
Sheldon,Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.
Sheldon,"No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
Sheldon,Wouldn’t you like to know?
Sheldon,"All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will."
Sheldon,"Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil."
Sheldon,Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
Sheldon,"No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it."
Sheldon,"No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana."
Sheldon,No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
Sheldon,"No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best."
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe."
Sheldon,"Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click."
Sheldon,"Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering."
Sheldon,Excuse me?
Sheldon,No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
Sheldon,"Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time."
Sheldon,"Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
Sheldon,Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
Sheldon,"Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau."
Sheldon,"Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action."
Sheldon,"I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran."
Sheldon,"Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"
Sheldon,Those are very wise words.
Sheldon,They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
Sheldon,"Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion."
Sheldon,"I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
Sheldon,"No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again."
Sheldon,On oatmeal day?
Sheldon,"Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like."
Sheldon,"Thank you for coming by, gentlemen."
Sheldon,"Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."
Sheldon,Gentlemen.
Sheldon,"All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight."
Sheldon,"All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop."
Sheldon,"Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes."
Sheldon,"Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil."
Sheldon,"People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?"
Sheldon,And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
Sheldon,"Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates."
Sheldon,That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
Sheldon,"Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."
Sheldon,"And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules."
Sheldon,"Golly, she sounds too good to be true."
Sheldon,Someone will show.
Sheldon,Someone will show.
Sheldon,"Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that."
Sheldon,One minute is a long time.
Sheldon,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes."
Sheldon,Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
Sheldon,"Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea."
Sheldon,"Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence."
Sheldon,"Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence."
Sheldon,All right. Can I help you?
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Careful, it’s addictive."
Sheldon,"And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie."
Sheldon,"I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing."
Sheldon,"She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals."
Sheldon,"Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?"
Sheldon,"Well, Howard, what about you?"
Sheldon,"Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
Sheldon,"No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like."
Sheldon,And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
Sheldon,You don’t think that will be awkward?
Sheldon,"Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning."
Sheldon,"Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
Sheldon,And there goes my list.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."
Sheldon,"If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"
Sheldon,"No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"
Sheldon,Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
Sheldon,Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
Sheldon,"and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78."
Sheldon,"I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
Sheldon,"All right. Well, what should we talk about?"
Sheldon,Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
Sheldon,I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,Just a few.
Sheldon,How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.
Sheldon,Is that regular or honey nut?
Sheldon,You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
Sheldon,I am.
Sheldon,I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
Sheldon,"You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad."
Sheldon,They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.
Sheldon,Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
Sheldon,"It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle."
Sheldon,What is that?
Sheldon,"Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
Sheldon,"I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp."
Sheldon,Very well done.
Sheldon,"Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?"
Sheldon,"Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish."
Sheldon,"I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down."
Sheldon,"How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?"
Sheldon,"Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello."
Sheldon,Did you have a nice time?
Sheldon,"Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."
Sheldon,Oh. I thought we were just friends.
Sheldon,"Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend."
Sheldon,"Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob."
Sheldon,"Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is."
Sheldon,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise."
Sheldon,"Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?"
Sheldon,"I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it.  My country, ’tis of thee. No."
Sheldon,Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me."
Sheldon,"I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity."
Sheldon,There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.
Sheldon,I’ll show you.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
Sheldon,"This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway."
Sheldon,"Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much."
Sheldon,This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.
Sheldon,"Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, he’s drinking it."
Sheldon,"Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
Sheldon,"Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."
Sheldon,Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
Sheldon,"The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride."
Sheldon,I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
Sheldon,They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
Sheldon,Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
Sheldon,It’s about Amy.
Sheldon,"It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”"
Sheldon,Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
Sheldon, Amy?
Sheldon,"I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
Sheldon,"I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date."
Sheldon,"Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend."
Sheldon,Good. Because I love you.
Sheldon,"Well, I’ll let you get back to your date."
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.
Sheldon,"All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist."
Sheldon,And I will continue to do so!
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Sheldon,"Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee."
Sheldon,"And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed."
Sheldon,"But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?"
Sheldon,"Arthur, what brings you back?"
Sheldon,"In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma."
Sheldon,"Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie."
Sheldon,"Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy."
Sheldon,"So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?"
Sheldon,Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
Sheldon,By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
Sheldon,You’re right.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Sheldon,I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.
Sheldon,"See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you."
Sheldon,"I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night."
Sheldon,It’s late. Got to go. Bye.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon, Bernadette.
Sheldon,Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
Sheldon,"For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix."
Sheldon,"Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift."
Sheldon,"Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic."
Sheldon,"Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different."
Sheldon,"Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep."
Sheldon,That I have coitus with her.
Sheldon,"Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left."
Sheldon,"Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time."
Sheldon,Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
Sheldon,You’re back.
Sheldon,"I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before."
Sheldon,"So, can you help me?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics."
Sheldon,I think they say junk.
Sheldon,"This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at."
Sheldon, Birthday girl.
Sheldon,Oh.
Sheldon,"Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while."
Sheldon,"Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music."
Sheldon,It’s kind of spooky.
Sheldon,"No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine."
Sheldon,"I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon."
Sheldon,Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
Sheldon,Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
Sheldon,Why are we saying give it to you like that?
Sheldon,"I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent."
Sheldon,"You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,All right. Hello.
Sheldon,Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,Neither do I. But we can find out together.
Sheldon,"Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would."
Sheldon,I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
Sheldon,"Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice."
Sheldon,"Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie."
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do."
Sheldon,I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?
Sheldon,"I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy."
Sheldon,"Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle."
Sheldon,All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
Sheldon,At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
Sheldon,"Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say."
Sheldon,"Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?"
Sheldon,That sounds awful. Raj?
Sheldon,That’s the one to beat. Leonard?
Sheldon,"Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations."
Sheldon,"Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won."
Sheldon,"A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes."
Sheldon,Sexual insecurity.
Sheldon,Kind of a wuss.
Sheldon,Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Hmm. What are you doing now?
Sheldon,"Oh, I see. How about now?"
Sheldon,"Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle."
Sheldon,"Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
Sheldon,Found one.
Sheldon,"But, look, an optical transient."
Sheldon,"It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?"
Sheldon,"Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light."
Sheldon,"Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation."
Sheldon,Maybe it’s a new planet.
Sheldon,"Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy."
Sheldon,"Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist."
Sheldon,That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
Sheldon,"Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor."
Sheldon,I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
Sheldon,It is kind of cute.
Sheldon,We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.
Sheldon,That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.
Sheldon,Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
Sheldon,"Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."
Sheldon,Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
Sheldon,"Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it."
Sheldon,"Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid."
Sheldon,I haven’t settled on anything yet.
Sheldon,"All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there."
Sheldon,"It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever."
Sheldon,"I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily."
Sheldon,Exactly. See how well we work together?
Sheldon,Good news. You’re an asteroid.
Sheldon,"Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you."
Sheldon,"Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh."
Sheldon,Even the girls.
Sheldon,I miss you as well.
Sheldon,"Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better."
Sheldon,"My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall."
Sheldon,I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
Sheldon,"Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."
Sheldon,No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
Sheldon,"Penny, rub Vicks on my chest."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me."
Sheldon,"I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke."
Sheldon,She’s a dermatologist.
Sheldon,"Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m dying."
Sheldon,I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.
Sheldon,"I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?"
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason."
Sheldon,"You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?"
Sheldon,"I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"
Sheldon,You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
Sheldon,"You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television."
Sheldon,"Oh, where are we going?"
Sheldon,"Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you."
Sheldon,"Well, now, well, that’s hurtful."
Sheldon,I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
Sheldon,"Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"Well, then Raj and I will…"
Sheldon,Very well. Stuart.
Sheldon,Ugh. Stuart.
Sheldon,"Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them."
Sheldon,Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?
Sheldon,"You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship."
Sheldon,I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
Sheldon,I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
Sheldon,"Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
Sheldon,"I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him."
Sheldon,"Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat."
Sheldon,Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
Sheldon,"Hey, we’re both great at this."
Sheldon,"Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it."
Sheldon,"Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry."
Sheldon,I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
Sheldon,"Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?"
Sheldon,"What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong."
Sheldon,"Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?"
Sheldon,Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
Sheldon,"My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?"
Sheldon,"Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute."
Sheldon,"All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts."
Sheldon,"All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior."
Sheldon,I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
Sheldon,Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
Sheldon,"You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry."
Sheldon,"And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas."
Sheldon,The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
Sheldon,"That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?"
Sheldon,"Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology."
Sheldon,"And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that."
Sheldon,"Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…"
Sheldon,"I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium."
Sheldon,"Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…"
Sheldon,"I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more."
Sheldon,"No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking."
Sheldon,All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…
Sheldon,"Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club."
Sheldon,"That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again."
Sheldon,"Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
Sheldon,"Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth."
Sheldon,Aha.
Sheldon,"My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."
Sheldon,"Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily."
Sheldon,"Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali."
Sheldon,"So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry."
Sheldon,Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart."
Sheldon,"Stuart, now."
Sheldon,"That’s me. Bye, Stuart."
Sheldon,Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
Sheldon,"Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI."
Sheldon,"Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this."
Sheldon,"Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder."
Sheldon,"Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth."
Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!"
Sheldon,"Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel."
Sheldon,That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.
Sheldon,"And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle."
Sheldon,"Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart."
Sheldon,Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.
Sheldon,"Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw."
Sheldon,"No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four."
Sheldon,"It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard."
Sheldon,Are you comfortable?
Sheldon,"You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw."
Sheldon,"Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her."
Sheldon,Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.
Sheldon,"Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready."
Sheldon,"If I did, would I find any?"
Sheldon,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
Sheldon,"A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw."
Sheldon,"Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this."
Sheldon,"Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
Sheldon,"And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her."
Sheldon,"How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask."
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,"Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s."
Sheldon,"But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up."
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t think I could do that."
Sheldon,"I’m gonna opt out of that one, too."
Sheldon,"All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?"
Sheldon,Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?"
Sheldon,"No, I wouldn’t."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you."
Sheldon,"Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress."
Sheldon,Well…
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets."
Sheldon,Gentlemen.
Sheldon,"If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."
Sheldon,Not a clue. Raj?
Sheldon,"You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere."
Sheldon,I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
Sheldon,"Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight."
Sheldon,"Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title."
Sheldon,"So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags."
Sheldon,"Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…"
Sheldon,"It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else."
Sheldon,"Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend."
Sheldon,"You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller."
Sheldon,"Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you."
Sheldon,"I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba."
Sheldon,"Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related."
Sheldon,I don’t see why not.
Sheldon,"Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree."
Sheldon,"And actually, it was three different men."
Sheldon,"Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
Sheldon,"All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with."
Sheldon,"Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us."
Sheldon,"Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it."
Sheldon,Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
Sheldon,"When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…"
Sheldon,I stand corrected. Fun.
Sheldon,Congratulations on a successful live show.
Sheldon,Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
Sheldon,"I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go."
Sheldon,"Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?"
Sheldon,"Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Sheldon,"Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?"
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?"
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
Sheldon,I guess we’ll call this a draw.
Sheldon,Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.
Sheldon,"Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink."
Sheldon,All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
Sheldon,And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
Sheldon,Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
Sheldon,Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.
Sheldon,This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
Sheldon,That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?"
Sheldon,"You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it."
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, I found something."
Sheldon,"This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
Sheldon,"All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible."
Sheldon,And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
Sheldon,"Nah, she’s a good kid."
Sheldon,Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
Sheldon,"Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it."
Sheldon,"A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am."
Sheldon,You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
Sheldon,Will you guys keep it down?
Sheldon,What is it?
Sheldon,"Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have."
Sheldon,Surprise.
Sheldon,"Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you."
Sheldon,"Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink."
Sheldon,"Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me."
Sheldon,"Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends."
Sheldon,"When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window."
Sheldon,"I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?"
Sheldon,"Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time."
Sheldon,"Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
Sheldon,I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
Sheldon,"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me."
Sheldon,Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
Sheldon,But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Sheldon,But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
Sheldon,I am. Oh. Wait.
Sheldon,"No, I just, I got a little light-headed."
Sheldon,"No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this."
Sheldon,"Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason."
Sheldon,Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
Sheldon,How do you know I’m not using the facilities?
Sheldon,"I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
Sheldon,I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.
Sheldon,I don’t think I can go back out there.
Sheldon,"Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it."
Sheldon,"Well, everyone will think I’m weird."
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
Sheldon,"Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me."
Sheldon,"Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go."
Sheldon,"That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not."
Sheldon,And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Thank you. That, that was wonderful."
Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
Sheldon,Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry."
Sheldon,"You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating."
Sheldon,I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn."
Sheldon,That’s great.
Sheldon,Get a load of this guy.
Sheldon,That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
Sheldon,I know when I’m beat.
Sheldon,"Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques."
Sheldon,Couple of questions about the plaque.
Sheldon,"Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."
Sheldon,"To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs."
Sheldon,I’m fine with that.
Sheldon,"It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
Sheldon,But which one of us should be the party who…
Sheldon,So stipulated.
Sheldon,"I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica."
Sheldon,You bet I did.
Sheldon,Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.
Sheldon,"Hey, Leonard."
Sheldon,"If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd."
Sheldon,"Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker."
Sheldon,I wonder what they’re talking about.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
Sheldon,"Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
Sheldon,"No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that."
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
Sheldon,"Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot."
Sheldon,"I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time."
Sheldon,"The, the revisions I made start on page four."
Sheldon,Do you still like cilantro?
Sheldon,You’re tying my hands here.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions."
Sheldon,And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
Sheldon,What? I didn’t sign it yet.
Sheldon,"Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up."
Sheldon,"Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working."
Sheldon,"So, is that a yes?"
Sheldon,"Oh, but I like this computer."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I didn’t get that."
Sheldon,The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.
Sheldon,What?
Sheldon,What?  Hello?
Sheldon,You’re too late.
Sheldon,You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
Sheldon,Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
Sheldon,How could you do that?
Sheldon,"Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?"
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?"
Sheldon,Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
Sheldon,"Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
Sheldon,"I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?"
Sheldon,You wouldn’t.
Sheldon,"Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast."
Sheldon,"Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs."
Sheldon,But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
Sheldon,Oh. I am.
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you."
Sheldon,"Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit."
Sheldon,Can we please change the subject?
Sheldon,"I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain."
Sheldon,It might be easier to show you.
Sheldon,We’d have to take your car.
Sheldon,And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Sheldon,"Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis."
Sheldon,Right.
Sheldon,"No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know."
Sheldon,Just wait.
Sheldon,Just wait.
Sheldon,"Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame."
Sheldon,"It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it."
Sheldon,I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
Sheldon,"In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment."
Sheldon,"Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent."
Sheldon,"I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head."
Sheldon,"I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…"
Sheldon,It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.
Sheldon,"Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me."
Sheldon,"Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?"
Sheldon,Like what?
Sheldon,I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
Sheldon,Only you.
Sheldon,What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
Sheldon,Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.
Sheldon,I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
Sheldon,I will always have the dent to remember it by.
Sheldon,"Actually, yes. I do."
Sheldon,Thanks.
Sheldon,I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.
Sheldon,"Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime."
Sheldon,"You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable."
Sheldon,"Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room."
Sheldon,But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,"It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!"
Sheldon,"I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face."
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest."
Sheldon,"Well, how would I know?"
Sheldon,Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
Sheldon,"Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."
Sheldon,You may need this more than I do.
Sheldon,Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
Sheldon,"Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me."
Sheldon,"I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars."
Sheldon,Are you trying to manipulate me?
Sheldon,"Well done, it worked, we’re going."
Sheldon,I’m ready to go.
Sheldon,Thanks.
Sheldon,"Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time."
Sheldon,Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?"
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?"
Sheldon,"Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm."
Sheldon,"Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on."
Sheldon,"Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out."
Sheldon,That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
Sheldon,"Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game."
Sheldon,"Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?"
Sheldon,So I drink.
Sheldon,Got it.
Sheldon,I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked."
Sheldon,"No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
Sheldon,"No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer."
Sheldon,"Oh, and how."
Sheldon,Amy.
Sheldon,"All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won."
Sheldon,I’m calling it. I won.
Sheldon,"Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean."
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee."
Sheldon,Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
Sheldon,"I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?"
Sheldon,"Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I haven’t asked it yet."
Sheldon,"What, why did you get a party sub?"
Sheldon,"Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party."
Sheldon,"I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting."
Sheldon,"Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance."
Sheldon,You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
Sheldon,"And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"Well, we’ll just see about that."
Sheldon,He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
Sheldon,"Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to."
Sheldon,"Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel."
Sheldon,"There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing."
Sheldon,"Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day."
Sheldon,"You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard."
Sheldon,Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
Sheldon,"Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster."
Sheldon,All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting."
Sheldon,"Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting."
Sheldon,"Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting."
Sheldon,"Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more."
Sheldon,"Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like."
Sheldon,I love Lisa Simpson.
Sheldon,Wait. You were pretending?
Sheldon,No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.
Sheldon,"Hmm, what do you think?"
Sheldon,Gladly.
Sheldon,"It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann."
Sheldon,She did.
Sheldon,"Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard."
Sheldon,"Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death."
Sheldon,I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.
Sheldon,Now it’s a fun fact.
Sheldon,Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
Sheldon,Fair enough.
Sheldon,"Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right."
Sheldon,"They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety."
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,I never got to ask my question about Batman.
Sheldon,"If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?"
Sheldon,I’ll be back.
Sheldon,"Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."
Sheldon,"I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember."
Sheldon,"Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box."
Sheldon,I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
Sheldon,"Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me."
Sheldon,"Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to."
Sheldon,"Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly."
Sheldon,"Oh, but I won’t be there."
Sheldon,"You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia."
Sheldon,"You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?"
Sheldon,I am going to record this for posterity.
Sheldon,Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
Sheldon,"Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post."
Sheldon,Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
Sheldon,"Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby."
Sheldon,"Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
Sheldon,"Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury."
Sheldon,"Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
Sheldon,"Boy, do I love restrictions."
Sheldon,"Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it."
Sheldon,"Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."
Sheldon,You’ve heard of French toast?
Sheldon,Cinnamon toast?
Sheldon,Melba toast?
Sheldon,You get where I’m going here?
Sheldon,"H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220."
Sheldon,"When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."
Sheldon,"What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t."
Sheldon,"Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
Sheldon,"And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons."
Sheldon,You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
Sheldon,"Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
Sheldon,Ready?
Sheldon,"Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall."
Sheldon,"I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs."
Sheldon,"You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm."
Sheldon,What do you do?
Sheldon,He wants to see I.D.
Sheldon,The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
Sheldon,Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.
Sheldon,"Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah."
Sheldon,"Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end."
Sheldon,"Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
Sheldon,"I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius."
Sheldon,"You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting."
Sheldon,"Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot."
Sheldon,Morning.
Sheldon,"Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog."
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,"No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective."
Sheldon,"Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Taylor Swift.
Sheldon,Yes. Kardashian.
Sheldon,Khloe?
Sheldon,"See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?"
Sheldon,Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
Sheldon,She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
Sheldon,"All right, back to learning."
Sheldon,"Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy."
Sheldon,Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
Sheldon,"Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers."
Sheldon,"Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go."
Sheldon,You’re really going without me?
Sheldon,"You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting."
Sheldon,"You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
Sheldon,Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
Sheldon,"Stuart, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?"
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play."
Sheldon,Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
Sheldon,Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
Sheldon,"Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick."
Sheldon,"I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot."
Sheldon,You would do that?
Sheldon,You’re a good man.
Sheldon, Amy.
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh."
Sheldon,"Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth."
Sheldon,I’m back.
Sheldon,"It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties."
Sheldon,Did you see that? He just cut the line.
Sheldon,"No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette."
Sheldon,What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
Sheldon,What if each of those people let someone cut?
Sheldon,But then each of those people let someone cut?
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Sheldon,"Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line."
Sheldon,"Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here."
Sheldon,You need to go to the back of the line.
Sheldon,Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
Sheldon,What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
Sheldon,"They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?"
Sheldon,"Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you."
Sheldon,"You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks."
Sheldon,"Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…"
Sheldon,I most certainly did not.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in."
Sheldon,"No, I can’t. This isn’t right."
Sheldon,"No, I could’ve done more."
Sheldon,"Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding."
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik."
Sheldon,Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
Sheldon,"Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re welcome."
Sheldon,"You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper."
Sheldon,"Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, I…"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I take care of him."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here."
Sheldon,"Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire."
Sheldon,"I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great."
Sheldon,Isn’t this nice?
Sheldon,Dr. Hofstadter.
Sheldon,"All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension."
Sheldon,Mom.
Sheldon,It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
Sheldon,I’m not sorry. That’s true.
Sheldon,"Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
Sheldon,"If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread."
Sheldon,"That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
Sheldon,"See, that’s funny because…"
Sheldon,I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
Sheldon,She’s still not answering.
Sheldon,I don’t like this at all.
Sheldon,Leonard? Leonard?
Sheldon,You realize you and I could become brothers.
Sheldon,I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
Sheldon,Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
Sheldon,Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,"Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking."
Sheldon,It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
Sheldon,"Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?"
Sheldon,"Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
Sheldon,"Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?"
Sheldon,"Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately."
Sheldon,And turned their phones off.
Sheldon,"You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."
Sheldon,"All right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"So, did you defile my mother or not?"
Sheldon,Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
Sheldon,Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
Sheldon,A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
Sheldon,What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
Sheldon,"What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate."
Sheldon,"Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?"
Sheldon,But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it."
Sheldon,"Great, now I have to start all over."
Sheldon,"You made God sad today, Mom."
Sheldon,"Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
Sheldon,"Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
Sheldon,Why do people cry at weddings?
Sheldon,"Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing."
Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. "
Sheldon,Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
Sheldon,"Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
Sheldon,"What, you’re not my mother."
Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
Sheldon,Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
Sheldon,"Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game."
Sheldon,"Oh, what did he say?"
Sheldon,That doesn’t sound terrifying.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?"
Sheldon,"Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
Sheldon,"Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?"
Sheldon,"We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me. "
Sheldon,I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
Sheldon,"Or in German, a Besserwisser."
Sheldon,I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
Sheldon,That’s what you said.
Sheldon,"This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say."
Sheldon,"All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?"
Sheldon,You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.
Sheldon,I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.
Sheldon,Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
Sheldon,Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
Sheldon,Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
Sheldon,"Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars."
Sheldon,"Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
Sheldon,They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.
Sheldon,"Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me."
Sheldon,"Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
Sheldon,Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
Sheldon,"Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you."
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,"See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets."
Sheldon,I never realized this building was classified.
Sheldon,"The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing."
Sheldon,Why? It clearly doesn’t work.
Sheldon,Impressive.
Sheldon,"Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts."
Sheldon,"It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all."
Sheldon,"I know, I was there."
Sheldon,How late?
Sheldon,One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.
Sheldon,What? You have some coffee.
Sheldon,And look how irritable it’s making you!
Sheldon,Fine.  I don’t think I can go much longer.
Sheldon,I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
Sheldon,"Ow, it does hurt."
Sheldon,"Oh, that was never happening."
Sheldon,I won’t be there.
Sheldon,"Huh, what?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
Sheldon,"I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin."
Sheldon,Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
Sheldon,I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
Sheldon,"The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers."
Sheldon,My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.
Sheldon,"No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no."
Sheldon,I want another one.
Sheldon,That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.
Sheldon,"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop."
Sheldon,"You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry. Yes, of course."
Sheldon,"Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
Sheldon,You guys stink.
Sheldon,"Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?"
Sheldon,I do.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but I do."
Sheldon,With what?
Sheldon,I thought I didn’t have a problem.
Sheldon,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,"Howard, can I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,"All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…"
Sheldon,You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
Sheldon,I can’t.
Sheldon,"No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing."
Sheldon,I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
Sheldon,But what if we can’t?
Sheldon,"He said start with it, not end with it."
Sheldon,The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
Sheldon,"We, we really appreciate it."
Sheldon,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
Sheldon,Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.
Sheldon,I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven."
Sheldon,Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
Sheldon,"If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it."
Sheldon,"Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
Sheldon,"Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. "
Sheldon,"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here."
Sheldon,"Historically, I don’t do well with change."
Sheldon,"You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
Sheldon,Very well. I’m on board.
Sheldon,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
Sheldon,"Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three."
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Sheldon,"Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
Sheldon,"Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along."
Sheldon,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
Sheldon,You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
Sheldon,"Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."
Sheldon,Okay. Talk.
Sheldon,"Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. "
Sheldon,You’re really okay with that?
Sheldon,"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now."
Sheldon,I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
Sheldon,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
Sheldon,It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
Sheldon,I guess this is it.
Sheldon,"You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please, let me go."
Sheldon,Oh. Bye.
Sheldon,I guess the experiment begins.
Sheldon,Which side of the bed would you prefer?
Sheldon,"No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose."
Sheldon,"Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
Sheldon,"Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
Sheldon,"Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
Sheldon,"No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
Sheldon,"Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
Sheldon,"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
Sheldon,I suppose that works.
Sheldon,Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
Sheldon,Be grateful I’m still in the room.
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
Sheldon,"Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
Sheldon,"No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
Sheldon,What are you doing down there?
Sheldon,Who are you calling? Aaargh!
Sheldon,"Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?"
Sheldon,Really? I slept great.
Sheldon,How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
Sheldon,"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
Sheldon,"Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
Sheldon,If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
Sheldon,How dare you?
Sheldon,"Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?"
Sheldon,"Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
Sheldon,"For science, maybe you should."
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,Great.
Sheldon,Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
Sheldon,Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
Sheldon,I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
Sheldon,"Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter."
Sheldon,Well I’m open to that.
Sheldon,I think we should see other people.
Sheldon,"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
Sheldon,"Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here."
Sheldon,"You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto "
Sheldon,She’s always complaining about people at work.
Sheldon,"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?"
Sheldon,I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
Sheldon,Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?
Sheldon,"If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
Sheldon,"Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
Sheldon,"Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
Sheldon,"No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
Sheldon,"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other."
Sheldon,You are truly wise.
Sheldon,"I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there."
Sheldon,"Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone."
Sheldon,"I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
Sheldon,I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
Sheldon,"My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman."
Sheldon,"I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first"
Sheldon,"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Sheldon,"Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to."
Sheldon,Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
Sheldon,"Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
Sheldon,"I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well."
Sheldon,That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
Sheldon,"Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level. "
Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
Sheldon,"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
Sheldon,"All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop."
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork."
Sheldon,"You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch."
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious."
Sheldon,"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
Sheldon,You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises."
Sheldon,Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
Sheldon,"The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
Sheldon,Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
Sheldon,"Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?"
Sheldon,She’s learning English from TV.
Sheldon,"Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
Sheldon,"So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together."
Sheldon,This is it. You are the practice round.
Sheldon,"You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks."
Sheldon,"Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine."
Sheldon,"Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you. 
Sheldon,"Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
Sheldon,"Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out. "
Sheldon,"All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
Sheldon,"You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
Sheldon,Do you know what else I love about you?
Sheldon,Your handwriting is impeccable.
Sheldon,"No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker."
Sheldon,Hmm?
Sheldon,You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
Sheldon,"You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em."
Sheldon,"Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
Sheldon,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
Sheldon,Hit it.
Sheldon,Who haven’t learned their place yet.
Sheldon,"Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them."
Sheldon,"So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me."
Sheldon,Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
Sheldon,"Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music."
Sheldon,"Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress."
Sheldon,So?
Sheldon,I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
Sheldon,"You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain."
Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold."
Sheldon,"Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
Sheldon,"I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
Sheldon,I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
Sheldon,"Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something."
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."
Sheldon,"Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her."
Sheldon,I don’t understand.
Sheldon,"So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas."
Sheldon,"Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her."
Sheldon,Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
Sheldon,It’s khoo-vakh. 
Sheldon,"No, no, he’s over there."
Sheldon,Are you going to confront Penny?
Sheldon,"Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk."
Sheldon,"Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?"
Sheldon,Interesting. Very interesting.
Sheldon,"Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
Sheldon,Leonard?
Sheldon,jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny? 
Sheldon,Why are you speaking English?
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, stop that."
Sheldon,Dayaj’a’ 
Sheldon,Qu’vatlh 
Sheldon,How could you lie to me?
Sheldon,It’s all right.
Sheldon,"Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
Sheldon,I’m open to the possibility.
Sheldon,"Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room."
Sheldon,But that’s my room.
Sheldon,But that’s my room.
Sheldon,But that’s my room.
Sheldon,"Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants."
Sheldon,"Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?"
Sheldon,"Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment."
Sheldon,I hate your apartment.
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena."
Sheldon,But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
Sheldon,"I’m not a child, don’t do that."
Sheldon,"Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that’s soothing."
Sheldon,I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
Sheldon,"I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow."
Sheldon,That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
Sheldon,Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?"
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
Sheldon,"What, you’re familiar with the reference?"
Sheldon,Exactly.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
Sheldon,"Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy."
Sheldon,How much will it hurt?
Sheldon,"On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
Sheldon,Eating a whole Altoid?
Sheldon,"No, this is for science. I can be brave for science."
Sheldon,"Oh, jiminy, that’s cold."
Sheldon,"All right, just warn me before you do it."
Sheldon,You tricked me. You didn’t say one.
Sheldon,"No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
Sheldon,Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
Sheldon,Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?
Sheldon,"Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful."
Sheldon,"I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
Sheldon,"What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s"
Sheldon,"I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one."
Sheldon,"Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
Sheldon,"Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
Sheldon,"Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
Sheldon,Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
Sheldon,"Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win."
Sheldon,"Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
Sheldon,"Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?"
Sheldon,"Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
Sheldon,Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
Sheldon,I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
Sheldon,"Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get."
Sheldon,"Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?"
Sheldon,"Well, hello."
Sheldon,Would you care for a brandy?
Sheldon,"Good choice, it’s disgusting."
Sheldon,Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
Sheldon,Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.
Sheldon,"Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters."
Sheldon,"Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco."
Sheldon,"You guys are aroused, right?"
Sheldon,Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
Sheldon,"Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
Sheldon,I know how to behave.
Sheldon,"Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
Sheldon,"Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice."
Sheldon,"Well, aren’t you a peach."
Sheldon,"Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it."
Sheldon,Who listens to the radio any more?
Sheldon,"You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert."
Sheldon,You want me to read a geology paper?
Sheldon,"Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why."
Sheldon,"I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
Sheldon,That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
Sheldon,Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
Sheldon,"I admire you, Leonard."
Sheldon,"You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
Sheldon,How did you deal with it?
Sheldon,"I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
Sheldon,Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
Sheldon,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…"
Sheldon,I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you."
Sheldon,"Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
Sheldon,Maybe you’re right.
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure."
Sheldon,And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
Sheldon,"Top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself."
Sheldon,"Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations."
Sheldon,"Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
Sheldon,"Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
Sheldon,Really? I didn’t know that.
Sheldon,"You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again."
Sheldon,"No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
Sheldon,I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
Sheldon,Sorry I’m moving slowly.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
Sheldon,I can’t take this any more.  Bert. 
Sheldon,"All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk."
Sheldon,"Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success."
Sheldon,"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened."
Sheldon,"No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
Sheldon,"We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go."
Sheldon,You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
Sheldon,"Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?"
Sheldon,"I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it."
Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
Sheldon,"Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool."
Sheldon,How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
Sheldon,"I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in."
Sheldon,"What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?"
Sheldon,Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
Sheldon,"Oh, actually, I would."
Sheldon,Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
Sheldon,"You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
Sheldon,"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
Sheldon,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
Sheldon,"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
Sheldon,"Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting."
Sheldon,"Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now."
Sheldon,What happened to them?
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?"
Sheldon,"That seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
Sheldon,"Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"
Sheldon,"Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
Sheldon,"Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
Sheldon,Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
Sheldon,It’s one of a kind.
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do."
Sheldon,I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?"
Sheldon,"Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games."
Sheldon,Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
Sheldon,"For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?"
Sheldon,"It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten."
Sheldon,"Yeah, take whatever you want."
Sheldon,But you don’t even like flags.
Sheldon,But I designed it.
Sheldon,But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
Sheldon,"Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted."
Sheldon,"Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned."
Sheldon,"All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn."
Sheldon,It’s a good thing you’re cute.
Sheldon,What do you think you’re doing?
Sheldon,This is the level you’re stooping to.
Sheldon,"So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around."
Sheldon,"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
Sheldon,"Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them."
Sheldon,"That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID."
Sheldon,And now you know as much about him as I do.
Sheldon,Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
Sheldon,I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
Sheldon,Dividing our belongings is difficult.
Sheldon,"I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
Sheldon,"In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
Sheldon,"I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
Sheldon,Amy? Wake up.
Sheldon,It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
Sheldon,"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
Sheldon,A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
Sheldon,And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
Sheldon,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities. 
Sheldon,I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
Sheldon,"Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals."
Sheldon,Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
Sheldon,I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
Sheldon,"It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide."
Sheldon,"That’s a bit childish, isn’t it? "
Sheldon,Grape. I find it the most mild.
Sheldon,"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
Sheldon,"Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle."
Sheldon,Very well.
Sheldon,"I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels."
Sheldon,"Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them."
Sheldon,"No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this."
Sheldon,Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
Sheldon,"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…"
Sheldon,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
Sheldon,Who’s killing the mood now?
Sheldon,Can I look yet?
Sheldon,Wowza.
Sheldon,"What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me."
Sheldon,"Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me."
Sheldon,You know I’ve been wanting to go.
Sheldon,"Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry."
Sheldon,Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
Sheldon,"She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop."
Sheldon,"But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
Sheldon,"I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
Sheldon,"Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say."
Sheldon,"Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted."
Sheldon,"Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about."
Sheldon,"It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius."
Sheldon,"Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating."
Sheldon,"Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
Sheldon,"It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way."
Sheldon,"Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…"
Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
Sheldon,Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
Sheldon,"There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it."
Sheldon,"Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower."
Sheldon,Anyway…
Sheldon,"Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
Sheldon,Welcome to Texas.
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes."
Sheldon,"All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not."
Sheldon,"What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there."
Sheldon,And what special circumstances are those?
Sheldon,"What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
Sheldon,"Well, this is highly insulting."
Sheldon,"I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato."
Sheldon,"Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying."
Sheldon,Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
Sheldon,"Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too."
Sheldon,And?
Sheldon,Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
Sheldon,"Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
Sheldon,"You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…"
Sheldon,"I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy."
Sheldon,I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
Sheldon,"Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me."
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,You managed the situation?
Sheldon,"So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life."
Sheldon,I have gotten much better at that.
Sheldon,What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter. 
Sheldon,How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Sheldon,"Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years."
Sheldon,Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.
Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
Sheldon,I was acting odd intentionally.
Sheldon,"Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  And here we are."
Sheldon,I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
Sheldon,"So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
Sheldon,"Hey, how’s life with your baby?"
Sheldon,To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.
Sheldon,"Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?"
Sheldon,What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
Sheldon,"It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy."
Sheldon,Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
Sheldon,"Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear? "
Sheldon,I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
Sheldon,"That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
Sheldon,Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
Sheldon,"Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall."
Sheldon,"At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?"
Sheldon,"If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?"
Sheldon,Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
Sheldon,Anything to drink?
Sheldon,"Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here."
Sheldon,"Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips."
Sheldon,"Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense. "
Sheldon,And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
Sheldon,You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
Sheldon,Bye.
Sheldon,Bye.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ll miss you too."
Sheldon,"Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one."
Sheldon,"Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea."
Sheldon,And it’s just the way you like it.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,"Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it."
Sheldon,"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
Sheldon,"You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?"
Sheldon,"Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh."
Sheldon,Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
Sheldon,"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?"
Sheldon,"Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different."
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you."
Sheldon,And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
Sheldon,"You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing. "
Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk."
Sheldon,There’s a cucumber in my water.
Sheldon,"Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody? "
Sheldon,"Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh. "
Sheldon,"Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?"
Sheldon,"I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
Sheldon,"If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
Sheldon,"I did this for free, let me get a little something."
Sheldon,"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition."
Sheldon,Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
Sheldon,"That’s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?"
Sheldon,Doesn’t like games. That’s one.
Sheldon,"Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
Sheldon,"So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don’t like you."
Sheldon,What? He said he was fine.
Sheldon,"Oh, that’s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
Sheldon,"Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive."
Sheldon,Yeah.
Sheldon,"We were discussing Raj’s recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him."
Sheldon,"Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
Sheldon,Then why didn’t you say that?
Sheldon,"Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
Sheldon,"Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re just showing off."
Sheldon,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.
Sheldon,"It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them."
Sheldon,You could make it a train room.
Sheldon,"I know, and Amy says I can’t have a train room."
Sheldon,Wonderful. Although I’m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.
Sheldon,"Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
Sheldon,"Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time."
Sheldon,You are happy?
Sheldon,"Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right. "
Sheldon,Sad.
Sheldon,"Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her."
Sheldon,"And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind."
Sheldon,"Hey, Leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector."
Sheldon,Surprisingly well.
Sheldon,"No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren’t you sweet?"
Sheldon,"Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry."
Sheldon,"What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone."
Sheldon,Yes.
Sheldon,It’s like you’re twins.
Sheldon,"Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters."
Sheldon,He’s still mad.
Sheldon,You first.
Sheldon,"Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you."
Sheldon,You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.
Sheldon,Gladly. Can we storm out?
Sheldon,Fine. I’ll just give them the finger.
Sheldon,Not really.
Sheldon,"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it."
Sheldon,"It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
Sheldon,"I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I’m not."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. You’re kind of a sad sack. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I’m just upset."
Sheldon,"I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird."
Sheldon,Yes?
Sheldon,"Oh, it’s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict."
Sheldon,"Uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again."
Sheldon,Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one.
Sheldon,"I did. You know, I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
Sheldon,"Hey, uh, Bernadette, let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?"
Sheldon,Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
Sheldon,"I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
Sheldon,"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics."
Sheldon,"Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
Sheldon,I don’t want to go home.
Sheldon,Then what?
Sheldon,"Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best."
Sheldon,Really?
Sheldon,"Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again."
Sheldon,"You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive."
Sheldon,No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
Sheldon,You.
Sheldon,"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
Sheldon,"Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing"
Sheldon,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?"
Sheldon,"I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
Sheldon,"Interesting. Well, so I was right."
Sheldon,"Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are."
Sheldon,Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish.
Sheldon,"Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo."
Sheldon,"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it."
Sheldon,"No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I guess it’s fixed."
Sheldon,That’s wrong.
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
Sheldon,"Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store.
Sheldon,"Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team."
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home."
Sheldon,I apologize that it’s so warm in here.
Sheldon,I’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.
Sheldon,May I borrow your water?
Sheldon,GPS says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.
Sheldon,There’s no way.
Sheldon,"Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
Sheldon,Kind of busy right now.
Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
Sheldon,"You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
Sheldon,It’s slowing down.
Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
Sheldon,"Oh, I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn’t see that."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Sheldon,"If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"Well, have a lovely evening."
Sheldon,"If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy."
Sheldon,"MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?"
Sheldon,"Bert, I insist that you join us."
Sheldon,Not at all. Amy?
Sheldon,"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
Sheldon,You want me to look at him and listen to him?
Sheldon,"Actually, we met online."
Sheldon,"Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again."
Sheldon,"No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
Sheldon,Why aren’t you talking to me?
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, now I’m sorry I asked."
Sheldon,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.
Sheldon,"Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works."
Sheldon,"Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together."
Sheldon,"I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized."
Sheldon,This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
Sheldon,"That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom."
Sheldon, Amy?
Sheldon,"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it."
Sheldon,"I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here."
Sheldon,"No, I was just excited to list him as a friend."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink."
Sheldon,That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.
Sheldon,Of course. 
Sheldon,"No, they’re private."
Sheldon,A little.
Sheldon,Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license.
Sheldon,I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.
Sheldon,"No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?"
Sheldon,"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert."
Sheldon,"Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
Sheldon,"Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."
Sheldon,Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.
Sheldon,"Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
Sheldon,I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.
Sheldon,"Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
Sheldon,He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
Sheldon,What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?
Sheldon,"No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it."
Sheldon,He sounds like a sociopath.
Sheldon,You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one."
Sheldon,She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
Sheldon,She’s gonna hate the panels.
Sheldon,"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
Sheldon,"You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard."
Sheldon,"Your father may have spoiled you, but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
Sheldon,I’m gonna go as Dumbledore.
Sheldon,That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.
Sheldon,"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either."
Sheldon,"No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
Sheldon,"I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
Sheldon,"I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I’d like to think she meant it."
Sheldon,Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.
Sheldon,"I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
Sheldon,He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.
Sheldon,"So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them."
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,"Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.
Sheldon,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job."
Sheldon,"Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…"
Sheldon,"Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
Sheldon,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?
Sheldon,"When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
Sheldon,"I’m a big boy, and if I missed one, I’d throw a big-boy tantrum."
Sheldon,"Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con."
Sheldon,Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.
Sheldon,"That’s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July."
Sheldon,There’s my pretty girlfriend.
Sheldon,What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
Sheldon,"Well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long, isn’t it?"
Sheldon,"I know our apartment’s small, but I think we can make room."
Sheldon,Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
Sheldon,"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine."
Sheldon,Roofing.
Sheldon,"Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room."
Sheldon,What about his dog?
Sheldon,I suppose that’s acceptable.
Sheldon,"If real dogs gave me buttons, I’d like them, too. Well, I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
Sheldon,And what is that supposed to mean?
Sheldon,"If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it."
Sheldon,"I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room."
Sheldon,"Oh, I’m outraged. "
Sheldon,"Well, that’s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me. "
Sheldon,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.
Sheldon,"I realize it’s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I’m feeling a bit replaced."
Sheldon,"Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?"
Sheldon,All set.
Sheldon,A housewarming gift for Raj.
Sheldon,"It’s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj’s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello."
Sheldon,"Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj."
Sheldon,"Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I’m sure you will, too."
Sheldon,"Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words."
Sheldon,"I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez."
Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Sheldon,I thought that was gonna break the other way.
Sheldon,Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy.
Sheldon,How come he can say it and I can’t?
Sheldon,"Honestly, I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days."
Sheldon,"Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
Sheldon,"Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
Sheldon,I have.
Sheldon,I hadn’t thought about that.
Sheldon,"I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you’re good."
Sheldon,"Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
Sheldon,"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you."
Sheldon,"No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
Sheldon,"Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."
Sheldon,"Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s."
Sheldon,I can’t sleep.
Sheldon,Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
Sheldon,Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything. 
Sheldon,What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?
Sheldon,That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
Sheldon,"Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert."
Sheldon,"You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
Sheldon,Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
Sheldon,"Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting."
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts."
Sheldon,So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
Sheldon,"Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?"
Sheldon,"Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I’ll wait."
Sheldon,"Well, don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we’re going for a drive."
Sheldon,"I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation."
Sheldon,It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple."
Sheldon,That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
Sheldon,"All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
Sheldon,Is it?
Sheldon,I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.
Sheldon,"Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"I’d write that down, but I can’t now, can I?"
Sheldon,"Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen."
Sheldon,Fire away.
Sheldon,"That’s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0."
Sheldon,"Aw, someone drew a penis in it."
Sheldon,"I’m sorry, go ahead."
Sheldon,"Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me."
Sheldon,"Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be."
Sheldon,"Yes, this is remarkable."
Sheldon,"By the way, your name can go first."
Sheldon,"Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense."
Sheldon,Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.
Sheldon,"All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races."
Sheldon,"No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine."
Sheldon,"Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
Sheldon,"Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape."
Sheldon,"Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive."
Sheldon,That is a daring and insightful solution. 
Sheldon,What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?
Sheldon,"Well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
Sheldon,"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
Sheldon,Science it is.
Sheldon,"Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I’m not the sharpest dresser."
Sheldon,Can you read them back?
Sheldon,"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk."
Sheldon,I love that one.
Sheldon,"Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Because I am.
Sheldon,"I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
Sheldon,"Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?"
Sheldon,"These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup."
Sheldon,Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
Sheldon,"Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes."
Sheldon,"The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
Sheldon,It’s five and a half.
Sheldon,BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.
Sheldon,The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
Sheldon,"You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way."
Sheldon,"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
Sheldon,"Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
Sheldon,Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.
Sheldon,I’m fine.
Sheldon,That didn’t happen.
Sheldon,Just do your laundry.
Sheldon,"I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry."
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix."
Sheldon,What I need is to get to work.
Sheldon,"What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?"
Sheldon,What’s going on? How’d I get here?
Sheldon,Home from work? What time is it?
Sheldon,Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
Sheldon,"Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine."
Sheldon,"At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?"
Sheldon,"My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, would you be a lamb?"
Sheldon,"Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."
Sheldon,"Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no. "
Sheldon,What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.
Sheldon,That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
Sheldon,I’m trying.
Sheldon,Why?
Sheldon,What does it say?
Sheldon,Where?
Sheldon,"I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe."
Sheldon,It’s hard to say.
Sheldon,It’s getting clearer.
Sheldon,"Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert."
Sheldon,"Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?"
Sheldon,"It’s called fitting in. By the way, good luck."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank goodness."
Sheldon,I swear.
Sheldon,Not to tell anyone.
Sheldon,The top secret military information I’m about to tell you.
Sheldon,We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.
Sheldon,Thank you for making me tea.
Sheldon,Yummy. And warm on my back.
Sheldon,You know exactly what I need.
Sheldon,That’s nice. Now in German.
Sheldon,Great. Now Mandarin.
Sheldon,Now Navajo.
Sheldon,"All right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we’re calling…"
Sheldon,"Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. That’s just where we have dinner."
Sheldon,"So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds."
Sheldon,Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.
Sheldon,"Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…"
Sheldon,"Oh, and do you remember what you said?"
Sheldon,And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones. 
Sheldon,"And now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments. "
Sheldon,"Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?"
Sheldon,"Bert, you’re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments."
Sheldon,Where’s Howard?
Sheldon,"Oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don’t know where I am."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Sheldon,"Ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes."
Sheldon,"Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
Sheldon,Hold on. We don’t know anything about this woman. 
Sheldon,Is she a geologist?
Sheldon,"Oh great, see you at seven. "
Sheldon,She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two.
Sheldon,"Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
Sheldon,See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.
Sheldon,You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.
Sheldon,"What’d you do, delete your photo?"
Sheldon,Fine.
Sheldon,"Aw, man."
Sheldon,"I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall."
Sheldon,Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?
Sheldon,Who’s ready to laugh?
Sheldon,"Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears"
Sheldon,"That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke."
Sheldon,"Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet."
Sheldon,He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
Sheldon,You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.
Sheldon,"Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
Sheldon,So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?
Sheldon,"Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
Sheldon,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Sheldon,"Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together. "
Sheldon,"Ooh, we already have our first call."
Sheldon,"Okay, one second."
Sheldon,I’m trying to shoot.
Sheldon,What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.
Sheldon,"Well, I don’t like it."
Sheldon,"No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
Sheldon,"I guess I just need to face it, I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch."
Sheldon,Yay.
Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
Sheldon,At the hands of those teenagers.
Sheldon,Boy teenagers.
Sheldon,"I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging."
Sheldon,"The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
Sheldon,"Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
Sheldon,Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.  
Sheldon,Hey.
Sheldon,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.
Sheldon,"Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control."
Sheldon,"Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?"
Sheldon,"For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you."
Sheldon,You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
Sheldon,"It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging."
Sheldon,"Howard, I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
Sheldon,"Okay, I think I got that."
Sheldon,"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?"
Sheldon,Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge.
Sheldon,"Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!"
Sheldon,I hurt myself juggling.
Sheldon,"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever."
Sheldon,"What, are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle."
Sheldon,"Wait, I need help getting down."
Sheldon,"Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
Sheldon,I’m returning this stuff to Howard.
Sheldon,"Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
Sheldon,"Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants."
Sheldon,Are you calling me a quitter?
Sheldon,This conversation is over.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"It’s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me."
Sheldon,This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40. 
Sheldon,So I’m running out of time.
Sheldon,"Oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me."
Sheldon,"Hey, I thought you were sweet on me."
Sheldon,You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
Sheldon,"I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it.  Ah, man."
Sheldon,"Thank you. No bendy straw, some party."
Sheldon,To success without Raj.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C."
Sheldon,"I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer."
Sheldon,Who else has access to this room?
Sheldon,This is disconcerting. 
Sheldon,Where did you move it?
Sheldon,"Wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
Sheldon,"If that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
Sheldon,"You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives."
Sheldon,"It’s okay, everything’s here."
Sheldon,"I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind."
Sheldon,Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?
Sheldon,I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
Sheldon,Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.
Sheldon,"No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail."
Sheldon,What’s the occasion?
Sheldon,"You’re so kind. You know, I don’t know how I ever got by without you."
Sheldon,"Well, I thought that, too, but I’ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you."
Sheldon,"No, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?"
Sheldon,"Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that."
Sheldon,I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
Sheldon,"Well, a lot, it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you’re not telling me?"
Sheldon,"Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill."
Sheldon,"Well, that’s wonderful. Congratulations."
Sheldon,What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important.
Sheldon,"Thank you, but I’ll be fine."
Sheldon,"Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too."
Sheldon,What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
Sheldon,I got the blues. My baby done left me.
Sheldon,"Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall."
Sheldon,"No, but that list was sounding a little thin."
Sheldon,So trick her.
Sheldon,"No, but you are, so I got you this as a present."
Sheldon,"No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
Sheldon,"The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…"
Sheldon,"Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
Sheldon,"Well, no, it’s just, I’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can’t Skype it to you."
Sheldon,"All right, then. Let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
Sheldon,"Or, what if we fold them?"
Sheldon,"Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
Sheldon,"Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve."
Sheldon,It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?
Sheldon,Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
Sheldon,And you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?
Sheldon,And when you’re at the gate?
Sheldon,And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?
Sheldon,And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.
Sheldon,And every morning.
Sheldon,"Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello. "
Sheldon,"And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do."
Sheldon,"Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."
Sheldon,How are you settling in?
Sheldon,"Now, I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking."
Sheldon,"Well, I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I’ll tell you that."
Sheldon,"I miss you, too."
Sheldon,I’m sorry you had to go through that.
Sheldon,You know you just split an infinitive.
Sheldon,I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
Sheldon,I’m going to admonish you.
Sheldon,That’s the only kind of admonishing I do.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, She’s back at Caltech for her postdoc."
Sheldon,"Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone."
Sheldon,Let’s sit somewhere else.
Sheldon,"So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
Sheldon,Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
Sheldon,"And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
Sheldon,"Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch"
Sheldon,"Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman. "
Sheldon,"Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech."
Sheldon,"Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer."
Sheldon,"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki."
Sheldon,We just went swimming.
Sheldon,"I was scared, but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
Sheldon,"Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
Sheldon,"Yes, we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep."
Sheldon,That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone.
Sheldon,"Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,She was part of the American team at CERN.
Sheldon,"Do you know, I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?"
Sheldon,I’ll get them.
Sheldon,"Oh, fun. Like a play date."
Sheldon,Here you go.
Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello, Amy."
Sheldon,"I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here."
Sheldon,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?
Sheldon,"I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?"
Sheldon,See? We both think so.
Sheldon,"Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed."
Sheldon,Of course.
Sheldon,That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.
Sheldon,Bye.
Sheldon,What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.
Sheldon,That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.
Sheldon,"That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
Sheldon,I already do.
Sheldon,"Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable."
Sheldon,"Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me."
Sheldon,"Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening."
Sheldon,I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
Sheldon,"Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating."
Sheldon,How thoughtful. Thank you.
Sheldon,"And I with you. Question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"
Sheldon,"Well, that would raise a number of problems. We’re colleagues. I’m currently in a relation… Excuse me a moment."
Sheldon, Amy. Will you marry me?
Sheldon,What’s happening.
Sheldon,"You’re not swelling, Howard."
Sheldon,Oh boy.
Sheldon,Mommy.
Sheldon,You called my mother?
Sheldon,I’m not hungry. 
Sheldon,Okay.
Sheldon,This is very awkward.
Sheldon,"I’m not staring, I’m mulling."
Sheldon,"This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I’m sorry too, but there’s just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don’t have dinosaurs. Well I’ll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you’re texting about me, and I’d really like you to stop."
Sheldon,Hello Penny.  
Sheldon,What kind of sick?
Sheldon,Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!
Sheldon,"Penny! Penny, I’m hungry. "
Sheldon,Uh-uh-uh. 
Sheldon,"So, this is engineering, huh? "
Sheldon,"Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They’ll come, they’ll settle and I’ll win the prize…"
Sheldon,Welcome Dennis Kim. 
Sheldon,"Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. "
Sheldon,Gentlemen.
Sheldon,Gentlemen.
Sheldon,The Brady Bunch? 
Sheldon,Romulan.
Sheldon,No. I can’t let you do this. 
Sheldon,None shall pass. 
Sheldon,Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
Sheldon,Aieee ya! Xia si wo le. 
Sheldon,Show me your mucus! Your mucus! 
Sheldon,This is not a tangerine bicycle. 
Sheldon,Hi Penny.
Sheldon,You must release me from my oath. 
Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m moving out. "
Sheldon,Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
Sheldon,"I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
Sheldon,When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.
Sheldon,"Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep."
Sheldon,Sit over there. Baby wipe?
Sheldon,Have we at this point met our social obligations?
Sheldon,Hmmmm?
Sheldon,Forget it.
Sheldon,It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
Sheldon,"Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava."
Sheldon,I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
Sheldon,"Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me."
Sheldon,"Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike."
Sheldon,"I have a bone to pick with you, sir."
Sheldon,Tell me what you see here.
Sheldon,"Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Oh my! That’s awfully sticky. Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?"
Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours."
Sheldon,"There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee."
Sheldon,There. We’re outlaws.
Sheldon,"Listen carefully. I’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter."
Sheldon,‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
Sheldon,"Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where’s the coffee?"
Sheldon,I guess I won’t be needing this.
Sheldon,"You set it on DTS, didn’t you?"
Sheldon,I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
Sheldon,"Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars."
Sheldon,Bad Leonard.
Sheldon,Freaky?
Sheldon,Gentlemen.
Sheldon,Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
Sheldon,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
Sheldon,"I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?"
Sheldon,"No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
Sheldon,You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.
Sheldon,Behind you.
Sheldon,Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
Sheldon,I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
Sheldon,"It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, thank you!"
Sheldon,It’s you! I touched you!
Sheldon,Mine!
Sheldon,"Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please."
Sheldon,"No, Goofy, no."
Sheldon,"Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas."
Sheldon,I can hear it!
Sheldon,I would hardly call that dialogue!
Sheldon,"Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!"
Sheldon,I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
Sheldon,That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
Sheldon,"EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam."
Sheldon,Junior Mints.
Sheldon,"The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas."
Sheldon,"The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…"
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow."
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Glory, hallelujah."
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…"
Sheldon,You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, I’m just here for your money. I don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert."
Sheldon,"I must confess I don’t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. Why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper."
Sheldon,"Okay, fine. I’ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham’s car is here for you."
Sheldon,Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
Sheldon,"I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home."
Sheldon,Help me! Come back! Penny!
Sheldon,Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
Sheldon,Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice."
Sheldon,"If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack."
Sheldon,You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
Sheldon,"Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again."
Sheldon,Me neither.
Sheldon,I need a tissue.This one got wet.
Sheldon,"Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even."
Sheldon,She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!"
Sheldon,"Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night."
Sheldon,Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
Sheldon,"Oh, that’ll be Kripke."
Sheldon,Ew!
Sheldon,I’m not sure how to do this.
Sheldon,"Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay."
Sheldon,"Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
Sheldon,I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.
Sheldon,"Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is."
Sheldon,Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
Sheldon,"Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails."
Sheldon,This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
Sheldon,Oh! It’s eating my face!
Sheldon,I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Sheldon,"President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university."
Sheldon,"And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end."
Sheldon,"Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?"
Sheldon,"Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in bed?"
Sheldon,"Me, too."
Sheldon,I can’t sleep.
Sheldon,"Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?"
Sheldon,I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
Sheldon,Do you have cufflinks?
Sheldon,"Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?"
Sheldon,"Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?"
Sheldon,I still can’t sleep.
Sheldon,"We’re fine, thank you."
Sheldon,"Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important."
Sheldon,"Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys."
Sheldon,"Hey, look. I won."
Sheldon,Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
Sheldon,"Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me."
Sheldon,"Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad."
Sheldon,"It’s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together."
Sheldon,Do you know what’s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That’s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
Sheldon,Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.
Sheldon,"Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I’m you. Get it?"
Sheldon,"Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you’re mad at me. I’m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop."
Sheldon,"Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That’s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?"
Sheldon,Shotgun.
Sheldon,Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
Sheldon,Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
Sheldon,"I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
Sheldon,Yes. Open it and check.
Sheldon,"But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars."
Sheldon,"It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
Sheldon,Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.
Sheldon,"Hello, Mother."
Sheldon,"Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?"
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,"And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders."
Sheldon,"Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse."
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life."
Sheldon,Hello.
Sheldon,Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
Sheldon,I’m surprised you have to ask.
Sheldon,"Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all."
Sheldon,Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
Sheldon,No they make my earlobes sweat.
Sheldon,What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?
Sheldon,This is my ticket to Star Wars….
Sheldon,"Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
Sheldon,"Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses."
Sheldon,Popcorn’s on me.
Sheldon,No.
Sheldon,The light’s green.
Sheldon,"Amy, quick, lock the door."
Sheldon,"Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen."
Sheldon,Whoopee!
Sheldon,Penny. Zucchini bread.
Sheldon,"Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces."
Sheldon,"You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location."
Sheldon,"No, I’m not."
Sheldon,"No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!"
Sheldon,This is delightful.
Sheldon,It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
Sheldon,Because I called shotgun. Remember?
Sheldon,You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
Sheldon,"Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider."
Sheldon,"You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?"
Sheldon,Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
Sheldon,"This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go."
Sheldon,I have an override switch.
Sheldon,Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
Sheldon,"That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is."
Sheldon,"Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running."
Sheldon,I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
Sheldon,Sing me Soft Kitty.
Sheldon,Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
Sheldon,Closer to the microphone.
Sheldon,No. You have to start over.
Sheldon,Bazinga.
Sheldon,And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
Sheldon,"Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door."
Sheldon,Be a lamb and open it for me.
Sheldon,"You think you have me stymied, don’t you?"
Sheldon,"Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me."
Sheldon,He’s a lamb. You’re not.
Sheldon,Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
Sheldon,Can you tell me the specials this evening?
Sheldon,The Great and Powerful Woz.
Sheldon,I must speak to him.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?"
Sheldon,Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
Sheldon,It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
Sheldon,"One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"Aw, nuts."
Sheldon,"Leonard, are you listening to me?  "
Sheldon,…of AP Calculus.
