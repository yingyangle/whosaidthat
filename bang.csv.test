0,Amy,"o’er the land of the free, and the home of the… next."
2,Amy,"that’s enough. sheldon, sheldon, give it!"
9,Amy,neurobiologist. your check engine light is on.
2066,Amy,please don’t.
22,Amy,then 128.
23,Amy,"in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the second world war?"
25,Amy,correct. my turn.
27,Amy,isn’t it obvious?
28,Amy,we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
2077,Amy,"think about it. if we had a family there, our kids would be martians."
2079,Amy,"i’d say i’m sorry i asked, except i didn’t."
36,Amy,shamy?
39,Amy,"like everybody else’s. subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. thank you for asking. why is she not taking our order?"
40,Amy,really? i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently.
44,Amy,"it’s very impressive, for theoretical work."
49,Amy,we appear to have reached an impasse.
53,Amy,excellent point.
2101,Amy,"ooh, please do, rajesh."
55,Amy,i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
2102,Amy,we won’t know if there’s equality until female thor has a baby and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
2104,Amy,and girls.
2106,Amy,who cares? did they mention leonard?
2111,Amy,"and if i had a friend, they might have told me that."
2117,Amy,"uh, it, it’s been a long time. i don’t know. i’m probably pretty rusty."
71,Amy,sheldon?
73,Amy,in what way are you screwed? all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that i’m in a relationship.
2122,Amy,can you please pass the salt?
2123,Amy,is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
2124,Amy,"no, sheldon."
81,Amy,"actually, as the newest member of your social group, i believe i’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
85,Amy,i’m a girl.
90,Amy,what’s the dress code?
2141,Amy,"well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
2142,Amy,it’s a big fort.
2143,Amy,pg. some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
2144,Amy,you got yourself a sleepover.
2145,Amy,would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
2147,Amy,"yes, they are."
2150,Amy,"and you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
2153,Amy,with a beautiful girl on your arm.
2154,Amy,it’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
109,Amy,"oh, that’s an excellent question. for two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company."
110,Amy,i don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
2163,Amy,"really? that’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
2165,Amy,"i’ve been thinking about them, too, sheldon. being your girlfriend is so challenging. emotionally, physically. i’ve been incredibly patient for years."
119,Amy,hoo.
2170,Amy,hold on. you’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
126,Amy,"very well. if you die and donate your body to science, i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon."
129,Amy,"oh, that sounds like fun."
134,Amy,ask what?
2187,Amy,it’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
2189,Amy,yeah.
2192,Amy,like you’re doing right now?
2195,Amy,i’m hanging up.
2197,Amy,because we’re broken up.
151,Amy,"you reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
2199,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. i know it’s hard. it’s hard for me, too. but i’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
157,Amy,"excuse me? zack? i am amy farrah fowler. we met the other night. i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. until i met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. and yet here i stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs."
2207,Amy,good-bye.
162,Amy,that’s too bad. i was hoping you could be my plus-one at the institute of interdisciplinary studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
2211,Amy,i’m gonna kill him.
2212,Amy,"i don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
2213,Amy,i only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
2218,Amy,"so, penny, how’s married life?"
173,Amy,are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
2225,Amy,really? you have a piercing gun?
178,Amy,sometimes i think it might be nice to have one.
2228,Amy,who?
182,Amy,"of course, we’re best friends."
2230,Amy,how long do you think you can keep it from him?
188,Amy,because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
2237,Amy,"oh, maybe later. your pig dying made me sad. and a little hungry."
190,Amy,"well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
2242,Amy,i don’t think that was the point of the movie.
203,Amy,i came as quickly as i could.
2253,Amy,i don’t have much experience turning men down. it wasn’t so much fun.
2256,Amy,"i don’t know. i guess i assumed that i would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
213,Amy,i’m regretting my earlier cattiness. she is an absolute delight.
2262,Amy,how have you been?
229,Amy,"yo, p-dog."
2277,Amy,"well, i don’t have much experience dating, so i decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
2280,Amy,okay. but i’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
239,Amy,"you know, if being on your own is new to you, i’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies i’ve perfected over the years. for example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
2288,Amy,"well, i’m having a good time, too. if you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
244,Amy,i think you’re on.
249,Amy,"believe me, it’s there, we all have it. hit me with some more booze, and i’ll show you."
2299,Amy,really? you-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
2300,Amy,i have a dvd of that lecture.
2303,Amy,"no, you’re not."
2304,Amy,thank you.
259,Amy,fascinating work. i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
2311,Amy,sure. heh.
265,Amy,i should think so. that’s gold.
266,Amy,do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
2313,Amy,no one can go with you?
2315,Amy,"sheldon, i can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
269,Amy,"sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse. in other news, i’m thinking of starting an herb garden. mum’s the word. gotta go."
2317,Amy,see you then.
2321,Amy,no. you?
275,Amy,pun intended?
278,Amy,as good an explanation as any.
2326,Amy,i don’t know. just ask me whatever comes to mind.
280,Amy,wow. is there anything on there about orthotics?
281,Amy,"fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
285,Amy,you smell like baby powder.
286,Amy,"oh, i’m not confused at all. you’re like a sexy toddler."
2333,Amy,just one. are you doing okay?
2337,Amy,sure. what is it?
2339,Amy,"it’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill."
292,Amy,would you like to come in for a nightcap?
293,Amy,i have yoo-hoo.
2343,Amy,but you can pal around with a hagfish?
296,Amy,don’t be silly. he’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
297,Amy,i’m giving him emphysema. the least i can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
2344,Amy,"isn’t that gross? i mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
302,Amy,i trained ricky how to smoke. i can train him to shoot a poison dart. no jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
2350,Amy,"we are. but i was hoping, maybe…"
305,Amy,"you’re being too literal. my point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
307,Amy,i hope you don’t take what i’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
316,Amy,"you okay in there, bestie?"
317,Amy,"the reason i ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
2364,Amy,why not?
320,Amy,"no, it’s not. it’s a strategic manoeuvre. leonard’s new girlfriend is testing bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. that bitch is crafty."
2372,Amy,"no, i, i think it’s neat. oh."
329,Amy,"oh, my metatarsal are barking."
2378,Amy,"no, it, it, it’s okay. keep going?"
334,Amy,"so, are you off to dinner with priya, howard and bernadette?"
337,Amy,good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
2388,Amy,i think i’ll just stick to mexican.
342,Amy,how do you want to handle it?
2391,Amy,you shut your damn mouth. you actually heard him say this?
346,Amy,"calm down. everything’s going to be okay.  we may have to kill her. bernadette, i’m putting you on speakerphone. where are you now?"
347,Amy,"oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. what’s the problem?"
2395,Amy,"hi, sheldon."
2397,Amy,do you like it?
351,Amy,architect. where would you have met an astronaut?
355,Amy,i was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
360,Amy,don’t flatter yourself. your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. i could just as easily have paralyzed you.
2409,Amy,"well, i’ve been waiting for this for so long, i’ve just built it up in my head. i don’t know what to expect."
2414,Amy,"okay, well, i should unpack."
374,Amy,"oh, i could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
2422,Amy,are you feeling any better?
2423,Amy,"why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, i’ll explain to you why you’re wrong."
380,Amy,"five, six, seven, eight. tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
381,Amy,oh… you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
2428,Amy,"i said what’s new, but sure."
2429,Amy,did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
2434,Amy,great. now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
2435,Amy,glad i could help.
388,Amy,"yes, i am."
397,Amy,"no, he didn’t."
2447,Amy,"i have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
2451,Amy,"well, maybe i don’t like you either."
2452,Amy,i think i should leave.
2456,Amy,"penny, did you know about this?"
412,Amy,"i’m glad to hear you say that, because i’m having a wonderful time. hmm, i said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
2460,Amy,don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
2464,Amy,"well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
418,Amy,"well, i had a delightful evening, leonard. we should do this again sometime."
419,Amy,glad to hear it. i need someone to accompany me to the wedding of dr. moranelli and dr. gustufson this friday. they’re kind of the brad and angelina of the primatology department.
2468,Amy,"okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
422,Amy,"not without cutting his head open, no. how about making my eyes like cleopatra?"
424,Amy,i got you this to give to me.
429,Amy,"why shouldn’t they be? they have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. in some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
430,Amy,"leonard, you may not have noticed, but i am being a delight here. and you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
431,Amy,"i have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
433,Amy,really? are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? i am.
2482,Amy,"oh. uh, we-we have another caller. hi. you’re on fun with flags."
2484,Amy,"well, i, i wouldn’t say right away."
2485,Amy,"oh, looks like we just lost kripke."
2487,Amy,now?
440,Amy,"i excel at spatial reasoning, and i had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
442,Amy,"no, thanks. i’m gonna head home."
444,Amy,great. until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me.
447,Amy,"no, but it’s only a matter of time. how could i have not seen this coming? now i’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
456,Amy,a floppy disk?
457,Amy,how did wil wheaton get on the list?
2507,Amy,"yeah, tell us."
460,Amy,he’s great.
461,Amy,are you getting sick?
2511,Amy,how could you do that?
464,Amy,"sheldon, we’re all animals. and granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
2514,Amy,"oh, no. sheldon’s drunk texting me."
2515,Amy,would you like to sing karaoke with us.
470,Amy,who didn’t? your skin is like alabaster. do you even have pores?
2523,Amy,but it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
476,Amy,"i don’t know, four or five years."
478,Amy,just the two of them?
481,Amy,i wanted to be alone.
2529,Amy,"well, i think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
2531,Amy,"maybe later i’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
2532,Amy,oh. penny says everyone’s there. are you ready?
2539,Amy,"hey, everybody, listen up."
2541,Amy,"so, have you been having any morning sickness?"
501,Amy,"hey, cuddles."
503,Amy,"didn’t you go to high school, leonard? parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
2551,Amy,"well, to be fair, howard’s idea was based on sheldon’s math."
2556,Amy,sheldon.
510,Amy,"oh, my gosh. no one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. well, that’s not true. once, but then they all died."
2559,Amy,"sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? you know that one’s out-of-date."
2563,Amy,get a new computer.
2565,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly."
518,Amy,"what are you, a nun? come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
2570,Amy,yes.
2573,Amy,knock it off or i’ll start making w-h sounds for words that just have a w.
528,Amy,"sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. just like you did with the mailman."
2576,Amy,or you could just look into my eyes.
2577,Amy,"well, you know, as long as you’re happy."
2582,Amy,"sheldon, just tell me."
535,Amy,or we play travel twister.
536,Amy,"excuse me. i’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. and i’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. what do you say, bestie? we can do shirts and skins. i’m shirts. called it."
2586,Amy,will you please tell me where we’re going?
543,Amy,i’m listening.
553,Amy,"penny, i said right hand red."
556,Amy,what do you want me to do about it?
2607,Amy,"baby steps, i guess."
564,Amy,"i think your mistake is doing it over the phone. if they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
568,Amy,how about donating some of your clothes?
2618,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go with them."
2619,Amy,"you know, if that study’s real, leonard might come back smarter than you."
572,Amy,"what is it, the fuzz?"
578,Amy,"sheldon, i’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
2629,Amy,she’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. this could take a while.
2630,Amy,"no, it’s only if you’ve done it."
2635,Amy,never have i ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
590,Amy,no.
2640,Amy,what’s going on with him?
593,Amy,"too bad. if he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
2642,Amy,"well, i know how he feels. i never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
2646,Amy,"you know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
608,Amy,i’ll say.
2656,Amy,that was scary.
610,Amy,i’m surrendering to fun.
2657,Amy,but you always say that you want to win a nobel prize.
2658,Amy,"well, it sounds like a nice night. we should go."
613,Amy,it’s ferdinand t. flag. i thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
2662,Amy,"oh, we’re the first ones here."
622,Amy,they’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
626,Amy,"come on, sheldon. we can be like marie curie and her husband, pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. screw beauty and the beast, that’s the love story disney should tell."
627,Amy,"oh, i’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
630,Amy,soap spots. wash ’em again.
2679,Amy,what are you doing here? you’re not sheldon.
2680,Amy,hold on. he paid you to get out of spending time with me?
2681,Amy,we’re not going shopping together.
634,Amy,"yeah, good for you. now, start counting."
2684,Amy,"i’m sorry, i’ve been going on and on."
2685,Amy,i called him babe once. he asked me to get a drug test.
2688,Amy,three minutes. and he used a kitchen timer. i felt like a soft-boiled egg.
2692,Amy,fine.
2699,Amy,"wait, now i’m just some lousy maid of honour?"
656,Amy,"no, no, before i met you, i was a mousy wallflower. but look at me now. i’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. with a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. open it. open it."
2711,Amy,what took you guys so long?
665,Amy,thank you. wait. where’d the painting go?
2720,Amy,you’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
674,Amy,"yes, too much. because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. i clearly like you more than you like me."
2723,Amy,does that help?
2725,Amy,"you did already know, right?"
2727,Amy,where did you get empty dove bar wrappers?
2730,Amy,"oh, but you did it so well. that’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
684,Amy,little higher on the right.
2733,Amy,"hi. howard told me you were working late, so i brought dinner."
2735,Amy,"well, i came to see how you were feeling, but i’m guessing still angry?"
689,Amy,sure.
692,Amy,"well, this isn’t a crisis. why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
695,Amy,that was kind of uncalled for.
699,Amy,she’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
2750,Amy,no.
704,Amy,"i think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. it’s like a vacation for your teeth."
2753,Amy,and you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
706,Amy,thank you. that means a lot to me.
2756,Amy,i think we’re good.
2759,Amy,about five weeks.
712,Amy,"oh, that’s good."
714,Amy,"not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. i mean, think about it. i’m dating sheldon cooper."
717,Amy,do you ever worry about leonard doing that to you?
718,Amy,i don’t think i want to play a game.
721,Amy,that’d be my boyfriend. happier playing his dopey star trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
2772,Amy,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever. do you have any advice?
2778,Amy,"i’ve never lived with someone, either. this is a lot for me, too."
731,Amy,you’re hurting me.
2780,Amy,thank you.
735,Amy,rain check.
738,Amy,"hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
740,Amy,"i’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
745,Amy,"oh, thank god. i’m still a maid of honour. "
746,Amy,this is kind of hot.
2796,Amy,"oh, oh, oh."
749,Amy,"tempting choices, but i have something special planned for tonight."
751,Amy,"i had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why i’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
752,Amy,i have devised an experiment that i believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
754,Amy,"we’ll see. let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
756,Amy,fine. there’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. why don’t you have a seat.
2804,Amy,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
758,Amy,not even strawberry quik?
759,Amy,"oh, i know. i think it will go nicely with what i have prepared for dinner."
2806,Amy,"what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? i mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. and you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
762,Amy,we’re playing doctor. star trek style.
2812,Amy,do you want to go to our place and make out?
766,Amy,"well, it was going to be mine."
2815,Amy,"sheldon, i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
2818,Amy,we sleep together once a year. you want other partners?
772,Amy,"excuse me, i’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
776,Amy,"all right, that’s enough from the both of you."
2825,Amy,"he put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without amy’s hair on the soap."
2826,Amy,maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
2829,Amy,me.
791,Amy,"sheldon, how could you do this? it’s our second anniversary."
792,Amy,thank you.
793,Amy,have i ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis? 
794,Amy,you know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? they devour their mate.
2842,Amy,"well, that’s so nice. who’s coming?"
796,Amy,you know what? i’m done with this.
2844,Amy,that’s an odd mix of people.
2850,Amy,how old was it
804,Amy,‘cause i’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
2853,Amy,things didn’t work out?
806,Amy,you’re not answering the question. do you love him?
2856,Amy,"no, stuart, don’t."
2859,Amy,maybe i can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
2862,Amy,we’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
816,Amy,"regardless, don’t say anything to leonard."
2864,Amy,did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis…
2866,Amy,"oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone."
2867,Amy,"well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
2869,Amy,"thanks, but you don’t have to."
2874,Amy,"or damp wall, just as bad."
830,Amy,he knows my last name. i’m his girlfriend. we have a contract and everything. i’ll send you a pdf.
2879,Amy,let it go.
2880,Amy,food’s here.
833,Amy,you’re right. i don’t have to worry about sheldon.
836,Amy,"i’m not suspicious. i just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  aha!"
839,Amy,"really? because just before you became my best friend, i did this all over your apartment."
841,Amy,"really? i don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting leonard. were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. by the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out."
842,Amy,"so says your prefrontal cortex. but meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to leonard, it must be because he’s desirable."
845,Amy,"me, too. but we’ll see him tomorrow."
2896,Amy,"sorry, you brought it up?"
850,Amy,now?
851,Amy,"uh, hand. uh, nail, polish?"
2899,Amy,sorry.
853,Amy,"all right, let’s keep it simple. how about darts?"
2906,Amy,i understand. i’ll leave you be.
859,Amy,"ready, set, wrestle.  one, two, three, pin."
2907,Amy,of course. jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
864,Amy,and my boyfriend?
866,Amy,"that’s not always true. last night i gave sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated."
868,Amy,he takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
2917,Amy,"okay. three, two, and we’re done."
2923,Amy,no reason we can’t start right now.
877,Amy,"sheldon, get in here."
2925,Amy,"you know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
879,Amy,i once looked in sheldon’s underwear drawer. he yelled at me. but now i know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
2927,Amy,"so, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
2928,Amy,"good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
2932,Amy,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
885,Amy,"you know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
886,Amy,it’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
2934,Amy,"sheldon, i’m not ready to have a baby."
2936,Amy,not right now.
892,Amy,i feel like i’m in high school again.
895,Amy,"sorry, sheldon, you were brilliant as always. wil, that was a little wooden."
2946,Amy,it was like being hit on by rat pack pee-wee herman.
902,Amy,cut.
905,Amy,can i speak to you for a second?
2955,Amy,what happened?
2958,Amy,anybody else want to try? i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
2961,Amy,yep.
2963,Amy,what about me and sheldon?
2964,Amy,"ever since i met penny, i’ve been envious of her looks."
2965,Amy,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off.
920,Amy,"i know, sheldon should just let howard have his little moment in the sun."
922,Amy,if and when?
2970,Amy,"great, what’d you have in mind?"
2975,Amy,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again.
2976,Amy,"well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
931,Amy,he had my car towed. it cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
2979,Amy,so do you.
933,Amy,"don’t play dumb with me, sister. you tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars."
935,Amy,you?
2984,Amy,"i think he might be right. also, who is that?"
2985,Amy,"so, no one’s gonna tell me? okay."
2987,Amy,"sheldon. okay, you can have this back in the morning."
2994,Amy,just don’t smoke.
948,Amy,"sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?"
2997,Amy,"oh, uh, i don’t know. sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
951,Amy,"thank you, sheldon."
3001,Amy,i’m sorry.
3009,Amy,stop talking about trains.
3011,Amy,i got a gryffindor robe for you.
966,Amy,"oh, sheldon, am i glad you’re back. taking a turn for the worst. i think i’m going to need another bath."
971,Amy,i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie.
3021,Amy,sheldon and i are living together.
3027,Amy,they all look the same to me.
992,Amy,forget it. i don’t expect you guys to understand.
3043,Amy,are you going to?
996,Amy,"i do. and don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too."
3045,Amy,"we’re ignoring the fins, okay."
999,Amy,"she’s right. but say the word, i got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. one of them could end up in the backseat of her car. or her shower."
3047,Amy,that’s exactly what she was saying.
1011,Amy,so stupid.
1012,Amy,what a waste of time.
1016,Amy,yeah.
1018,Amy,"we are. we’re just, uh, giving you a head start."
1019,Amy,"it says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of thor."
3066,Amy,but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? i get that.
3071,Amy,i will bring them home so you can show me how godzilla takes a shower. 
1024,Amy,hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
3074,Amy,bye.
1027,Amy,did that ever happen?
1029,Amy,"all right, well, how was work today? did you exchange your research with kripke?"
3079,Amy,"i don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
1032,Amy,how’s that?
1033,Amy,children’s toy.
1035,Amy,"so, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?"
3084,Amy,it’s there on purpose. it’s refreshing.
1037,Amy,like a dog-boy.
1042,Amy,tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
1043,Amy,see? you can’t. i’m gonna go see if leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
3090,Amy,and also a little sad.
3098,Amy,yes.
1051,Amy,and this is amy.
3100,Amy,stop enjoying their fight.
3101,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go."
1056,Amy,"then what the hell, sheldon? we have been going out for over two years, and i have been nothing but patient with you. i watch your dopey space movies. i signed your ridiculous contract. i even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. i am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. you give me one good reason why i can’t live here."
3105,Amy,i’m sorry leonard and penny hurt your feelings.
1059,Amy,you’re a coward.
1065,Amy,"and i appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, i decided i was being selfish. so, i cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate valentine’s day."
1066,Amy,"by doing none of it. no dinner, no romance, no gifts. we stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved star war trek things."
3115,Amy,wow. he finally used it. what’d you do?
1069,Amy,"i’m your girlfriend. that’s my job. and i know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return."
3124,Amy,"hey, there’s another dance club nearby. i mean, i don’t know how you feel about latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
1077,Amy,"oh, that’s right. how’d it go with penny?"
3126,Amy,"i’m not sad. i mean, hello."
3132,Amy,"i’m not even engaged once. i don’t even know if sheldon thinks about marriage. i’m not getting any younger. honestly, i kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
3137,Amy,"hey, sheldon, i found a great restaurant for date night."
1091,Amy,hooky? i’ve never played hooky in my life. my mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
1092,Amy,"me, too."
1098,Amy,"come on, do it with us."
3146,Amy,"oh, really. anybody we know?"
1100,Amy,then how do we decide?
1104,Amy,"oh, it’s okay, i’m used to it. the other day at whole foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle."
1105,Amy,his quirks just make you love him more. someone please agree with me.
1106,Amy,i can’t believe he set it on fire.
3154,Amy,"okay, literally any other topic."
3156,Amy,you-you know about that?
1110,Amy,"sheldon, that’s not a real thing."
1112,Amy,absolutely.
1117,Amy,"you didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. and he cried because he was so proud of you."
3166,Amy,what is this?
3168,Amy,"well, i do appreciate you working on this."
3170,Amy,interesting. you really have secrets you don’t tell me?
3172,Amy,why? are they naughty?
3177,Amy,"well, that’s sweet. i bet you’ll have fun."
3179,Amy,my aunt’s funeral?
3180,Amy,"well, i’m not going, but i do think it’s nice you want to."
1133,Amy,the fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. it makes us?
3181,Amy,"look at you, going to comic-con, talking about ewoks. i really have become the cool one around here."
1137,Amy,she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause.
3187,Amy,"wait, wait, wait, what’s leonard lying about?"
3189,Amy,"no, you’re not gonna tell them anything. you’re gonna stay out of it."
3191,Amy,hi. 
3194,Amy,because you don’t want her to go to comic-con.
1147,Amy,"all i’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…"
1149,Amy,yep. your turn.
1152,Amy,"come on, you can do this."
1153,Amy,"yeah, sounds like a drag."
3202,Amy,"no, sheldon. we are not getting a life-size spider-man statue."
3205,Amy,"well, sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland."
1158,Amy,"no rules? we’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the blue man group, are we?"
1162,Amy,"‘cause last time i saw him, i threw new ones and it got me nothing."
3211,Amy,"well, this isn’t an easy time for him. he’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
1177,Amy,wow. talk dirty to me.
1178,Amy,"i guess i know that. it’s just, part of me wants more."
3229,Amy,"i want to say aw, but i’m gonna say ew."
1183,Amy,i remove your armour. what do you do?
3232,Amy,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on?
1186,Amy,"hello, rajesh."
3234,Amy,"yes, i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
3236,Amy,"you know, i like harp lessons, but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. what are you working on?"
3245,Amy,terrific. do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
3247,Amy,"number two, disagreements can happen politely. there’s no need to call an idea stupid."
3249,Amy,"number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
1204,Amy,so what happened? how’d it go?
1210,Amy,"we could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and i remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
3259,Amy,"i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
3263,Amy,"how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey, wait a second. wait. delta t could equal alpha sub-zero."
1222,Amy,what?
3271,Amy,"well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
3272,Amy,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
1233,Amy,driving sheldon to work.
3281,Amy,"it’s okay, i’m sure we’ll find it."
3285,Amy,phones can do that?
1241,Amy,"yeah, me, too."
1242,Amy,stop that. penny is not a liability.
3291,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
3295,Amy,"and don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. just keep trying.  oh, thank god, welcome to fun with flags."
3296,Amy,and what does that have to do with flags?
1253,Amy,i love neil diamond.
1260,Amy,ain’t no big surprise.
1261,Amy,and i’ll tell you some lies. 
1262,Amy,there’s a neil diamond concert next month.
1264,Amy,"she got the way to move me, honey."
1266,Amy,"i enjoyed it. when you told me i was going to be losing my virginity, i didn’t think you meant showing me raiders of the lost ark for the first time."
1273,Amy,that sounds lovely. why are you rubbing your hands together?
1274,Amy,of course i’m in.
3321,Amy,"all right, well, have fun."
3322,Amy,"well, what do you want me to do?"
3343,Amy,"sheldon, i’m so sorry."
1299,Amy,gentlemen.
1300,Amy,and this is dr. gunderson from stockholm.
3350,Amy,"oh, i’m sorry to hear that."
1305,Amy,"oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. sorry, uh, better?"
3362,Amy,"are, are you sure?"
3365,Amy,i don’t know. sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.
3368,Amy,"hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
3371,Amy,"sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
1330,Amy,so you just got lucky?
1331,Amy,"you and me both, brother. it doesn’t matter. the element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
1332,Amy,"you know, sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
3378,Amy,"okay, the car is waiting. do you want to walk me downstairs?"
1334,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. you don’t deserve any credit. all you did was misread some numbers on a table. a very easy table, too. honestly, i’m embarrassed for you."
3380,Amy,do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
3382,Amy,we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
3386,Amy,i won’t.
1340,Amy,sorry.
3388,Amy,good thinking.
3389,Amy,thank you. that means a lot.
3391,Amy,"actually, i want to hear about you. how are things at home?"
1344,Amy,"yes, and i’ve heard so much about you. hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. i can’t believe i dress like a celebrity."
3393,Amy,"it’s so strange, earlier today i ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
1352,Amy,sheldon.
3401,Amy,"oh. really? uh, when did you meet her?"
3402,Amy,"huge fan, you say?"
3414,Amy,she’s what?
1368,Amy,you want to say sorry.
3417,Amy,it’s not important.
1370,Amy,"i must say, sheldon, you’re handling this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity."
3419,Amy,amy farrah fowler.
3423,Amy,"what up, bestie? good news. thanks to you, i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
1376,Amy,we do. and i expect you to be on your best behaviour.
3428,Amy,"everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. everybody hurts, sometimes."
1381,Amy,it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. were you unable to consummate the marriage?
3430,Amy,"you know, can i borrow that movie? those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
3432,Amy,"this is maid of honour amy farrah fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
1388,Amy,did you guys know penny married zack three years ago?
1389,Amy,ooh!
3443,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
3445,Amy,"okay, sheldon, thanks for checking in. talk to you tomorrow? oh, okay, bye."
3446,Amy,"hey, girlfriend. can i get a what what?"
1401,Amy,"sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
3452,Amy,"penny? i really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
3453,Amy,hello.
1407,Amy,you should probably go.
1408,Amy,"a little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
3457,Amy,"i’m not gonna be your roommate, sheldon."
1412,Amy,how come you never said she was pregnant?
1413,Amy,can i give you a ride to the airport?
1420,Amy,"which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without sheldon. same goes with you guys. if leonard wasn’t with penny, she never would have set you up."
1425,Amy,"wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
1426,Amy,"it’s hard to say, my life would be so different."
1429,Amy,yay.
1433,Amy,i wish i could believe you. i also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in rice sheldon.
1436,Amy,i am in the mix. and i’m the hottest one.
1439,Amy,i missed you.
1446,Amy,congratulations.
1459,Amy,he’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
1460,Amy,"it’s exhausting. do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy?"
1464,Amy,"that’s okay. uh, bert, this is howard and rajesh. guys, this is bert."
1465,Amy,this is so pretty. bert works for the geology department.
1466,Amy,"oh, you forgot your quartz."
1467,Amy,he’s nice.
1468,Amy,"what?! no, he doesn’t."
1469,Amy,so? he does that every day. oh.
1471,Amy,should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
1472,Amy,what do i do? i don’t want to hurt his feelings.
1473,Amy,i guess it hasn’t come up.
1482,Amy,don’t say that. 
1489,Amy,really? you would do that?
1490,Amy,thank you.
1491,Amy,"last week, you spent that on a little dress. "
1495,Amy,there sure are a lot of little kids here.
1497,Amy,it was. till my hamster ate all her babies. it got less cute really fast.
1500,Amy,gosh.
1507,Amy,"before you get upset, i believe i’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
1514,Amy,an alcoa fa-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 pullman first-class coaches.
1516,Amy,i’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. work with me.
1520,Amy,see if you guys can guess this one. bang. splat. thud.
1526,Amy,"oh, give it a rest."
1535,Amy,really? i do.
1537,Amy,yeah. you actually do have room for one up there.
1541,Amy,"all the time. and he knew that, as your girlfriend, i wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. i mean, a table? come on?"
1542,Amy,"well, thankfully, i won’t have to see it, ’cause i won’t be your girlfriend anymore. amy farrah fowler. why, yes, i would like to take a survey."
1546,Amy,which you also figured out by yourself.
1547,Amy,which is stronger than ever.
1548,Amy,you don’t need to explain yourself to him.
1551,Amy,rajesh?
1570,Amy,"well, what would i say to her?"
1573,Amy,and i’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
1579,Amy,"look, i admit that it’s odd that rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. as a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
1580,Amy,are we still going to go to that chaucer reading friday?
1582,Amy,"oh, hi."
1583,Amy,i don’t know.
1590,Amy,that is so sweet.
1591,Amy,what’s it for?
1604,Amy,"oh, my gosh."
1605,Amy,"no. no, it was a mistake."
1606,Amy,now i think you’re flirting with the line. good news?
1615,Amy,why would they still be using ddr3? are they nuts?
1626,Amy,you were just a little kid.
1631,Amy,then i’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
1635,Amy,could have given it back to me. that was a choice.
1644,Amy,how does that happen?
1646,Amy,that’s what i’m saying.
1651,Amy,and you don’t feel guilty about it?
1652,Amy,"i know, it’s weird, right?"
1655,Amy,"a psychic? he considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
1657,Amy,"can i confess something? once in a while, i get a little jealous of how close penny and sheldon are."
1661,Amy,"well, i was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, i wanted to make it up to you."
1665,Amy,are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
1668,Amy,"no, it combines two of sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
1670,Amy,i wonder why that is.
1671,Amy,did you ever watch professor proton when you were a kid?
1672,Amy,"i never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that sheldon got interested in science."
1680,Amy,"sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. she got hurt."
1682,Amy,how many is that now?
1685,Amy,"well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
1689,Amy,you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
1694,Amy,"hi, is sheldon here?"
1702,Amy,actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
1703,Amy,how could you let him go?
1706,Amy,"what do you mean, why did i come? you’re my boyfriend. i haven’t seen you in over a month. i just drove six hours to help you out. don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
1708,Amy,have you not noticed that i’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
1712,Amy,you were worried about that?
1723,Amy,"well, i think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
1725,Amy,"okay, so no bernadette."
1735,Amy,"if she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
1756,Amy,"it’s a good thing i’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire."
1760,Amy,sheldon and i got an eight-point-two out of ten.
1765,Amy,"i’ll tell you what. if we stay, i’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
1770,Amy,you really went your entire life without anyone saying i hate you to your face?
1774,Amy,you’re right. cheers.
1776,Amy,shh. amy’s here now.
1778,Amy,"i’m feeling a little backed into a corner, sheldon."
1783,Amy,ooh. there’s a cover band in the lounge.
1787,Amy,what if we don’t want to vomit?
1791,Amy,"so, um, now that penny’s not coming…"
1792,Amy,okay.
1794,Amy,"look at us out, while penny’s in the room studying."
1795,Amy,it is. but enough about penny. let’s talk about us. we’re looking good.
1803,Amy,"hey, penny, hey, let’s go. we found a place that has australian male strippers."
1808,Amy,"you know when you bend over, i can see down your shirt?"
1811,Amy,save you first; come back for raj only if there’s time.
1814,Amy,"okay, just checking."
1819,Amy,i’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
1828,Amy,i sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
1830,Amy,"well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so amy saves the day."
1838,Amy,"well, i hope you get it."
1851,Amy,"okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. stop bragging."
1861,Amy,what pressure? all i said was you look handsome. can you please open the door?
1863,Amy,you did?
1874,Amy,did they figure out what’s wrong?
1878,Amy,it’s nice they’re getting exercise.
1887,Amy,"he wore me down. and i was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
1890,Amy,who told you to keep going around?
1895,Amy,don’t be like that. you two need to talk this out.
1897,Amy,i know i was thinking that. is this a show on flags or mind reading?
1916,Amy,you’re going.
1931,Amy,okay. the next game is called hot boiled beans.
1932,Amy,"one person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
1934,Amy,i will literally race you to the car.
1937,Amy,"i actually can’t. my hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. i rode a very thin pony once. on the first bump, just popped right off."
1939,Amy,i actually can’t go ice-skating. i have unnaturally brittle ankles.
1940,Amy,"ooh, the philharmonic is playing beethoven downtown."
1942,Amy,what do you say? sounds kind of perfect.
1943,Amy,you guys comfy? this might take a while.
1946,Amy,"yeah, but it’s okay."
1949,Amy,basket weaving at the craft museum.
1954,Amy,it also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
1955,Amy,"all right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
1961,Amy,"look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
1963,Amy,that would be so romantic for you and leonard.
1966,Amy,"you’ve been working so much lately, i’m glad you didn’t forget about date night."
1968,Amy,maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
1969,Amy,fine. how was your day?
1973,Amy,"sheldon, stop it, i’m not kidding. take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
1975,Amy,that’s not true.
1976,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
1993,Amy,no.
2000,Amy,"fine. as cooper prepared to depart, tears filled amelia’s eyes. he took her hand in his and said, “i can’t stay, but i will never forget you.” he brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “please don’t go,” she whispered. but it was too late. the engine hummed to life."
2001,Amy,"she turned away, wiping her eyes. she couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. it was cooper."
2009,Amy,"i did. you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
2017,Amy,"so what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
2020,Amy,"well, except barnabas, but he was on adderall."
2024,Amy,i just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
2044,Amy,"well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
2047,Amy,let’s say it together.
6145,Bernadette,"hi. i’m bernadette maryann rostenkowski from yorba linda, california."
4100,Bernadette,my god! i thought you were my friend. 
6149,Bernadette,"i changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
4102,Bernadette,howie?
6150,Bernadette,the only thing i hate more than you right now is that book.
6151,Bernadette,howard!
4105,Bernadette,is there anything else about your past i should know?
6152,Bernadette,"okay. thanks, daddy. he said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
6154,Bernadette,hello?
6157,Bernadette,how’s she doing?
4112,Bernadette,what happened? i thought they cancelled your mission.
4115,Bernadette,wait. i don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
4118,Bernadette,i’ll talk to him. he won’t say no to his little girl.
4119,Bernadette,"but, howie, my dad can be a bully. he’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
4121,Bernadette,give me those damn pringles.
4122,Bernadette,"come on, howard. i’m not falling for that again."
4124,Bernadette,"oh, my god."
4127,Bernadette,i want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
4132,Bernadette,seriously? you’re going to wear that thing to city hall?
4138,Bernadette,are any of them still married?
4148,Bernadette,"oh, my god, it’s happening."
4155,Bernadette,do i look like i feel better?
4163,Bernadette,"so, you actually see you and sheldon getting married someday?"
4166,Bernadette,but do you think you’ll ever get married?
4167,Bernadette,it doesn’t sound like it.
4168,Bernadette,do you tell him that?
4171,Bernadette,"oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. i’m basically married to a sexy buzz lightyear."
4172,Bernadette,there’s my hubby. how’s everything going up there?
4176,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
4190,Bernadette,what’s wrong?
4192,Bernadette,"come on, howard. no one’s leaving you up there."
4196,Bernadette,"howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety."
4200,Bernadette,he’s coming back from outer space.
4223,Bernadette,of course you can. but maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
4229,Bernadette,"hey, i just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. i’m gonna be washing paint out of my smurf for a month."
4242,Bernadette,"so, i was taking a shower this morning, and when i got out, i started to dry off with what i thought was a towel but turned out to be howard’s mom’s underwear. i had to take another shower. it wasn’t enough. nothing will ever be enough."
4244,Bernadette,i got it.
6136,Bernadette,"cinnamon. where are you, my little lamb chop?"
4260,Bernadette,thank you.
4263,Bernadette,"so, is there anything i can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
4270,Bernadette,that’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
4277,Bernadette,really? only five?
4282,Bernadette,"you’re right. and i’m sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science."
4286,Bernadette,"what can i tell ya? she’s a big girl. wherever you look, there she is. more coffee?"
4317,Bernadette,"i don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
4320,Bernadette,"sorry, raj, it’s girls’ night out."
4321,Bernadette,no!
4328,Bernadette,jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
4329,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, raj."
4333,Bernadette,who’s involved?
4341,Bernadette,"i don’t mind it. i think howie’s just in touch with his inner child. although when he comes to bed in his batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like i’m touching his inner child."
4342,Bernadette,i’ve never even read a comic book. you guys?
4345,Bernadette,why are they staring?
4351,Bernadette,"i don’t think it’s heavy. it’s some sort of magic, so only thor can lift it."
4353,Bernadette,let’s read it again.
4354,Bernadette,you want some tea?
4360,Bernadette,"oh, my god. that’s so cute. i didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you."
4363,Bernadette,how?
4365,Bernadette,"at any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?"
4369,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
4370,Bernadette,those chinese acrobats in cirque du soleil made it look so easy.
4376,Bernadette,"i’ve been working late every night. all i asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. but did he do it? no. he just kept on playing that stupid game. you like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine."
4388,Bernadette,"oh, you poor baby."
4404,Bernadette,come at me. see what happens.
4407,Bernadette,what you doing?
4417,Bernadette,"sheldon, i’ve been cooking all day."
4421,Bernadette,"howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?"
4422,Bernadette,"howie, you okay?"
4423,Bernadette,"told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. i know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it."
4426,Bernadette,why don’t you read it? maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
4429,Bernadette,feel better?
4440,Bernadette,that’s nice.
4459,Bernadette,"yeah. i never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, i felt like maybe someday we could do it."
4461,Bernadette,"well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
4469,Bernadette,it’s fine. where’d you get that picture of her?
4470,Bernadette,"oh, thank god she’s okay."
4473,Bernadette,"don’t well me, mister. we’ve been worried sick. she could have been dead for all we knew. you should be ashamed of yourself."
4480,Bernadette,"long story short, she’s on the no fly list and we might have been followed here by a drone."
4491,Bernadette,"the hotel’s nice. there’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. "
4498,Bernadette,it’s fine. i thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
4499,Bernadette,"yes, it’s all cool. although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
4516,Bernadette,let me see. how long have you been putting this on her?
4520,Bernadette,it’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
4524,Bernadette,should we just do couples?
4538,Bernadette,because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. 
4539,Bernadette,how do i put this? she’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. or a cat. or a willow.
4543,Bernadette,"great, climb back up. come on."
4544,Bernadette,let’s go.
4545,Bernadette,they’re here first. this is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
4547,Bernadette,"because you were about to quit like a big, sheldon, cover your ears."
4549,Bernadette,maybe the spot’s the clue.
4566,Bernadette,well?
4567,Bernadette,what exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
4575,Bernadette,"it’s not? you spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. last week, you two got a couples massage. so, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
4578,Bernadette,great news. a raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
4579,Bernadette,"in the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
4587,Bernadette,"howie, stop. come on, look at what i’m making."
4589,Bernadette,hi.
4591,Bernadette,maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
4595,Bernadette,that’s lucy?
4605,Bernadette,sure.
4611,Bernadette,i guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
4621,Bernadette,how’s it going out there?
4623,Bernadette,so why don’t you do that with them?
4625,Bernadette,"sorry. i really want to hear how sad you are. i’ll be back in like five, ten minutes."
4626,Bernadette,"hey. howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. now, both of you apologize right now."
4631,Bernadette,howie. 
4652,Bernadette,"yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
4655,Bernadette,"good idea, i’ll take a picture."
4664,Bernadette,"hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
4670,Bernadette,"well, stuart’s cute in his own way."
4671,Bernadette,or maybe just stop talking.
4673,Bernadette,what happened?
4677,Bernadette,"no, of course not."
4682,Bernadette,sorry. did i startle you?
4683,Bernadette,"well, i need a little help. i accidentally destroyed one of howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping i could replace it."
4688,Bernadette,"you know, i do work at a pharmaceutical company. if you can make this happen today, i can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. "
4689,Bernadette,"oh, that’s great."
4692,Bernadette,wow.
4694,Bernadette,hey.
4697,Bernadette,"yes, i am, there’s a few more things i want to say to you. stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, i’d like to buy it right now."
4699,Bernadette,"well, that sounds even better."
4710,Bernadette,"well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
4712,Bernadette,i’m gonna fix this right now.
4714,Bernadette,great. now there’s two of ’em.
4717,Bernadette,"so, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. most of them are. i mean, look at this guy. you think he came like this? when i met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. now, he’s been to space. that’s all me."
4728,Bernadette,"wow. well, what did you say?"
4744,Bernadette,"no, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups."
4759,Bernadette,"hi, stuart."
4760,Bernadette,"well, i told howie if i wasn’t busy, i’d spend the night at his mom’s. so for god’s sake, think of something."
4764,Bernadette,what do you care? you’re dead.
4766,Bernadette,i didn’t know you were fat.
4770,Bernadette,so i guess you two are making it work long distance.
4773,Bernadette,"penny did it, i win. suck it, jackasses."
4780,Bernadette,but no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what i was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
4784,Bernadette,am i a terrible person?
4785,Bernadette,am i a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
4788,Bernadette,i like the wii.
4797,Bernadette,how?
4799,Bernadette,"emily, what do you do?"
4804,Bernadette,"you’re kidding, right?"
4807,Bernadette,how’s your soup?
4808,Bernadette,where are you going?
4827,Bernadette,we set it up in howie’s old room.
4828,Bernadette,maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
4829,Bernadette,howie.
4830,Bernadette,taking care of your own mother? how can you say that?
4831,Bernadette,i would do it for my mother.
4833,Bernadette,you’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? that’s so cruel.
4839,Bernadette,sorry.
4841,Bernadette,"so what? after two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
4843,Bernadette,i’m glad i got that mocha. and you know what else i’m glad about? i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car.
4848,Bernadette,you guys propose all the time. this never happens.
4851,Bernadette,but we have jobs. we can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
4852,Bernadette,"i wanted to go to hawaii, not hell."
4853,Bernadette,"howie, i love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, i want a divorce."
4859,Bernadette,i’ll pay you anything you want.
4860,Bernadette,i could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
4862,Bernadette,"yeah. i don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
4864,Bernadette,"don’t be. you are built for pharmaceutical sales. you’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
4866,Bernadette,"maybe. but like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. anyway, i talked you up to dan. he’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you."
4867,Bernadette,you’ll be fine. just be yourself.
4882,Bernadette,not tonight. i’m a little frustrated with her.
4884,Bernadette,"it’s driving me crazy. just this afternoon, i saw on instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
4888,Bernadette,"that sounds fun, but i promised penny i’d come by and help her study."
4897,Bernadette,i’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
4899,Bernadette,"great. and while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
4903,Bernadette,"okay, stop."
4911,Bernadette,i think so.
4918,Bernadette,"you know, penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. maybe she can practice on you some time."
4922,Bernadette,i’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
4926,Bernadette,and i’m sure you can turn it around.
4931,Bernadette,i know.
4933,Bernadette,nope.
4937,Bernadette,"oh, baby. that story’s made up, isn’t it?"
4938,Bernadette,"okay, let’s get down to business. howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, i have a few questions."
4939,Bernadette,"hell, yeah."
4943,Bernadette,you sure?
4959,Bernadette,aren’t you gonna chase her?
4960,Bernadette,see? isn’t this better than a hotel room?
4969,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy i felt that i should."
4974,Bernadette,was it more or less than falconry school?
4979,Bernadette,money’s a sensitive subject for howie because of the difference in our income.
4987,Bernadette,what would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
4991,Bernadette,"it was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
5007,Bernadette,how was your prom? did you go?
5011,Bernadette,"ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
5013,Bernadette,"look, even stuart’s bringing a date. i wonder who it is."
5015,Bernadette,i saw a picture of you two dancing together.
5021,Bernadette,that’s jeanie?
5026,Bernadette,"well, what are some of the things they like?"
5027,Bernadette,he said that to her?
5031,Bernadette,he’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. tough crowd.
5053,Bernadette,"oh, how is she?"
5055,Bernadette,"oh, yeah. i remember him from the picnic. he was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
5063,Bernadette,where? to babies r us?
5064,Bernadette,"okay, sorry. can we just go? i feel like everybody hates me."
5065,Bernadette,i think i’d rather go.
5066,Bernadette,thank you.
5080,Bernadette,it’s not okay. how can i even work here anymore?
5081,Bernadette,i can’t let you do that.
5082,Bernadette,i guess that would be all right.
5088,Bernadette,she’s just excited about the holidays.
5090,Bernadette,what?
5092,Bernadette,then you’re both sad?
5095,Bernadette,i think the nicest gifts i’ve got from howie show how well he knows me.
5098,Bernadette,you okay?
5102,Bernadette,"you know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens."
5121,Bernadette,please?
5125,Bernadette,"oh, amelia."
5127,Bernadette,i was just kidding. i’m sorry. and the story’s really good.
5128,Bernadette,please?
5134,Bernadette,"i know you don’t like stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, i’m sure he’ll get back on his feet."
5137,Bernadette,howie.
5140,Bernadette,"howie, if the store succeeds, stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
5143,Bernadette,you helped him?
5144,Bernadette,what?
5146,Bernadette,eight sixteen.
5148,Bernadette,"um, well, it’s, uh, black. there’s a red ribbon tied to the handle."
5150,Bernadette,"sure you don’t want to go home? when the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us."
5153,Bernadette,there’s no way you could’ve known. be right back. excuse me?
5157,Bernadette,okay. but you got a lot of receipts for the lego store in here.
5160,Bernadette,aw. i’m gonna miss her.
5164,Bernadette,not a chance.
5170,Bernadette,it’s okay. it’s just food.
5173,Bernadette,"there’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
5175,Bernadette,i love that.
5181,Bernadette,"yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before."
5188,Bernadette,i think you just answered your own question.
5195,Bernadette,"leonard makes you watch that, too?"
5197,Bernadette,"i don’t know much about doctor who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the tardis, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the tardis is bigger than the outside. but then again, i don’t know much about<i> doctor who."
5203,Bernadette,"don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
5216,Bernadette,"howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
5220,Bernadette,oh. how do you drink it?
5226,Bernadette,you’re being childish.
5229,Bernadette,i was kidding. of course you are.
5242,Bernadette,four hours of our lives gone? check.
5245,Bernadette,stuart.
5247,Bernadette,"guys. in the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, i got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
5249,Bernadette,"yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
5258,Bernadette,you know which yoghurt i mean.
5259,Bernadette,maybe raj is right. maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
5263,Bernadette,right.
5269,Bernadette,"so, anyway, what i’m trying to say is… "
5283,Bernadette,what will pay for itself?
5285,Bernadette,"i mean, if penny finds out i’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think i’m a terrible friend. i wish you never told me."
5287,Bernadette,"i don’t know what to think. but then again, i just found out about it."
5290,Bernadette,"oh, me neither, not until just now."
5291,Bernadette,"come on, leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. you sure we can’t take you to a strip club?"
5294,Bernadette,you guys still aren’t living together?
5302,Bernadette,this party’s weird.
5308,Bernadette,"that’s a joke, right?"
5310,Bernadette,it’s understandable. amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon.
5316,Bernadette,aw. i’m honoured.
5331,Bernadette,stuart took that rejection like a pro.
5337,Bernadette,are you attracted to him?
5338,Bernadette,yeah.
5342,Bernadette,"hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? stuart."
5344,Bernadette,he’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
5357,Bernadette,and how many guys have you gone out with?
5361,Bernadette,"look, i get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but i want this to feel like my house, too."
5364,Bernadette,whatcha doing?
5369,Bernadette,fine. then the dining room.
5374,Bernadette,aftershock.
5375,Bernadette,so i should probably explain why i kind of fibbed.
5384,Bernadette,"ooh, tall. finally some details about this mystery man."
5386,Bernadette,tea and basketball?
5391,Bernadette,"across the street, in the left window."
5395,Bernadette,"he’s cute, right?"
5396,Bernadette,"yeah, i should’ve brought my parabolic microphone."
5398,Bernadette,i took a video. i forgot how much fun this is.
5401,Bernadette,right here.
5413,Bernadette,"oh, great. we’d love to help."
5415,Bernadette,what difference does it make?
5419,Bernadette,but he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves sheldon.
5425,Bernadette,who’s trent?
5427,Bernadette,you mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
5430,Bernadette,"what happens if i say, come in?"
5432,Bernadette,just come in.
5439,Bernadette,"great. and then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
5443,Bernadette,do you think sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
5450,Bernadette,great. i can finally show you where the laundry room is.
5457,Bernadette,"boy, when was the last time stuart cleaned this place?"
5459,Bernadette,why can’t it be a woman cave?
5462,Bernadette,"yeah. you know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
5473,Bernadette,and he made it all better.
5474,Bernadette,you know what that means.
5480,Bernadette,"not you. i own your ass. the real question is, where are you with emily?"
5484,Bernadette,"well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause i love how things worked out."
5485,Bernadette,made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
5488,Bernadette,are you gonna tell emily?
5490,Bernadette,"look at that, you shaved it all."
5491,Bernadette,"ew, really? get it out."
5492,Bernadette,"uh, wish we had a skimmer."
5505,Bernadette,"if you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested."
5506,Bernadette,"oh, cut off his head? that’s where his little nose is."
5508,Bernadette,we’ll find another time to tell him i’m pregnant.
5510,Bernadette,i don’t know. maybe it says something on the back.
3473,Bernadette,that works.
3475,Bernadette,"oh, raj, you’re our guest."
3476,Bernadette,"yeah, exciting. can i ask you something?"
5523,Bernadette,"you’re probably right. after we talked about it, he started to calm down."
5526,Bernadette,doctor said i can’t have sushi.
3480,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5530,Bernadette,"no, i’m embarrassed."
5531,Bernadette,"fine. we were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
5534,Bernadette,"i was headed to the bathroom, and i passed howie on his way out. usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here."
3491,Bernadette,"oh, yeah? does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?"
5540,Bernadette,"it’s okay to be nervous. i am, too."
3493,Bernadette,no. that’s the sad part.
3495,Bernadette,not on a bicycle. in a camry.
3498,Bernadette,why?
5547,Bernadette,"i can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, sheldon."
3500,Bernadette,i don’t really get it.
5549,Bernadette,"yeah. the other day i sniffed out where howie hid the girl scout cookies. no more tagalongs, my ass."
3507,Bernadette,but i need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
3509,Bernadette,call me when you figure it out.
3510,Bernadette,"hello, howard."
5559,Bernadette,what is it?
5560,Bernadette,"so, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
3520,Bernadette,are you kidding? that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
5575,Bernadette,i’m kind of getting into the groove here.
3528,Bernadette,"don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
3532,Bernadette,that’s amazing.
5580,Bernadette,what’s going on?
3534,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, show me. in microbiology, the most exciting thing i get to work with is yeast."
3545,Bernadette,it unhooks in the front.
3553,Bernadette,"no, you didn’t. you said leonard’s experiment was stupid."
5606,Bernadette,yeah.
3562,Bernadette,"so, what should we talk about?"
3565,Bernadette,"oh, my god, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
5613,Bernadette,i’m not hearing anything.
3567,Bernadette,when howard tried to do the splits…
5614,Bernadette,"wait, that’s it."
5615,Bernadette,isn’t that the best?
3570,Bernadette,"okay, sheldon. what happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough rem sleep?"
5618,Bernadette,you guys have fun. i’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
3572,Bernadette,"right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
5623,Bernadette,"it’s okay, you should go."
3583,Bernadette,too bad.
3585,Bernadette,i’m okay.
3590,Bernadette,does that mean slutty trolls?
5640,Bernadette,all right.
5645,Bernadette,"i storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
5647,Bernadette,i stab it in the middle eye.
3603,Bernadette,"oh, i take pacts very seriously. one time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. that day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed ebola with the common cold."
5651,Bernadette,"well, thanks again."
5655,Bernadette,"well, we don’t exactly. i’m a microbiologist for the research team."
5656,Bernadette,some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
3609,Bernadette,olive.
5659,Bernadette,"um, you should probably talk to penny, too."
5660,Bernadette,but we did get to see a live stream of it on the internet.
3613,Bernadette,you are?
3615,Bernadette,or we could just stay here.
5670,Bernadette,you’re being ridiculous.
3623,Bernadette,"okay, my turn. penny, truth or dare?"
3624,Bernadette,why are you still hanging out with leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
3625,Bernadette,yeah.
5671,Bernadette,"it’s probably just a coincidence. speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
5675,Bernadette,"yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house."
3628,Bernadette,"ooh, like what?"
3629,Bernadette,where exactly on the internet have you been looking?
3630,Bernadette,i might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
3632,Bernadette,so where’s the telescope?
5682,Bernadette,anybody have anything snarky to say about that? didn’t think so.
3635,Bernadette,"hold on. wait. no, it’s okay, go ahead."
3637,Bernadette,"it won’t help. once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
3642,Bernadette,"well, live and learn. so, raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
5690,Bernadette,"i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus. she might have heard me throwing up one morning. every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
3644,Bernadette,"he’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?"
3645,Bernadette,"oh, you poor, poor thing. raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. there are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you."
3650,Bernadette,he’s really cute. how do you know him?
5699,Bernadette,fell asleep?
5704,Bernadette,why did you do that?
5709,Bernadette,"are you kidding? i’ve always been treated differently. look at me. listen to me. i mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s i wonder if her mommy"
5710,Bernadette,"i’ve worked so hard to get where i am, and i don’t want to get sent back to square one because i’m pregnant."
5711,Bernadette,thank you.
5713,Bernadette,apple slices? what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald’s and gets fruit?
3666,Bernadette,bye.
5716,Bernadette,i just wanted to apologize. i know what you did was an accident.
3669,Bernadette,"then we went out for a year. come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap."
5723,Bernadette,you shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
3680,Bernadette,can i stay here tonight?
3681,Bernadette,howard’s a complete and total ass.
3683,Bernadette,"sure. i think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. it’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. as a microbiologist, i can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
5734,Bernadette,"this was the husband and this was the wife. they’d go out on adventures together. cruises, skiing, horseback riding. that was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
5737,Bernadette,sorry i flipped out on you. i think it’s just hormones.
5744,Bernadette,"raj, why don’t i care about anything?"
3706,Bernadette,stay.
3707,Bernadette,go home.
3709,Bernadette,"no, i mean just you and me. you can move in here, or we can find a place."
3710,Bernadette,what?
5759,Bernadette,we don’t want you to know.
5760,Bernadette,"this is ridiculous. the doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, raj knows, his grey’s anatomy online fan group probably knows. is it weird we don’t?"
3714,Bernadette,"no, it’s not great. you need to make a choice. me or your mother."
5766,Bernadette,wait.
5767,Bernadette,next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
5769,Bernadette,"keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
3723,Bernadette,i can’t believe we’re finally living together.
5771,Bernadette,you’re so weird.
3726,Bernadette,okay.
5774,Bernadette,"lock the door, lock the door."
5778,Bernadette,"let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny."
3731,Bernadette,i can’t believe this.
3732,Bernadette,"all right, howard, let’s get something straight right now. i’m not going to be your mother."
3736,Bernadette,sure.
3737,Bernadette,we were hoping you’d know a place.
5784,Bernadette,is someone else here?
5793,Bernadette,which mit did you go to?
3751,Bernadette,"oh, hey, raj, what are you doing here?"
5800,Bernadette,fine.
3754,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
5802,Bernadette,i don’t want to drive that. it’s such a mom car.
5803,Bernadette,"they thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
5807,Bernadette,do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? they’re just gonna give you ice and advil like last time.
5812,Bernadette,"actually, it’s been ready for weeks."
3767,Bernadette,"oh, i totally want to see sheldon dance. i bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
3768,Bernadette,"well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
3772,Bernadette,some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
5820,Bernadette,"great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
3782,Bernadette,she’s also dating an astronaut.
3783,Bernadette,"yeah. but leonard’s impressive, too."
5832,Bernadette,i can’t imagine you being violent.
3787,Bernadette,"you’ve met lots of astronauts, and i’ve never grilled you about that. i’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
5839,Bernadette,"thank you, but i’m not really sure."
3793,Bernadette,i suppose i could get them back to talking about leonard going to india to meet priya’s parents.
3795,Bernadette,i don’t know. i was too busy covering my heinie on amy’s stupid astronaut story!
3796,Bernadette,you texted me penny’s dating an astronaut.
5843,Bernadette,howard just did that.
5844,Bernadette,"stuart, you cooked?"
5849,Bernadette,"do something, batman."
5851,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
3809,Bernadette,i know. but if she orders something low-fat i’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
5858,Bernadette,here comes another contraction.
5864,Bernadette,how could you?
5868,Bernadette,we could name her after your mom.
5870,Bernadette,let’s keep thinking.
3824,Bernadette,me? why me?
5873,Bernadette,"i didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a milky way or a snickers girl?"
5875,Bernadette,"no. if one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, i’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
3833,Bernadette,"well, you’ll be really be proud of this. i was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. they’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
3838,Bernadette,what the hell is wrong with you?
5888,Bernadette,"no they’re not, you bozo. how come stuart can get her to stop crying, but i can’t?"
3845,Bernadette,that’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
5893,Bernadette,"thank you, sheldon, i’m feeling better now."
3847,Bernadette,is she moving out?
5897,Bernadette,i didn’t know what else to do. it worked.
3851,Bernadette,take me home now.
3853,Bernadette,and your mom would be okay with that?
5902,Bernadette,"we love you, too."
3855,Bernadette,"i’m okay, mrs. wolowitz."
5905,Bernadette,things going well with you and sheldon living together?
3859,Bernadette,"no, it’s not. i’m not going in there."
5907,Bernadette,"uh oh, what’s going on?"
3861,Bernadette,it’s me.
5915,Bernadette,i like the first one.
5918,Bernadette,"you’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
3872,Bernadette,hang on a second. nasa doesn’t have a shuttle any more. how are you going to get up there?
5927,Bernadette,"we will. got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. let’s party."
5942,Bernadette,"and leonard loves you so much, he married you twice. "
5944,Bernadette,and there they go.
5945,Bernadette,"oh, it’s okay. it’s good to get out of the house."
3899,Bernadette,can we talk?
5947,Bernadette,"oh, i’m sure that’s not true."
3901,Bernadette,i know. i’m sorry. i got scared.
5950,Bernadette,"oh, my god, you really are spoiled."
3903,Bernadette,really? you got seasick on pirates of the caribbean.
3905,Bernadette,you’re my soul mate. this is where you kiss me.
3906,Bernadette,"hi, sheldon."
5956,Bernadette,making lasagna.
3909,Bernadette,"this is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
3913,Bernadette,"well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
5963,Bernadette,"you said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
3916,Bernadette,i don’t know. dead people’s dresses?
3920,Bernadette,"she keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
5969,Bernadette,there she goes.
3924,Bernadette,"yes, absolutely fine."
5973,Bernadette,kinda. 
5975,Bernadette,it’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of halley you’ve done.
5976,Bernadette,and you live here for free.
5979,Bernadette,you just don’t want to go alone with sheldon.
3935,Bernadette,i love it!
3936,Bernadette,"oh, amy! looking sexy!"
5985,Bernadette,that sounds awful.
5989,Bernadette,"you know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
3943,Bernadette,i still think he looks like someone’s pet. maybe we should put up posters.
3944,Bernadette,i didn’t have any.
5993,Bernadette,"well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
5995,Bernadette,"look, raj just gets along with women. "
3951,Bernadette,i love this dress. how come i never see you wear it?
6001,Bernadette,hey.
6008,Bernadette,and that day care is great.
6011,Bernadette,"don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
3967,Bernadette,"god, they’re cute. oh, why did they have to be cute?"
6019,Bernadette,fine.
6020,Bernadette,"love you, too."
6021,Bernadette,"okay, you won. can i finish what i’m doing?"
3974,Bernadette,"oh, ah, right.  and now, the great howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
3975,Bernadette,after you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
6024,Bernadette,"no, what is wrong with you?"
6027,Bernadette,it was?
3980,Bernadette,not him.
3985,Bernadette,"right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and i’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
6035,Bernadette,"well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. i’m going back to work after only four months, so i’ve learned i hate myself, i hate sloths, and i hate you for bringing me here."
6038,Bernadette,"no, i’ll be fine. "
6040,Bernadette,"well, guess i’m ready to go."
6042,Bernadette,"okay. okay, sweetie, mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
6045,Bernadette,"i see a wall, floor, some asian baby, there she is."
4003,Bernadette,"you can make-believe, though. sometimes howard and i pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and i’m a sexy cardiologist. and the naughty part is i’m not in his hmo network."
4008,Bernadette,i’m a very vengeful person.
6056,Bernadette,is it i’m going to die alone?
6060,Bernadette,i wouldn’t trust her. he’s thin and sexy like a jewish greyhound.
4013,Bernadette,what about me and howard?
4014,Bernadette,where are you guys going to eat?
4017,Bernadette,oh. is that cute or creepy?
4018,Bernadette,i don’t know if i want to stay.
4022,Bernadette,you mean my special day?
6074,Bernadette,so what happens next?
4028,Bernadette,are you mad at me?
4031,Bernadette,"really? oh, that’d be so great."
6079,Bernadette,want me to put on some neil diamond? that always makes you feel better.
6082,Bernadette,really? he doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
6087,Bernadette,you have to go.
6088,Bernadette,"i’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
6096,Bernadette,i signed us up for ballroom dance class.
4049,Bernadette,you threw up?
4057,Bernadette,are you crying?
6108,Bernadette,"that’s ridiculous. as far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
6109,Bernadette,"yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot raj down."
4063,Bernadette,get that guy! get that guy! pew! pew! pew! pew!
6114,Bernadette,excuse me.
6115,Bernadette,let me just put that on vibrate.
6123,Bernadette,he didn’t try them yet!
4080,Bernadette,"oh, my god, that’s terrible."
4088,Bernadette,i’ve actually been thinking i’m going to hyphenate: bernadette mary-ann rostenkowski-wolowitz.
6137,Bernadette,"howie, stop. i can’t talk like that. amy’s right here."
4090,Bernadette,funny. you boys have a nice time?
6140,Bernadette,"yeah, honey, i’m still stuck at work. really? penny said that? okay, it’s true. i’m sorry. i’ll see you at home. yeah, yeah, i’ll put it on."
10241,Howard,what? you’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
8195,Howard,"better put it on the list. if you wash my underwear with regular soap, i get little red bumps on my tuchus."
10246,Howard,"yep, i wish stuart would reopen. i hate this place, too."
10249,Howard,that does sound fun.
8202,Howard,didn’t you read my email?
8205,Howard,"oh, please. that crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
10255,Howard,"hey, what difference does it make? you’re the one she wants to marry."
8209,Howard,i think it’s like beetlejuice. we said his name too many times.
10257,Howard,he’s right.
6166,Howard,and you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
6170,Howard,it’s french for good shower. it’s a sentiment i can express in six languages.
10266,Howard,that’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
6172,Howard,"oh, he speaks english, he just can’t speak to women."
10268,Howard,i’m always welcome.
10272,Howard,"probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
8225,Howard,"i’m saying believe in magic, you muggle."
8226,Howard,and was your card the jack of diamonds?
6180,Howard,.
8233,Howard,"that’s pathetic. let me show you how a real magician does it. raj, take a card. don’t let me see it."
8234,Howard,three of clubs. 
10282,Howard,oh. i never saw that.
10285,Howard,also mine.
8238,Howard,hey!
6191,Howard,"hold on, honey, men at work. the pvc comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
6192,Howard,"perfect, leonard, why don’t you and sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, raj and i will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
10288,Howard,we got to watch back to the future ii.
8242,Howard,all right. . two of hearts.
6196,Howard,"raj, blow up the gates."
8246,Howard,"all right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
8247,Howard,maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
6202,Howard,sounds like your neighbour’s home.
6203,Howard,"stealing snail mail, very old school, i like it. "
8253,Howard,"yeah. no one can hide from me, not waldo, not carmen san diego, not even topless natalie portman."
6208,Howard,"i don’t know, you guys work in the same lab."
6209,Howard,"there are pitfalls, trust me, i know. when it comes to sexual harassment law i’m… a bit of a self-taught expert. "
10308,Howard,not a lot.
10310,Howard,"for the tenth time, that was a groupon."
10311,Howard,talk about wasted money. what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
10312,Howard,"oh, you’re saying i don’t do anything around here. look at my chore chart."
6217,Howard,"well, as usual, wolowitz has the solution. i happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and leonard could have his pick."
8267,Howard,why did you bring that?
8269,Howard,19th-century technology.
6223,Howard,"hey, look who’s come out…."
6224,Howard,"not so fast, remember the south still has two infantry divisions, plus superman and godzilla."
10326,Howard,stick your head in there and find out.
6232,Howard,"hey, look, it’s doctor stud!"
8281,Howard,you will?
10329,Howard,"yeah, that was very uncool. get the hammer. get the hammer."
6236,Howard,"yes, but you don’t have to lose to kyle bernstein’s bar-mitzvah party. "
10338,Howard,she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
8292,Howard,sure.
10341,Howard,you know exactly who it is. he’s gonna bring my mom. why did you even invite him?
8294,Howard,"okay, well, it’s getting late. this was terrific. you win. bernie?"
10344,Howard,"stuart, we have to talk. this thing with you and my mom, i hate it. it’s making me crazy. you and i were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party i’m going to? what the hell?"
8302,Howard,troll master.
6258,Howard,no.
8308,Howard,"no, i mean lunch, today, with bernadette."
10363,Howard,you don’t look okay.
10366,Howard,"so, how you doing?"
10367,Howard,why? your father barely speaks to your mother.
6274,Howard,"who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept!"
8323,Howard,you can’t take that personally.
6276,Howard,"yay! if you’ll excuse me, i have some bar-mizvah bonds to cash. "
8325,Howard,"well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
10371,Howard,how can i convince you it won’t?
8327,Howard,"bernie, it’s not you. she’s just set in her ways."
10375,Howard,"okay, okay. i really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel."
10376,Howard,"i just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. although, there are ways to improve our communication. one thing i learned when i was in couples therapy was…"
8330,Howard,"sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. i’m not taking you home."
8332,Howard,is she okay?
6285,Howard,"me too. of course, it speaks to me culturally. "
6287,Howard,so who wants to rent fiddler?
10384,Howard,i love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
6290,Howard,"don’t worry, you’ll thank me.  you may now thank me. "
8338,Howard,yeah. do you?
8339,Howard,and are you?
8340,Howard,"well, based on the available evid…"
6294,Howard,"no, no, let’s see how long it takes him."
8341,Howard,where are you going?
6296,Howard,"i’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. "
6297,Howard,"oh, yeah, i tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. "
8345,Howard,uh..
8347,Howard,"congratulations, honey."
10388,Howard,"makes you think. oh, well."
10390,Howard,"oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. i dated it all through sixth grade."
10395,Howard,mmm. it’s just columns of random numbers. toss it.
10396,Howard,"well, there’s no discernible pattern that i can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check."
10398,Howard,"ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. we could start with basic cryptanalysis."
10400,Howard,"yeah, i’m not even sure if it’s the right word."
10404,Howard,"i guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
6309,Howard,"i don’t know, sheldon, those topical conferences on bowes-einstein condensates parties are legendary. "
10405,Howard,"yeah for you, not for me. i went to space. i’m covered."
10407,Howard,"oh, yeah."
10409,Howard,i agree.
10411,Howard,"i know. if we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty."
8373,Howard,i don’t see anything.
6328,Howard,"i know it’s the phone, ma, i hear the phone."
8376,Howard,"let it go, sheldon. i’ll get you a jamba juice on the way home."
8379,Howard,"pretty sweet, huh? this little baby set the university back 175 grand."
10427,Howard,you know what i think your problem is? you’re jealous because you and i used to be best friends until koothrappali came along.
8382,Howard,thank you. how’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
10431,Howard,"well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out."
6336,Howard,"hang on, call waiting."
6337,Howard,hello.
8384,Howard,"you know, the virtual pickle tickle. the digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
8387,Howard,"well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with kama sutra coloring books."
6340,Howard,"stand by. ma, can my friends come over?"
6341,Howard,that’s a negatory. but there’s a planet of the apes marathon at the new art today. 
8388,Howard,"oh, come on, tell me i’m wrong."
10438,Howard,"uh, maybe it’s just stunned."
6348,Howard,i’m not going in there.
8397,Howard,check it out. free chair.
6350,Howard,"one more thing. this is a subsonic impact sensor. if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. at that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
10451,Howard,"nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
6360,Howard,"hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your head back.  "
10457,Howard,"so, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
8412,Howard,"yeah, well, i’m sorry i didn’t run it by you first."
10466,Howard,"yeah, but you’re a scientist."
6372,Howard,go away. 
8421,Howard,"oh. yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. hang on. ma, give up! tonight’s not your night!"
6375,Howard,then our problem would be solved. 
10474,Howard,like am i dressed okay?
10476,Howard,that’s nice.
8430,Howard,oh.
8431,Howard,i don’t need any butter.
6389,Howard,"interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. "
8437,Howard,"eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
10488,Howard,"well, i don’t think that’s gonna help at all."
10490,Howard,nah.
8444,Howard,maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
6397,Howard,"ooh, more details about the new star trek film. there’s going to be a scene depicting spock’s birth. "
6401,Howard,recognise. 
10499,Howard,"well, um, we were just kidding around."
6410,Howard,some of us might have the correct answers too. 
6412,Howard,okay. 
8462,Howard,you? i made you smooth. you were an idiot.
6417,Howard,"okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
8465,Howard,why are you still doing this?
8466,Howard,here’s some other fun news on the raj/emily front. he gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
10231,Howard,"well, maybe i’ll do a good job."
10518,Howard,"well, i’m her son, and i say it’s not okay."
8474,Howard,"she says, sure, what about him?"
6427,Howard,it looks like something they found on the ship at roswell. 
8476,Howard,try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
10522,Howard,that is a good point. but i didn’t marry you for good points. i married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous i’m being.
6430,Howard,a time machine from the movie the time machine? 
6432,Howard,do you have $800?
6433,Howard,"don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping."
8480,Howard,"it’s me, sheldon. it’s me. i’m going up in space! technically, i’m an astronaut."
6435,Howard,why don’t we share it? we’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.
10531,Howard,"all right, fine. where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? the first, well,"
6438,Howard,"not necessary, i have a masters in engineering, i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. when the mars rover started pulling to the left i performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  no, that baby’s broken. "
8488,Howard,honestly? sex.
6444,Howard,"lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
8492,Howard,"hey, we’re a team. so, what do you think?"
6446,Howard,"screw his balcony, i’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage. "
8493,Howard,no?
8494,Howard,well why not?
8496,Howard,"change your mind about sex? i’m still mad, but i’ll do it."
10540,Howard,ma? i’m sorry i didn’t take you to the airport. i just want you to know that i’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. and i promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
10541,Howard,how are the taxes going?
10547,Howard,so?
8502,Howard,"i don’t know. if we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that i’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
8503,Howard,obviously.
6456,Howard,"i know, i’m disgusting, i should be punished. by her, oh look, i did it again. "
10550,Howard,"you know what, you sound busy, i’m gonna let you go."
10555,Howard,great. neither of those. try a hammer.
8509,Howard,"well, those big kids were rocking it."
6462,Howard,"destiny, thy name is anaheim. "
8511,Howard,"right, right."
10557,Howard,in emily’s eyes.
10561,Howard,thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
8515,Howard,what do you say?
6471,Howard,bye missy.
6472,Howard,"okay, you two have to back off."
8520,Howard,"come on, admit it. we got you, sheldon."
10568,Howard,it’s all defrosting.
10573,Howard,okay. then how about this? let’s invite everyone over to dinner. it’ll be like ma’s feeding us one last time.
6479,Howard,"is it ‘cause i’m jewish, ‘cause i’d kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
6480,Howard,"look, we have to settle this."
6481,Howard,"oh, you poor, deluded bastard. "
8531,Howard,that’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
10580,Howard,no. i want to do this.
8533,Howard,oy. bernadette keeps texting me pictures of penny in bridesmaid dresses.
10584,Howard,"good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
6490,Howard,"well i love birthdays, waking up to mom’s special french toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
8538,Howard,what do you want us to do about it?
6492,Howard,"you think? go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. "
10589,Howard,you guys ever notice sometimes bernadette sounds like my mom?
6494,Howard,"i suppose that’s possible, but for the record, i’ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one."
6495,Howard,"fine. if i do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. i’m just kidding, yes you can. can you bring a friend? "
10592,Howard,excuse me. why is there a sticker on this? it’s my tardis from doctor who. i was planning on moving it in the house.
6497,Howard,can you just let us in.
8545,Howard,"all right, sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
10593,Howard,"come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what i paid for it."
10595,Howard,we’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
6501,Howard,too late.
6507,Howard,what if they’re women?
6508,Howard,how’s it going?
6510,Howard,"no, you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. they say it completely changes the tone of the film. "
6512,Howard,can’t you play him some other time?
10610,Howard,"one-zero. two. three. four. five-nothing. wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
6516,Howard,"i don’t know, it was just there."
6522,Howard,"no, see, the only way i could get him to leave is to tell him i ate a peanut. because i’m allergic to peanuts. "
8570,Howard,"little snarky there, cello lessons. and we have this completely ordinary cylinder. if you’d like to examine it?"
6524,Howard,yes.
8579,Howard,i just gave it to her!
8581,Howard,you’ll do fine. hand me those rings? see? you nailed it.
6535,Howard,thy will be done. 
10633,Howard,"i’m surprised you could hear me with this thin mint in your ear. yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
8586,Howard,"okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
10634,Howard,"well, i hope i get to see you again."
10635,Howard,"hey, i threw out the first pitch at an angels game."
10639,Howard,sure.
8594,Howard,"well, yeah."
8596,Howard,"yeah, she doesn’t like them. and from what i saw, the feeling was mutual."
6549,Howard,"not now, i have a blog to find. "
8597,Howard,"i don’t know. i can’t see a life where i don’t have kids. i mean, people have kids. i mean, even donkey kong had donkey kong jr. so he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at italian plumbers."
6551,Howard,"apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which i cannot find anywhere. "
8599,Howard,"i don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
10645,Howard,i am making molecular cocktails. this sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
10647,Howard,first take a picture with me.
8606,Howard,me?
10654,Howard,you don’t think i’m a leader?
10656,Howard,all by myself.
6563,Howard,give him time.
6564,Howard,and some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
10661,Howard,i suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
8614,Howard,i’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with penny.
10663,Howard,"building on what sheldon said, i could go for chinese."
8618,Howard,let’s see the new phone.
8619,Howard,"really? me? that’s, like, the best part."
8620,Howard,"oh, yeah."
8621,Howard,"oh, let me try the voice recognition."
6577,Howard,so don’t look at it.
8626,Howard,yes. his phone.
10674,Howard,"okay, the wifi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. we should be getting an image."
10676,Howard,"step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
6582,Howard,oh for god’s sake.
10678,Howard,sheldon.
6584,Howard,renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. they’re about taking chubby girls who work at kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
8633,Howard,i got pretty exciting nasa news today. next week i fly to houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
6586,Howard,hello.
8634,Howard,"open the pod bay doors, hal."
6588,Howard,are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
8637,Howard,"no, that’s not what i’m talking about."
8638,Howard,no.
8641,Howard,like how?
6594,Howard,"yeah, so, be a tool. go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
6595,Howard,you mean like you and richard the slave girl?
8642,Howard,did it work?
10689,Howard,"well, i, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
10693,Howard,hey.
10694,Howard,"relax, it’ll be fine."
8648,Howard,mass. that’s a cool nickname. ‘cause force equals mass times acceleration.
8652,Howard,my mom. sorry.
8653,Howard,"no problem, fruit loops."
10702,Howard,"there’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
6607,Howard,"yes, you are."
8656,Howard,i wonder what he wants.
6610,Howard,so what’s your news?
8659,Howard,i don’t think i could ever let a guy give me a massage.
6613,Howard,"poverty? your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a bentley."
8662,Howard,isn’t that just feynman’s idea?
6615,Howard,you were a colossal ass-hat.
8664,Howard,"i know, it’s not on my wedding diet. i don’t care."
10712,Howard,"well, i’m not flying it."
10713,Howard,i don’t know. must be getting a wifi signal from somewhere else.
10714,Howard,hey.
10715,Howard,"i mean, for a while, everything was vampires. now it’s all zombies. i wonder what the next monster fad will be."
6623,Howard,told you.
10721,Howard,"that was a big sticky mess, but i think i got it."
6626,Howard,"oh, gee, thanks."
6627,Howard,"gee, i’d love to raj, but i can’t make it."
8675,Howard,"no. i’m not mad at you. i just wish you would have come to me, so i didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
8676,Howard,you really want me to sign a pre-nup?
8678,Howard,done.
10722,Howard,"yes, i cleaned it up all by myself. honestly, i don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe i missed one spot. just leave."
6632,Howard,so you’re just going to sit around here and mope while penny is out with doctor apu from the kwik-e-mart?
10728,Howard,"buddy, other than jenny craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life."
8684,Howard,i wonder how long sheldon’s got.
10735,Howard,"oh, i’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer."
10736,Howard,"bernie, stuart just pulled up. so remember, the key is to be firm. show no weakness."
8689,Howard,sheldon was higher.
6642,Howard,"no, just for the fun of it, i’m gonna take his side."
10741,Howard,his middle name is david. go.
6647,Howard,"yeah, but albert einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
8697,Howard,"quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from i’m going"
6652,Howard,i haven’t configured it yet. let’s see… bradley tank… transport truck…  batmobile…
8700,Howard,"it’s pretty neat. you get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
10749,Howard,everything’s gonna be okay.
6655,Howard,"fine, what colour do you want?"
10754,Howard,"you think it’s hard having one wife, try having two."
6659,Howard,really? why?
10756,Howard,"look, i know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself."
10757,Howard,doesn’t matter. what are you mad about?
10758,Howard,"and you have every right to be mad about those things. so, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? i mean, don’t even look at it."
6664,Howard,i do. i love me a cup of joe.
6666,Howard,"to watch, right?"
8718,Howard,48 hours of star wars gaming.
8719,Howard,"yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
10769,Howard,right now.
6674,Howard,and kreplach.
10771,Howard,i told you to put tape on his mouth.
6676,Howard,"well, as it turns out, it’s also a klingon word."
8727,Howard,i’ll miss you.
6680,Howard,look at those women.
6681,Howard,"oh, look, the’s the future mrs. wolowitz. no, wait, that’s the future mrs. wolowitz. with her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. it’s the future mrs. wolowitz."
8729,Howard,"that’s my ride, got to go. "
10776,Howard,"okay, calm down. there’s a theme to this weekend. we are going to mexico in feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house feynman bought with the money from his nobel prize."
10778,Howard,"oh, not a problem. if anything goes down, we just put koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
8733,Howard,"come on, who is it?"
8734,Howard,"no, uh, i don’t think so."
10783,Howard,every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
10784,Howard,"wow, this one’s really stuck."
6691,Howard,just put it back before he comes!
10788,Howard,exactly. i’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
6694,Howard,"one of us, one of us."
6697,Howard,that’s what they said to neil armstrong about the moon.
6698,Howard,"well, my fellow americans, before this year is out we will put a wolowitz on one of america’s top models."
8746,Howard,so you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
8748,Howard,i told everybody.
8749,Howard,"well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
8752,Howard,"believe me, i know. the e-mail i got was from the office of stephen hawking."
10802,Howard,"you know, i’ve actually had one i’ve been sitting on for years."
10803,Howard,"it was for this power trio i tried to put together in junior high, but i was short two friends."
6708,Howard,"you know what? if it’s creepy to use the internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, i’m creepy."
8758,Howard,not on your life.
10808,Howard,"oh yes, definitely. hang on. thunder clapped as thor raised his mighty hammer. indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma."
10810,Howard,"oh, man, that rocks."
6715,Howard,"a neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “normally, i’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” i’ve got a whole list of ’em. who wants to be my wingman?"
6716,Howard,"step one, she notices the eye patch. may i say, penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? "
8763,Howard,have you met my mother? i live in jewish hell.
10814,Howard,"you played it for emily, didn’t you?"
8769,Howard,it was great. we talked about movies.
8771,Howard,he even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
10819,Howard,i don’t need this. i’m quitting the band.
6725,Howard,"yes, i was bad. maybe she’ll spank me. can we please move on?"
8773,Howard,you’re kidding.
10821,Howard,"raj, wait."
10822,Howard,"indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
8779,Howard,i do.
6732,Howard,"erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
8780,Howard,"yeah, i know, i’m just trying to figure out how much i want to punish him."
6734,Howard,"no, you’re mistaken."
6735,Howard,i don’t know what you’re talking about.
8787,Howard,that’s nice.
6740,Howard,how do we decide that?
10836,Howard,my name is darth vader. i am your father. prepare to die.
10838,Howard,"oh, boy."
6744,Howard,sheldon?
10841,Howard,"if you need liquid helium so bad, i know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions."
8795,Howard,"it’s not her fault. she’s getting hormone replacement therapy. makes her crazy horny. check this out, i got sheldon to wear the french maid’s costume."
6748,Howard,"anyway, call me. it’s howard."
6749,Howard,son of a bitch.
6750,Howard,i’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
8796,Howard,"hey, i gave you first crack at it."
6752,Howard,look at leonard’s record. 27 days with joyce kim.
10844,Howard,"if you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money."
10845,Howard,what was wrong with that guy?
10847,Howard,"hang on, i’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. the man who will father your children. okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
10852,Howard,"howard? uh-oh. make room, visigoths. ‘sup?"
6757,Howard,yes.
6758,Howard,"oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
6759,Howard,stephanie barnett is in a relationship with leonard hofstadter.”
10853,Howard,"oh, no, not this again."
6763,Howard,"uh, leonard, huge mistake. there’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
10862,Howard,i guess we didn’t use it very often. unless we had company. which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
10863,Howard,yes. so back me up. the house is good the way it is.
6769,Howard,"oh, yeah. it’s beyond contemptible."
8820,Howard,"oh, please shut up."
10868,Howard,"yeah. yeah, i feel like an archaeologist. indiana jones and the single-family dwelling. hey. look. found a seashell."
6774,Howard,"okay, he’s invited for dinner in the bottle city of kandor. he miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little kryptonian tetherball?” superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible kryptonian perspiration."
8823,Howard,"how about you? did you have a fun night? yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
6776,Howard,"leonard. now, raj. now, sheldon."
10870,Howard,sorry. do you have a sense of where we are?
6779,Howard,"doesn’t do anything for me. if i was gonna go that way, i’m more of a zac ephron kinda guy."
8828,Howard,what is this?
6786,Howard,"gather round, kids, it’s time for sheldon’s beloved christmas special."
8834,Howard,"all right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
8836,Howard,penny has a message for you.
6789,Howard,it’s happening to us.
8837,Howard,do you want me to go?
10886,Howard,hubba bubba over dubble bubble? you’re crazy.
8842,Howard,"yes, yes, i’ve been doing my push-ups. i’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
8843,Howard,"well, that’s it. my orders have been rescinded. i am officially no go to space."
10890,Howard,"if you don’t want to use dating web sites, what do you suggest?"
6798,Howard,"featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
8847,Howard,"all right, well, whatever. i wasn’t worried."
6800,Howard,"gentlemen, goggles."
10897,Howard,congratulations.
10898,Howard,then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire.
10900,Howard,"and no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
6808,Howard,"wait a minute. this isn’t flirting, you’re serious."
8857,Howard,"you’re right. i, i can’t go to space. i have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. i’ll call him back."
6810,Howard,"i’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
8858,Howard,"well, too bad, you already did. it’s a done deal. oh, well. but i forgive you."
10905,Howard,maybe we did make the test too difficult.
6813,Howard,i don’t want to talk to anybody.
6814,Howard,i don’t have homework. i’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
10909,Howard,"oh. cool.  hey, siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
6818,Howard,i don’t want to talk to her.
8867,Howard,"no, thank you. i’m allergic."
6820,Howard,i’m fine.
10914,Howard,maybe i’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
6831,Howard,you really think so?
10928,Howard,"oh, yeah. nothing better than helping people. which is something i realized when i was viewing earth from the deck of the international space station, where i spent two months as a payload specialist, a job i was qualified for because i’m an mit-trained engineer."
10929,Howard,"sorry. it’s just, you’re you, you know? and i really want you to adopt me."
6835,Howard,"oh, no. a little electrical tape, some solder. are you insane? i’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
10931,Howard,is that a job offer? ‘cause i really want to go to mars. assuming i can bring my wife. she hardly takes up any room. she’s basically a carry-on.
10934,Howard,really? why?
6839,Howard,"oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
6841,Howard,what a jerk.
6846,Howard,have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
6848,Howard,gee. why can’t sheldon make friends?
10944,Howard,i’ll keep rockin’. you don’t do that.
6851,Howard,"me, me. let it be me."
6852,Howard,guilty as charged. i’m out.
8900,Howard,"i mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us."
10948,Howard,look at this. trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
8903,Howard,"i’m sorry, ma… bernadette. ma… burna… you’re ma bernadette."
10951,Howard,and at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
6857,Howard,wow. i don’t see how we missed that.
10953,Howard,"after that, all i did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until i found his twitter handle."
10956,Howard,"could you imagine? what a cool way for us to meet. he’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
6863,Howard,he has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. kind of like a puppy.
6864,Howard,ugh. this mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
8911,Howard,that’s great.
10959,Howard,"come on, trent, you’re better than th-ah."
6867,Howard,what is it?
10963,Howard,same here!
10965,Howard,got ’em.
6870,Howard,"yes. koothrappali’s going to wet himself, i’m gonna throw up, sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. shall we synchronize our watches?"
8918,Howard,what?
6872,Howard,"come on, leonard, let’s go"
10966,Howard,"well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  "
8922,Howard,she doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so i’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
10967,Howard,"it’s like going with your grandpa. instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
8924,Howard,"ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
10973,Howard,he’s right.
8928,Howard,i have strongly mixed feelings.
6881,Howard,"wow, you must be very proud."
8930,Howard,"i’m excited to talk to you, too."
10977,Howard,hi.
10978,Howard,what kind of doctor is she?
10981,Howard,fear of failure.
6892,Howard,"yeah, still funny, raj."
10989,Howard,what?
10990,Howard,"you know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
6896,Howard,why don’t i run away and you cover me?
6897,Howard,i had to take her! it’s almost bathing suit weather!
6898,Howard,"oh, leslie, thank god."
8946,Howard,"okay, here it is. bernadette and i are starting a life together and…"
10993,Howard,he’s gone. let’s start in the garage.
6901,Howard,"well, we’re surrounded, so i guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
10996,Howard,"as long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
10997,Howard,"well, what do you think we should do?"
8952,Howard,"hey, i’m a grown man. i’m gonna live with my wife. my mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own."
11002,Howard,of course not. he drove us crazy. like when you were gonna make that pie and stuart ate all the blueberries.
8958,Howard,"you don’t have to shout, raj. it’s not like i’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. oh, wait, i am."
8960,Howard,excuse me. i’m talking to my friends.
6913,Howard,"court-martial, schmort-martial, leslie winkle is the fifth girl i’ve ever had sex with. i mean, for free."
11010,Howard,we should all take a trip or something.
11011,Howard,bernie would love that.
6918,Howard,"oh, it’s great. everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out."
6921,Howard,"i’m busy, ma!"
11018,Howard,"ooh, check out the stripper pole."
6924,Howard,are you jewish?
8973,Howard,"great, i’ll do that when i want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie."
11021,Howard,"here we are talking about frozen, and yet, you got burned."
11026,Howard,you’re a screenwriter?
6931,Howard,bye.
8980,Howard,"love you too. hey, bernie? before you go, can you do something for me?"
11029,Howard,"so, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
6935,Howard,thanks.
11032,Howard,really? so it’s okay if i fl…
6937,Howard,when did that happen?
11034,Howard,what?
8988,Howard,"oh, a lot better, thanks. one sec. listen close, i don’t have a lot of time. i need you to go to my house. in my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. i want you to take it and bring it back to your place."
11037,Howard,"me, too. and i think you’re even more beautiful than this rose."
8993,Howard,the jewish prayer for eating bread! we don’t have one for falling out of space! we did it! we’re on the ground! we survived!
8997,Howard,gesundheit. you okay?
9001,Howard,okay.
6958,Howard,"well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
6959,Howard,"fine, go ahead. take a shot."
6960,Howard,"i will, i’m just working on my opening line."
11055,Howard,"um, taking care of injured rabbit. okay. make sure it’s comfortable and warm. well, it was just in a hot tub. i’m gonna say check."
9010,Howard,all right. woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. suddenly she’s not decent?
11056,Howard,"to make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. if it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. yeah."
6964,Howard,what’s going on?
11061,Howard,"poor judgement, obviously."
6966,Howard,raj.
6968,Howard,you tell me.
9016,Howard,one to beam aboard?
11066,Howard,he’s not showing any symptoms. i guess i’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
11067,Howard,"no, when i sat on the mute button and thought i’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
9021,Howard,"oh, stuart, thanks. what are you doing here?"
11070,Howard,"continued on milk. if you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. are. we are. see spoons for more."
9024,Howard,"sound of music sing-along? that used to be our thing, but that’s cool."
9025,Howard,so i’d be sitting by myself?
9033,Howard,"yes, please.  perfect."
6988,Howard,"uh, i’ve seen this before."
11084,Howard,this isn’t a joke.
9039,Howard,not really.
6993,Howard,and i’ll bet lesbians love bluetooth.
9041,Howard,creature from the black forest ham lagoon.
6995,Howard,"oh, stop with the fake third world crap. your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
6996,Howard,"oh, god, we’re never gonna finish in time. who made sheldon the boss anyway?"
11091,Howard,"maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
6998,Howard,that’s your entire profit margin.
6999,Howard,you can’t be serious.
7001,Howard,"sorry, guys, but secret agent laser obstacle lunch is just stupid."
9049,Howard,"so, i did this amazing thing and i’m never allowed to mention it?"
7003,Howard,"so, there is a number."
11099,Howard,maybe you’re right.
11101,Howard,thank you.
7007,Howard,"i won’t lie, it’s pretty dope."
7008,Howard,"oh, pish-posh.  shucks means shucks. let one go once in a while."
7009,Howard,"yeah, what’s the occasion?"
9057,Howard,"you know what, guys? never mind. i just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again."
11110,Howard,don’t say that to him.
9063,Howard,who cares?
7017,Howard,here we go.
9065,Howard,"well, i’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, i went to space! space, space! space! space, space! space!"
11117,Howard,is the impression that your first name is pee-wee?
9073,Howard,i don’t know. raj sent me some video of buzz aldrin.
9074,Howard,"okay, i get it."
7030,Howard,you let go.
7034,Howard,so what are you kids up to?
11132,Howard,"yeah, one sec. i just need to sign this contract."
7042,Howard,wrong again!
7043,Howard,"look, there are plenty of bars in los angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
9090,Howard,good for you.
9092,Howard,"yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks."
7057,Howard,"don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
11153,Howard,scientifically? a little over a year ago. legos? last week in my room.
7059,Howard,"okay, are you from star wars universe?"
7060,Howard,were you in the original trilogy?
11154,Howard,"there’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
11155,Howard,"while we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with teflon tape."
11156,Howard,i don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
7066,Howard,"i don’t know. she just said howard, momma’s a rolling stone. and then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
9114,Howard,"fine, let’s go."
9117,Howard,"i know. it’s just ever since my dad left, i’ve felt responsible for her."
11167,Howard,"well, i keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
9120,Howard,where we going?
7074,Howard,"first row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
9123,Howard,"oh, you silly doodlebug."
11171,Howard,"we went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
9126,Howard,"i’m looking at his public calendar. two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. he never has anything booked during that time."
7079,Howard,"seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?"
7082,Howard,"really, me too."
7083,Howard,yeah. excuse me for a moment.
11179,Howard,really?
9133,Howard,should we follow him?
11182,Howard,what the hell are you watching?
9135,Howard,don’t you know his schedule?
11187,Howard,i’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
9140,Howard,can’t you face the other way and listen?
11189,Howard,so you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
9144,Howard,"fine, i’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar."
11193,Howard,"look, raj, you’re my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
9147,Howard,"yes, i’m sure. now, you stand guard, i’m going to…"
11196,Howard,"oh. okay. yeah, i get it. i’ll back off."
7101,Howard,"all right, this is an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system as deployed on the international space station."
7102,Howard,"yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station. we gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
7103,Howard,"classified, leonard."
9153,Howard,"don’t worry, i’m one step ahead of him."
7106,Howard,"no good. i mean, it might work for the japanese and the americans, but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there? this thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
7110,Howard,"hang on, i think i’ve got this. help me see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod."
9158,Howard,forty-three. what is forty-three? besides my mom’s neck size.
11206,Howard,"hey, look at that. it’s weird again."
7114,Howard,"hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
7115,Howard,"i got your back, sister. all right, i think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. hand me that tupperware."
9163,Howard,we should stop. i’m exhausted.
11210,Howard,we did.
7119,Howard,"yes, sir, i understand classified. we’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
9168,Howard,it better be. it’s the spare camera for the mars rover.
7121,Howard,meatloaf.
11219,Howard,"i’m not sure if i’m hoping for a boy or a girl. i mean, if it’s a boy, i’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. which means i’m gonna have to google how to play catch. if it’s a girl, i mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are."
9172,Howard,"oh, my god!"
11220,Howard,there you go again.
11221,Howard,"actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
9175,Howard,"hey, fellas, what’s going on?"
11222,Howard,"oh, i wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
9178,Howard,"yep. for as long as i can keep my mother out of it. if you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294."
7131,Howard,i could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills sheldon.
11227,Howard,"wait, what is going on?"
9181,Howard,"fun story. meanwhile, you still don’t have a car."
9182,Howard,are you listening to yourself?
11232,Howard,so what the hell happened?
7138,Howard,"okay, why?"
9186,Howard,"sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and i want it back."
7140,Howard,"ma, i’m putting you on speakerphone with raj’s parents. can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the arctic?"
7141,Howard,i didn’t say that. you never listen to me!
11235,Howard,yeah.
9192,Howard,"well, we appear to have reached an impasse. and you know, i have to say, i thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk."
7146,Howard,there’s no time for a crossbow. find me an icicle.
7149,Howard,great.
11247,Howard,"well, we’re out. bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. and she’s pregnant because we had sex. and we had sex because, well, come on."
11251,Howard,"actually, it’s making me dizzy."
7156,Howard,"that’s why i added the tator. and then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
9204,Howard,stop that. you stop that.
7158,Howard,we had to.
9206,Howard,"i had no idea how much that spot meant to you. anyway, i called president siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and i’ll park in the structure across the street."
7160,Howard,thanks. i call it the clooney.
11252,Howard,hey. where is everybody?
7162,Howard,"personally, i don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
7163,Howard,what are you doing?
9210,Howard,"i’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet."
11253,Howard,oh. cool.
11261,Howard,"yeah, hey, buddy."
9216,Howard,"great, thank you."
11266,Howard,"yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons."
9220,Howard,i like rare chicken. let’s do this.
9223,Howard,had no idea you were the chatty one.
7176,Howard,what are you doing here?
9224,Howard,"okay, dig in."
11274,Howard,you got something better?
9227,Howard,sure. i can hear it in your voice.
11276,Howard,yeah. he still has an aol address.
7181,Howard,ashamed? horrified? repulsed?
7182,Howard,sex is never the way i dream it’s gonna be.
11279,Howard,"if you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
9233,Howard,i’ve never even been fishing. this is gonna be a disaster.
7187,Howard,"oh, give me a frickin’ break. how could you possibly know that?"
9236,Howard,ew!
11285,Howard,i’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of raj.
9238,Howard,okay.
7193,Howard,"i will put up my fantastic four number 48, first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123, the classic flash of two worlds issue."
11294,Howard,"hmm. we request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. that’s weird."
7199,Howard,"don’t push me, sheldon. i may be small, but i took kung fu when i was 13, and i remember a good deal of it."
7201,Howard,"that is not toby, this is toby. raj, what do you think?"
11297,Howard,"am i? am i? what, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and i’m no longer in it? that chess club picture is now just david zimmerman and elaine cho."
7203,Howard,"yeah, fine, whatever. the point is, you’re wrong again."
11300,Howard,"i don’t know what to do. it’s the air force. i mean, should i respond to their e-mail? ignore it?"
7205,Howard,you’re such a girl. they’re just bugs.
7206,Howard,"no, you don’t understand. we just want to ask you a question."
9254,Howard,"no, but i’m not a stranger to dice games. i was the temple beth-el hebrew school yahtzee champion."
9256,Howard,"okay. oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, mike?"
9257,Howard,great couple of gals.
11302,Howard,it’s not nonsense. this is how the u.s. military works.
7213,Howard,"okay, how about you two? look, i’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
9261,Howard,"okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
9262,Howard,can we please move this along?
11310,Howard,hang on.
11314,Howard,i have performance anxiety. you of all people should know that.
11316,Howard,yeah. i would not have done that for you.
9270,Howard,good story.
11318,Howard,"yes, hello. uh, this is howard wolowitz for colonel richard williams."
11320,Howard,why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? it has to be bad news.
7229,Howard,okay.
9279,Howard,do you really think you should be drinking right now?
9282,Howard,oh.
7235,Howard,she’s not going to see it. she takes my temperature orally now.
11331,Howard,"sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
9286,Howard,"i’m sorry, i’m a feminist, i don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has."
7239,Howard,"ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
7243,Howard,"no, i haven’t, look.  i’m sorry, i’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
9291,Howard,"sheldon, how is that a fight pose?"
11341,Howard,"marty, let me call you back."
11342,Howard,no.
11343,Howard,hello.
9298,Howard,i wish my mom was here. we could all hang out in her shadow.
7251,Howard,whatever.
7252,Howard,"no, no. look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
7254,Howard,we say they’re in a very intimate area.
7255,Howard,"right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
9305,Howard,"you’re still out, right?"
11355,Howard,you are a deeply silly man.
9309,Howard,what?
9310,Howard,i can’t believe i wasted all that money.
11359,Howard,"oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
7264,Howard,"well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
7265,Howard,"the bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
9313,Howard,"oh, yeah? how’s that?"
7267,Howard,"okay, she’s gone."
11364,Howard,"well, i don’t know, midnight, one."
9318,Howard,we don’t need malibu koothrappali’s dream house.
7272,Howard,i’m really going to miss you.
11368,Howard,thanks again for breakfast.
9322,Howard,"okay, give me a superhero pose, and i will scan you into the computer for your action figure."
7275,Howard,hello.
7276,Howard,am i interrupting?
9323,Howard,stop holding your stomach in. i’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
11375,Howard,no worries.
7282,Howard,"fine, let’s watch it. maybe all our periods will synchronize."
9330,Howard,"koothrappali and i bought a used 3-d printer for $5,000."
11380,Howard,"we, we’re thinking, two years."
7286,Howard,"what do you guys think? want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
11382,Howard,"yes, thank you so much."
7288,Howard,"oh. i get it, i’m the third wheel. sorry, i should have seen that. i’ll get out of your way. uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
11384,Howard,"yeah, we could name him blobert."
11385,Howard,bloberta. or blobbi with an i.
9339,Howard,it’s my suitcase. i lent it to you two years ago.
9340,Howard,"no, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. it’s part of a bonus she got."
7294,Howard,"well, i guess game’s over."
7295,Howard,not ka. ka-ah.
9342,Howard,"anyway, it was bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
7297,Howard,"you and i made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
9345,Howard,"she’s huge. it was funny. anyway, i was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay."
11390,Howard,i don’t know. maybe the surprise will make it more fun. like magic tricks. remember how disappointed you were when i explained the never-ending hanky?
7300,Howard,"yeah, raj, that’s how it works."
9348,Howard,i told her around seven.
11392,Howard,"but you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. ta-da."
9351,Howard,what? you spent the night?
9354,Howard,"if you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life."
9356,Howard,"oh, really? where are your clothes and your shoes?"
7309,Howard,great. so what did you tell her about me? did you mention the body fat?
9358,Howard,what were we thinking? we should have just done it the regular way.
11404,Howard,i’m sorry. we don’t have to go.
9366,Howard,"yeah, one second. come here. i want to show you something."
11416,Howard,"well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
7321,Howard,okay.
9369,Howard,a micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
9370,Howard,"mmm, about twelve hours. i pulled an all-nighter."
7324,Howard,of course it did.
11417,Howard,stuart. he heard me talking about us going away. i guess he decided to invite himself over?
11421,Howard,"well, clearly, i lied."
9377,Howard,"she hid my xbox like i’m a child. yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, i’m telling."
9378,Howard,i said i’m sorry.
9379,Howard,"i told you, turn them inside out."
11425,Howard,you jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
11426,Howard,that’s a kick. that’s an actual kick.
11430,Howard,do we? look at you. willy wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
11431,Howard,are we even in a good school…? ow!
9385,Howard,"i’m telling you, something’s wrong. i can always feel it when raj is in trouble."
11436,Howard,"but it’s the safest crib you can buy. and if you don’t like it, we can return it."
9389,Howard,"i’m sorry. that’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off."
11438,Howard,"it’s for the baby, and i didn’t buy it. the dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
11439,Howard,the guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore. 
11440,Howard,"it’s got a rearview camera, there’s a dvd player, oh, and check this out. it’s like we’re living in the future."
7347,Howard,it’s not a little scooter. it’s the second biggest vespa they make! are you watching football?
7348,Howard,"all i know about saks is, my mother shops there."
11444,Howard,yes.
11445,Howard,"see? easy. and look at all this cargo space. now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. i’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
9399,Howard,"boy, i want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy."
11446,Howard,"oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the gps can take us to the nearest emergency room."
11448,Howard,"you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair. which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
7354,Howard,"look, i admit i haven’t always been the best friend i could be."
7355,Howard,stipulated.
9402,Howard,all right. thanks for ruining lobster for me.
11453,Howard,"oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags."
9406,Howard,"van nuys pole-dancer d.d. melons. all right, i think we’ve really helped women today. let’s fire up the old xbox."
7361,Howard,come on. let me take you someplace nice.
9409,Howard,"maybe i could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students."
11461,Howard,so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny?
21703,Howard,and you just assume you’re always right?
9417,Howard,"no, but i was in the rocket. i didn’t actually…"
21705,Howard,why?
21709,Howard,you’re not going with us.
9423,Howard,you said clean up. i’m cleaning up.
9424,Howard,"hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. this isn’t sex."
11472,Howard,"oh, did you meet her at work?"
11473,Howard,"so, when do we meet her?"
11475,Howard,hi. howard wolowitz.
11476,Howard,"oh, yeah, the astronomer. raj told us about you. hey, free toilet paper."
21712,Howard,"she grows any more hair on her face, yes."
21717,Howard,what’s happening?
9432,Howard,"you know, if he really wants to stay and finish, i can give him a ride home."
9433,Howard,juggle.
7391,Howard,"ooh, real sex."
11487,Howard,i found him in an old box.
9441,Howard,"of course i’m curious. i haven’t seen the man since, oh, i was a little kid. and a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? what’s that about?"
7394,Howard,"okay, the best i can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
11488,Howard,i didn’t buy it. i made it.
7396,Howard,i am.
7397,Howard,"look, they gave me homemade cookies."
9444,Howard,yep.
9445,Howard,i do.  great. neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
9447,Howard,i am.
11489,Howard,what’s the big deal?
11494,Howard,i have no problem calling him.
11498,Howard,do you think this is in poor taste?
7406,Howard,"to this day, i can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. oh, cousin jeanie."
9454,Howard,in here.
9455,Howard,it’s okay. sorry i ran off like that.
9456,Howard,"uh, pictures of my dad and me when i was a kid."
11503,Howard,what is going on? did you upgrade his software last night?
11504,Howard,and i think you’re cute.
7412,Howard,"hot dogs, buns, s’mores, i mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
11507,Howard,when would you move in?
11510,Howard,it’s like we have a butler. if i had a batsuit i’d be bruce wayne.
7417,Howard,and she was my second cousin.
11514,Howard,"mm, i know. it’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
11517,Howard,"guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
7422,Howard,"to be honest, i was hoping at least second base."
7423,Howard,"a jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
11518,Howard,"oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, i can do this. we have a plan. somebody please tell me the plan."
11522,Howard,sorry. i know you were just trying to help. i love you.
7428,Howard,"you know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
7429,Howard,three dates means sex? who knew?
9478,Howard,you could talk some smack about his mother.
7432,Howard,"hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
9481,Howard,why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? i need your laptop so i can configure the software.
9482,Howard,what?
9483,Howard,cool. anything juicy?
11530,Howard,"just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. stuart, stop driving like an old man. speed it up a little."
7440,Howard,"hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean i have to."
11541,Howard,do you want me to get the nurse?
9495,Howard,"is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
9497,Howard,the key to her heart. that’s nice. were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
11547,Howard,of course.
11548,Howard,"hey, guys."
11551,Howard,what did we miss?
9504,Howard,"you know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?"
11558,Howard,"i mean, it’s stuart. maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away."
11560,Howard,"she doesn’t hate you, stop saying that."
9513,Howard,"no, i wasn’t. you were."
11562,Howard,bernie?
9516,Howard,"good thinking.  cinnamon, come to daddy."
7469,Howard,what?
11568,Howard,"good job, mommy. i’m proud of you."
11573,Howard,"yeah, got to get her hooked on tv or someday she’ll want me to play outside. boy, that floor is so squeaky. i’m surprised i didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
7478,Howard,"wow! you really are a piece of work. it’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
9526,Howard,"the ladies are away, the boys will play."
9531,Howard,"we’ll be fine, watch. suddenly, a spectral shape rises from koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  well, i’m just a tree, but if i were you, i’d listen to your ghost friend."
9532,Howard,"uh, it does. "
7486,Howard,"no, no, don’t move. hey, ma, can i have lamb stew for dinner?"
11584,Howard,"okay, space a3, here we go. it’s squeaking. mark it."
11585,Howard,mm. i hope she has the same amount of sex in it i did. none. next square.
11587,Howard,"so, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. watch. it’s easy,"
9546,Howard,oh.
11595,Howard,"well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
7500,Howard,"yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
9548,Howard,"leonard, i may have gotten you a job."
7503,Howard,hi.
9552,Howard,what the hell? i thought i was your best friend.
11602,Howard,you’re so stupid.
7507,Howard,which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys.
11603,Howard,"no, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
7509,Howard,it was a full turtleneck. why aren’t you helping me?
11608,Howard,"sorry, is that gary with one r or two?"
9569,Howard,"i heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
9570,Howard,"mrs. davis, nice to see you. "
11618,Howard,those do look fun.
9576,Howard,so nothing.
9578,Howard,both versions: original and lohan. you’re an idiot.
7533,Howard,"seventh base with shirt off. well, my shirt. how’d things go with penny?"
7534,Howard,are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent cylons?
11632,Howard,"i don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
9586,Howard,i don’t know. few weeks. why?
11634,Howard,it’s so peaceful without him here. can i ask you how much that cost?
9588,Howard,you’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
7541,Howard,your new girlfriend. have fun tonight.
7542,Howard,"boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? just the guys."
11638,Howard,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
7544,Howard,it doesn’t mean any of that! it’s a typo.
11640,Howard,"i don’t know, but if he yells it’s alive, we run."
11645,Howard,maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
9599,Howard,"hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
7554,Howard,have you tried rebooting him?
9604,Howard,stop it.
11655,Howard,"go. come on, raj."
11656,Howard,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
9609,Howard,hallelujah.
7563,Howard,"thanks. you, too."
7564,Howard,not really. i was in my boogie zone.
11660,Howard,"come on, raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just waiting to exhale. yeah, i knew you could do it."
7566,Howard,"i bet if we all chipped in, we could buy sheldon a van."
11662,Howard,"oh, no, now we have two."
7568,Howard,that’s not true. my happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
9616,Howard,"if it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake."
9618,Howard,have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
9620,Howard,"huh, i guess you’re right. wonder why that is?"
11670,Howard,that’s understandable.
7578,Howard,absolutely. and i’d leave him there. 
7582,Howard,i’m sad to say i taught him those moves.
9631,Howard,"they’re coming to america, they’re coming to america."
7586,Howard,"sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
7587,Howard,but there must be thousands of dollars here. why don’t you put it in the bank?
11687,Howard,what? why? 
7592,Howard,"okay, he’s going to jail."
7593,Howard,"wow. uh, stan lee, or you in court? uh, if this was sophie’s choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. no."
9642,Howard,"leonard, you ready for lunch?"
9643,Howard,"hi, penny."
9648,Howard,you sound kind of proud of it.
11698,Howard,"dinner’s almost ready. if you like meatloaf, i’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
9651,Howard,that’s it? no compassion?
9654,Howard,i’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
7607,Howard,you see what you’re doing? stop that.
7610,Howard,"listen, i was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. no copyright notice on it. so, i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
9662,Howard,"no, no, listen to me. sheldon misunderstood. what i meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
9665,Howard,it’s nothing in particular. i…
11715,Howard,i don’t know. why are you asking all these questions?
7620,Howard,it’s sad how great that sounds.
9670,Howard,"please, stop talking."
7623,Howard,"if you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great aunt ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat."
9672,Howard,i don’t know. sounds kind of heavy.
7625,Howard,you brought a lawyer?
11721,Howard,what are you doing here?
9675,Howard,"tell me about it. one time, i swear i pooped out a stick of chalk.  i’ll get it."
7628,Howard,i say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
11722,Howard,i’ll say it again. india.
7630,Howard,"you know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
9678,Howard,that’s not true.
7632,Howard,will you be quiet?
11729,Howard,nice. 174 diapers. that ought to get us to wednesday.
9682,Howard,thanks for getting me in trouble.
7635,Howard,that’s not gonna better pull out the big gun.
9687,Howard,next week is the anniversary of my first date with bernadette.
7645,Howard,what’s your point?
7646,Howard,"yeah, the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
7647,Howard,didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
9695,Howard,"seriously, congratulations, sheldon."
11742,Howard,"son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
7655,Howard,"hey, leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
7656,Howard,what’s with him?
9708,Howard,"ever since i met you, you turned my world around. you supported all my dreams and all my hopes. you’re like uranium-235 and i’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you bernadette."
11759,Howard,"hey, how’s it going?"
7664,Howard,did you ask her to start waxing?
11760,Howard,good. love you.
7667,Howard,did you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? because you can die that way.
11763,Howard,"no, no, nothing. okay, well, maybe i’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
9718,Howard,"it’s true, you’d rust."
7672,Howard,i guessed premature. does that count?
7673,Howard,"you know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing wesley, it’d be the “wesley” crushers."
11769,Howard,"look, i don’t know what the best decision is, either. but whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
11770,Howard,"and the best part is halley won’t remember a thing. babies are cute, but they’re dumb. i mean, i go like this, she thinks i’m gone, then magically i’m back. i mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
11771,Howard,"should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? oh, howie, i don’t need food as long as i can look at my phone."
7677,Howard,what?
11772,Howard,you want to hear my stuart? it’s been a while since i’ve gone on a date. you mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
11777,Howard,how about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
9731,Howard,"you know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where i can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your dna in it."
11780,Howard,what are you making?
7686,Howard,okay.
11784,Howard,i guess. it wasn’t until college that i learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
7690,Howard,i parked my scooter down the block.
9739,Howard,you didn’t have to do that.
11789,Howard,she’s great. look.
9742,Howard,"so, you can never take it off?"
11790,Howard,see? nothing to worry about.
9744,Howard,is the point that you’re an idiot?
11792,Howard,what are you doing here?
7699,Howard,"yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
7700,Howard,"yeah, um, i have a two-part question."
9747,Howard,you had to be taught not to play with cobras?
11801,Howard,"okay, challenge them again."
7707,Howard,were you up making another stop-motion lego movie?
11803,Howard,kids are always better at video games.
7710,Howard,hi.
11807,Howard,"all right, this is everything. what do you want to learn?"
7712,Howard,"that’s why we moved halo night here. look, i brought my mom’s chicken soup."
7713,Howard,who’s that
9762,Howard,i have a better idea.
9763,Howard,i was gonna make raj do it all by himself.
9765,Howard,he doesn’t want me in there. i’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
7719,Howard,we broke up weeks ago.
11820,Howard,"i just told you, your mom’s."
11824,Howard,"well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
7730,Howard,preparing to fire laser at the moon.
7731,Howard,there it is. there’s the spike!
11829,Howard,"all right, you’re freaking me out."
7734,Howard,"no, it’s not… never mind. he is right, though. if you want, i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found."
11830,Howard,"phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
7739,Howard,what?
7742,Howard,"trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
11839,Howard,not really.
7745,Howard,"whatever. right now, dr. sheldon cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. greetings, fellow life-form…"
7746,Howard,not us. him.
11843,Howard,"hey, wait up."
7754,Howard,"well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
11851,Howard,"okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
7756,Howard,"all right, you can have a hot chocolate."
9806,Howard,i don’t want coffee.
11856,Howard,"i mean, not me, i’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on instagram."
7762,Howard,"ah, there you have it, gentlemen. our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
11863,Howard,guys. focus. should we do something about nowitzki?
11868,Howard,"baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me."
7773,Howard,borrowed. the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
7774,Howard,"raj and i entered sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out amy farrah fowler."
9822,Howard,"i’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. sorry, i thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen."
11871,Howard,"oh boy, i was afraid of this."
11872,Howard,"good point, how you gonna cool it?"
7778,Howard,"i’ll eat later. i’m busy! oh, yeah. just like a real hand. hmm."
11874,Howard,"bonjour mademoiselle, i understand you’re new in town. "
11877,Howard,we can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
7782,Howard,"please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
7783,Howard,"no, no! don’t touch, the program is paused."
9833,Howard,"you didn’t let me finish. here you go, mother."
7786,Howard,"okay, i can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. no pulling, no saws, no torches."
9834,Howard,"eh, tomato, tomahto. the important thing is she’s dead."
11884,Howard,"howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. why are you calling at this ungodly hour? "
9839,Howard,what’s your part?
7792,Howard,i slipped and fell.
9841,Howard,we’ll be there.
11888,Howard,i agree.
7796,Howard,you think you could be a little more discreet?
11892,Howard,what are you so happy about?
7800,Howard,here you go.
11898,Howard,"no, that’s what she said, sheldon."
9852,Howard,anybody home?
11900,Howard,"hey, steph, it’s me again, howard. listen, if you’re free friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. my mom cooks a hell of a brisket. let me know. it’s howard."
11901,Howard,"hey, it’s me again. just want to let you know the head count for dinner friday has gone up. my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs. oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-jewish on your mother’s side. okay, call me. it’s howard."
7811,Howard,toilet.
7812,Howard,"oh, and potty is okay?"
11907,Howard,"ooh, looks like i’m gonna have sex tonight. hey, baby…"
11910,Howard,"uh, pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings."
11912,Howard,"you’re right, that’s a great idea."
7817,Howard,"um, tell us about your work, amy."
7818,Howard,"raj, do you have any questions for amy?"
11914,Howard,"okay, i get it, you’re angry. you don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest."
11915,Howard,"fine, i’ll stay! you happy, crazy lady? i sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!"
11916,Howard,"leslie winkle. you’ve reached friends with benefits. for a booty call, press one now."
9872,Howard,t-minus 60 seconds.
9874,Howard,t-minus 30 seconds.
11924,Howard,"excuse me. oh, damn. it’s my mother."
7834,Howard,you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks.
9883,Howard,"not the same hulk. ferrigno, bana, norton and ruffalo."
9884,Howard,i already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
9885,Howard,"sheldon, just come with us. you’re not gonna make your own convention."
11933,Howard,"you’re right, penny jogs. maybe you guys can run together."
7839,Howard,"oh, not since we broke up. wow. how am i going to play this? sophisticated and relaxed? friendly, noncommittal? cold and distant? ."
9894,Howard,no need. i’m breaking rules all the time. 
7848,Howard,"no, i’m not."
11945,Howard,"no, it’s not necessarily proportional. shut up!"
9899,Howard,"okay, you guys are such babies. i’ll handle this. if he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
7853,Howard,"great, ma!"
11949,Howard,"bernie, you okay?"
7855,Howard,i did a stupid thing.
11952,Howard,i said i’m getting it!
9905,Howard,okay. just make it look like an accident.
7859,Howard,"now, you see, i don’t know if you’re kidding or not."
11955,Howard,"oh, hey, hi. nice to see you."
11957,Howard,he’s not talking about your shirt. your shirt is fine.
9910,Howard,she’s right. 
7863,Howard,i just have a question. does bernadette ever talk about me?
7864,Howard,she does?
9914,Howard,sorry.
7868,Howard,but it’s embarrassing.
7870,Howard,"well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
7871,Howard,her name was glissinda the troll. bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the bridge of souls.
7872,Howard,would you talk to her?
9918,Howard,say what?
7874,Howard,"well, for all we know, glissinda the troll wasn’t even a real woman. i mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in new jersey."
9923,Howard,not when i said mute and pointed it at her face.
11971,Howard,"hey, what’s up?"
11974,Howard,"if i didn’t have you, life would be blue, i’d be dr. who without the tardis."
9927,Howard,i told them i’d be honoured.
7880,Howard,"oh, no, that’s okay. how have you been?"
11975,Howard,"okay, great. bye. our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
7883,Howard,"not for me, thanks."
9932,Howard,"sit down. nasa called. the telescope mount i installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it."
7886,Howard,"penny, can we have a little privacy?"
7887,Howard,"well, you know how it is with guys. i mean, we have needs and…"
11982,Howard,can i help you?
7892,Howard,yeah.
9942,Howard,you don’t think i did a good job up there?
11992,Howard,that’s raj.
7897,Howard,"yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again."
9947,Howard,"okay, so i wasn’t exactly john glenn up there, but i’ve changed. i’m a different man now. yeah, and i’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think i can handle it."
9949,Howard,you’ve got to get me out of this.
7903,Howard,i had a good time.
7904,Howard,"you said, well, the move, remember?"
9951,Howard,"hi, ma. how are you?"
9954,Howard,"look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? drop it."
12000,Howard,hey.
9956,Howard,you mean tings like moo-stache?
7913,Howard,"yeah, i know what you mean."
7918,Howard,not that i’ve ever seen.
9973,Howard,you’re the reason i’m doing it.
7926,Howard,i have a girlfriend now.
9977,Howard,buzz aldrin.
7930,Howard,how could you? we had a pact!
9978,Howard,what now?
9983,Howard,"when? how about in the car? i’m an astronaut, and you know it. you just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous."
7937,Howard,"thanks. listen, i have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the fbi."
9986,Howard,here you go. be creative. what’s the matter? scared of a little turbulence?
9988,Howard,i’m gonna need that bag back.
9989,Howard,"i’m sorry, too. it’s all my fault."
9990,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
7944,Howard,"are you kidding me? you’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with i’m sorry?"
7952,Howard,all right. apology accepted.
10004,Howard,"well, did she see you in the window?"
7958,Howard,"actually, i’m not. i’m using sarcasm to mock you."
7966,Howard,too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
7967,Howard,"let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
7969,Howard,i guess we’d better go after him.
10018,Howard,and the healing begins.
10019,Howard,both great.
7976,Howard,"don’t be oversensitive. he’s calling you illiterate, not your race."
10024,Howard,"he’s gonna die alone, right?"
7978,Howard,is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? that happens with me and my mom all the time.
7982,Howard,"how could that be a miss? c-6 was a hit, c-8 was a hit. part of your starship has to be on c-7."
7984,Howard,"oh, great, you made it. come on in. i invited her."
7990,Howard,"yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
10039,Howard,"me, too. i just hope he doesn’t blow it."
7993,Howard,"three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 rupees, six, seven, whoops. can’t go any further. there’s a sacred cow in my way."
7995,Howard,it might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
7996,Howard,we’d come visit you.
10044,Howard,"well, you sure don’t. you i know, you i know, you? total stranger. even if you had yummy candy, i would not get in your van."
7999,Howard,what about that hook-up at comic-con you told me about?
10050,Howard,please don’t say it.
10054,Howard,"i’m sorry. i tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
8007,Howard,"yeah, i get it now."
8008,Howard,did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
8009,Howard,they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
10057,Howard,"well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you."
8011,Howard,why?
10058,Howard,"can i say just one more thing? i had some kind of food poisoning that day. sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. nor was climbing out your window and running away. but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and i’d really appreciate it if we could move on."
10059,Howard,i’m just saying…
10062,Howard,i need some fresh air.
8015,Howard,"leonard, settle this. of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?"
10064,Howard,"ugh. me, too. what happened?"
10065,Howard,i wouldn’t worry about it. he’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
10067,Howard,"get out of here, barry."
8020,Howard,"a jar with a big spider in it, of course. bravery test. first one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
8022,Howard,"oh, really? what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
8024,Howard,how did you get so brave all of a sudden?
10076,Howard,"beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets."
8034,Howard,we’re starting now!
8038,Howard,i prefer to think that i can’t lose.
8040,Howard,you narcissistic nincompoop!
10088,Howard,"okay, so you’d lose most of jar jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching c-span with monsters."
8043,Howard,"no, i know bullying. he left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
10093,Howard,"me, too."
10099,Howard,the doctor says you need to get exercise.
8054,Howard,"relax. no one’s going to be looking at her hair. ow! i mean, ow."
8057,Howard,"no, we can still make this work. leonard, you talk to penny."
8059,Howard,superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
8060,Howard,check it out. those guys are breaking into that car.
8061,Howard,"ma, ma, calm down. listen to me. i know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. now, put your finger on it. doesn’t matter which finger. good choice. now move it down to your e-mail icon. yeah, the little envelope. what do you mean, what does it look like? it looks like an envelope! fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. good-bye!"
10111,Howard,as advertised.
10113,Howard,"no, it’s not."
8066,Howard,"sheldon, i don’t think penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…"
10116,Howard,"i’m coming, you big baby."
8069,Howard,"there’s your answer, free food."
8074,Howard,"it means after we play handball, i’m showering at home."
8075,Howard,howard wolowitz. why not world’s greatest engineer?
10124,Howard,i’m proud of us.
8078,Howard,eureka!
10129,Howard,because you had sex the other night?
8082,Howard,we’re going to be hundred-aires.
8089,Howard,what could we do? he’s the travel supervisor.
8091,Howard,hi. ow. hi.
10139,Howard,"i just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
8093,Howard,"hey, bernie?"
10140,Howard,you sure?
8100,Howard,"i’m just thinking. if you had sex with that guy, i mean, there’s nothing i can do here that will make any kind of impact."
10149,Howard,"i don’t know, they’re, chummy."
10156,Howard,it’s not that precious.
8111,Howard,"look. listen to this one. does einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to dr. cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
8112,Howard,"apparently, if you’re sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
8113,Howard,"well, picture the hindenburg meets chernobyl meets three mile island meets tron 2."
10162,Howard,"now, i never thought i’d say this, but i’m kind of excited to see sheldon."
10166,Howard,your mother and i? you’re not my father.
8122,Howard,"i know. the only thing is, i’m gonna be gone for two years."
10170,Howard,"yeah, in my house."
10172,Howard,"yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
10174,Howard,why is it your last name and her first name?
8127,Howard,"shh, shh. listen to me. i’m not gonna make it."
10177,Howard,"hey, what if i took your class?"
8130,Howard,you take this one. i spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
8134,Howard,"okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
10192,Howard,"if you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then i’m gonna be a crappy student.  uh, uh, ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause i never been defeated and i won’t stop now…"
10196,Howard,is that gonna be on the test? because i don’t think i can do that again.
8151,Howard,this is perfect. i hope this moment never ends.
8152,Howard,"well, gotta go."
8159,Howard,i’ve got a better solution.
10212,Howard,cut it out. you’re hurting my feelings.
8166,Howard,that’s it. i don’t have to take this. good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
10215,Howard,they’re doing space day and nasa asked me. i felt like i couldn’t say no.
10216,Howard,"thank you, that would be great."
8169,Howard,big fight with my mother.
8172,Howard,there’s no room. his sister is staying with him.
8177,Howard,"that’s very nice of you, but i made other plans."
8178,Howard,hey.
8182,Howard,"oh, uh…"
8183,Howard,"no, wait. you didn’t let me finish."
10230,Howard,but it’s for a good cause. what about all the kids that’ll be there?
8188,Howard,"i love you, too. so what’s for dinner?"
10239,Howard,"okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about mars."
16386,Leonard,"something’s wrong, i’m not getting any gas. anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
16401,Leonard,oh. that’s too bad. i wonder what happened.
16403,Leonard,"– priya, can i come in?"
16414,Leonard,really? who?
16415,Leonard,what? you’re kidding!
16425,Leonard,"well, the point is, if this got out, it would destroy howard and raj’s friendship."
16434,Leonard,hey.
16446,Leonard,"i can’t hear you, i’m in the shower."
16449,Leonard,what kind of emergency?
16456,Leonard,schooled!
16458,Leonard,"no offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
16464,Leonard,"uh, captain kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
16468,Leonard,are you ashamed of me?
16472,Leonard,this is ridiculous. 
16477,Leonard,"that, that’s brilliant."
16503,Leonard,i think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
16505,Leonard,"oh, oh, beekeeper to king 12. i capture your pope and release the swarm. checkmate on sheldon."
16513,Leonard,water nymph.
16516,Leonard,that’s not your water.
16517,Leonard,"howard and his mother are at the hospital. come on, we gotta go."
16522,Leonard,go sit over there.
16527,Leonard,"no, i do not. you are a mean little man."
16528,Leonard,"there are a couple of things i did with penny that might be a little silly, but…"
16529,Leonard,"every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, i’d put on a little show for her."
16533,Leonard,there was one time i put body glitter on.
16535,Leonard,you really are a mean little man.
16548,Leonard,"so, howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as mr. and dr. wolowitz?"
16552,Leonard,in my bed?
16557,Leonard,"okay, well, how about this. until priya gets her own place, you stay here and i’ll stay at your apartment."
16559,Leonard,just not against their will.
16561,Leonard,"if you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
16567,Leonard,sorry.
16568,Leonard,"oh, come on! why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
16570,Leonard,fine.
16571,Leonard,you’re moving back to india?
16573,Leonard,she’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
16575,Leonard,so. hot in india?
16579,Leonard,priya’s going back to india.
16582,Leonard,what are you grinding about?
16587,Leonard,"no, i’m fine with it."
16588,Leonard,what the hell is wrong with you?
16594,Leonard,i don’t want to talk to amy.
16595,Leonard,you called my mother?
16602,Leonard,"hang on, sheldon. how could you not tell me your sister was moving back to india?"
16617,Leonard,"listen, i don’t want to be rude, but priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
16618,Leonard,"yes, i’ve always admired that about you."
16619,Leonard,"oh, good."
16621,Leonard,"you know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. they’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
16626,Leonard,"oh, i miss you, too."
16637,Leonard,it’s like living with a chihuahua.
16638,Leonard,"so, here we are. back in bed together."
16640,Leonard,"uh, you’re a naughty girl. and, and, uh, i, i want to punish you with my love?"
16644,Leonard,why don’t you just give me five minutes? i’ll google how to do this. i’ll call you right back.
16648,Leonard,"taking shorts off. there we go. naked, naked, naked!"
16650,Leonard,"oh, damn it!"
16660,Leonard,who wants the last dumpling?
16665,Leonard,amy?
16666,Leonard,you okay?
16669,Leonard,"what, who told you that?"
16672,Leonard,not really. is that my yearbook?
16674,Leonard,aw.
16675,Leonard,"rough night, casey jones?"
16687,Leonard,"okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
16696,Leonard,not bad. i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would.
16698,Leonard,what?
16699,Leonard,"hey, how go the wedding plans, howard?"
16701,Leonard,maybe. we enter the dungeon.
16710,Leonard,deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
16733,Leonard,thank you.
16740,Leonard,"i’d like to propose a toast. the dream to go up into space is one we all share, and howard’s making that a reality. we’re all very proud of you."
16741,Leonard,thank you.
16743,Leonard,"for god’s sake, will you stop with the schrodinger stuff."
16747,Leonard,going to wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
16749,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, we’re going to wil’s. this is your last chance."
16752,Leonard,"no, i just got a text from stuart. brent spiner is at the party."
16758,Leonard,can we get autographed dolls?
16764,Leonard,"sheldon, she just got off the plane. she doesn’t want to cook."
16765,Leonard,"all right, that settles it, we’re going out. do you like sushi? there’s a great little place down the street."
16769,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, that, too."
16770,Leonard,"it’s kind of like the loch ness monster. maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. we’ll probably never know. but sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
16778,Leonard,"no, regular."
16780,Leonard,everything? aren’t you worried about your health?
16784,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, we say catholics, not rosary rattlers."
16789,Leonard,hang on. looks like everyone’s a winner.
16792,Leonard,"uh, yeah. it’s issue number 21. first appearance of hellboy."
16798,Leonard,"sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. what’s that word?"
16801,Leonard,how many times are you gonna tell me? what’s with you?
16815,Leonard,thanks.
16820,Leonard,"so, you’re okay talking about this?"
16830,Leonard,"oh, that’s not who i am."
16836,Leonard,"hey, well, see you. i’m going out. "
16843,Leonard,do you mind? i’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
16845,Leonard,"damn it, i can’t. i can’t, i can’t do this."
16849,Leonard,"wait, i don’t, which part?"
16851,Leonard,it’s okay. did the right thing. you idiot!
16857,Leonard,"uh, kind of?"
16864,Leonard,"no, it’s not gonna do it."
16865,Leonard,"leonard’s coming down the home stretch! come on, horsey, you can do this! damn. come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! yes! first place. i would have been a great jockey if i weren’t too tall. and scared of horses. sheldon, you’re up."
16867,Leonard,did you try calling her on the telephone?
16868,Leonard,"if you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
16870,Leonard,you do?
16875,Leonard,for all those girls out there looking for the indian monopoly man?
16879,Leonard,"yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
16880,Leonard,her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
16881,Leonard,"hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
16886,Leonard,"amy, what are you doing here?"
16888,Leonard,maybe we should get you home.
16896,Leonard,really? do we do that?
16901,Leonard,"movies, yes."
16902,Leonard,"sheldon, just ignore him."
16911,Leonard,can’t argue with that. i’ll get the tickets.
16917,Leonard,"does this sound familiar? i’d love to go shoe shopping with you. hiking? it’s great. it’s two a.m., of course i want to go to korea town and sing karaoke with your friends. who wouldn’t?"
16921,Leonard,"come on, you enjoyed the movie. i saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
16930,Leonard,you’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because i said we weren’t on a date.
16931,Leonard,"come on, he’s not that cute."
16942,Leonard,that’s kind of between me and…
16945,Leonard,"when you were telling kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as waitress in a local production of the cheesecake factory?"
16950,Leonard,"just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
16955,Leonard,i am such an asthmatic dumbass. i had a weird night.
16959,Leonard,sure. i guess.
16967,Leonard,really?
16973,Leonard,yeah.
16974,Leonard,we should go easy on him. amy’s out with stuart tonight.
17020,Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
17022,Leonard,it wasn’t fun for me.
17026,Leonard,yes.
17028,Leonard,you got one for good luck.  i’ll get it.
17030,Leonard,laxative.
17033,Leonard,"well, yeah, thanks, jimmy."
17034,Leonard,are you okay to drive?
17035,Leonard,"no, no, no, come on in. i’ll make you a cup of coffee."
17040,Leonard,yeah. it kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
17041,Leonard,yeah.
17044,Leonard,"yeah, you did. so, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. and , and, and thanks for the apology."
17055,Leonard,"next time, you should open with that."
17059,Leonard,you want to talk about it?
17061,Leonard,glad i was sitting down for that. did you and amy get in a fight?
17067,Leonard,glad i could help.
17068,Leonard,"there you go, howard. sounds like raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
17069,Leonard,what are you gonna do?
17076,Leonard,"excuse me, amy. penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
17082,Leonard,"oh, boy, do i?"
17086,Leonard,"so, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
17088,Leonard,"hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? see how that goes."
17093,Leonard,"not some kind of nerd, i am the king of the nerds."
17094,Leonard,"uh, it means if anyone displeases me, i don’t help them set up their printer."
17095,Leonard,good. remember that when i take my shirt off.
17102,Leonard,"no, it’s not. always made it worse."
17107,Leonard,you’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
17113,Leonard,"well, there was a lot at stake."
17115,Leonard,"well, i’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
17118,Leonard,"well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? it could be more like a new version of software. penny and leonard 2.0. we can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
17119,Leonard,exactly. we pretend like our date went badly.
17121,Leonard,i can’t believe you kept this.
17122,Leonard,that is so sweet. in 25 to 30 minutes i’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
17124,Leonard,"well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
17125,Leonard,"yeah, well, so was i."
17127,Leonard,"the, the gas station across the street."
17129,Leonard,yes.
17136,Leonard,fine.
17155,Leonard,"excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
17158,Leonard,"well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. have you ever tried it?"
17159,Leonard,"oh, i can take it slow. did i ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, karen berberick? to this day she doesn’t know we were going out. made it easier on her when i broke things off."
17163,Leonard,"no, you should. absolutely. that was me being pedantic. that’s our first bug. you reported it. i can fix that. see? this is good."
17167,Leonard,even doctor who?
17174,Leonard,"look at that. some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
17176,Leonard,can you finish it later?
17183,Leonard,"right. sorry, sorry."
17186,Leonard,"so, i’ve got a gunshot wound. that’s pretty badass."
17187,Leonard,hello? they gave me a band-aid. hospitals do not issue band-aids unless it is medically necessary. that is the law.
17188,Leonard,thank you for hiding my star wars socks at the emergency room. is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
17192,Leonard,i have to get a lock for my door.
17193,Leonard,"sheldon, canada is not going to invade california."
17198,Leonard,because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
17199,Leonard,uh-huh.
17204,Leonard,i don’t care. i’m done.
17217,Leonard,what happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
17219,Leonard,to wine and bubble wrap. and to not having to watch sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
17227,Leonard,"no, he’s crazy. sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
17230,Leonard,"listen, sheldon, this is stupid. i don’t see why we can’t be friends. and i’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. i just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
17232,Leonard,you say thank you.
17240,Leonard,five.
17245,Leonard,"that tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, i got my money, let’s spend it up…"
17254,Leonard,hey.
17265,Leonard,"hey, howard, i need to tell you something."
17266,Leonard,"uh, listen, i heard that bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
17268,Leonard,what choice did the university have? he snapped. it happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
17275,Leonard,"all right, this is one-on-one. first person to five wins the office. any questions? yes, sheldon?"
17284,Leonard,"congratulations, sheldon. you win office."
17292,Leonard,i’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. i’ll pick you up when you’re done.
17298,Leonard,"when you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
17299,Leonard,sure. what are you doing?
17305,Leonard,"like i said, complicated game."
17309,Leonard,"oh, uh, he’s crazy."
17310,Leonard,good. i’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
17330,Leonard,"all right, let’s do it."
17336,Leonard,"hey, listen, i kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then i wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if i should have asked you first. then i thought if i did check with you first, you’d think that i was taking things to seriously. and then, then i got a nosebleed."
17337,Leonard,"oh. i guess i was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
17346,Leonard,"uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, i think raj beat you to it."
17353,Leonard,"sure, what’s up?"
17361,Leonard,awesome!
17365,Leonard,what?
17369,Leonard,it’s broken.
17370,Leonard,absolutely.
17373,Leonard,"okay, that i believe."
17374,Leonard,"so, is that one mine."
17380,Leonard,"boy, a restraining order from stephen hawking. it’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from leonard nimoy, carl sagan and stan lee."
17381,Leonard,like it was ten hours ago. what about it?
17384,Leonard,"so, come on, how was the first day with hawking?"
17390,Leonard,give it a second. 
17401,Leonard,"oh, i will. there is no telling what might happen."
17411,Leonard,"wow, that’s very nice."
17413,Leonard,"so, howard wolowitz tying the knot. leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. he was a wild one. well, i guess we all kind of were. i remember this one time, i was with this girl at the beach. we were in the ocean and we started making out. i know, it was crazy. i wasn’t even wearing my aquasocks. then…"
17415,Leonard,i totally had sex in the ocean.
17418,Leonard,"no, uh, that, that’s it. i don’t know much about women. raj, you got anything?"
17424,Leonard,"no, it should be: why are you?"
17431,Leonard,check it out. it’s the gas i use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. but it also has an interesting secondary use. here. breathe this in.
17432,Leonard,just try it.
17433,Leonard,i have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
17435,Leonard,"oh, great."
17436,Leonard,"and i promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
17441,Leonard,it was the heat of the moment.
17444,Leonard,"okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. why don’t we just start doing that now?"
17448,Leonard,"are you? you left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
17450,Leonard,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i screwed things up pretty good with penny."
17451,Leonard,"i guess we are. so, what’s going on?"
17453,Leonard,shame on her.
17454,Leonard,she’s good.
17455,Leonard,"you mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
17457,Leonard,yeah.
17459,Leonard,hey. off to work?
17464,Leonard,is it still weird ’cause i proposed?
17471,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, it’ll be fun."
17480,Leonard,i doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
17484,Leonard,"hey, i didn’t say it."
17485,Leonard,"thank you, amy. very touching. howard and bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. and that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
17489,Leonard,"you know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. the water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine."
17493,Leonard,where do you stand on it? 
17495,Leonard,hey.
17504,Leonard,"so, where exactly are we in this relationship?"
17505,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m sorry. let’s watch the game. "
17509,Leonard,what are you doing here? i thought you were out with sheldon and amy.
17516,Leonard,okay.
17519,Leonard,go ahead.
17524,Leonard,maybe your tongue is shrinking.
17529,Leonard,what is it?
17532,Leonard,"the guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires."
17538,Leonard,"yes, you walked around for a week saying, sheldon unhappy with casting choice."
17542,Leonard,"yup. i told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, i’d take him for ice cream."
17549,Leonard,"no, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track."
17554,Leonard,"if you want help, just hire a grad student."
17569,Leonard,"no. but compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity."
17575,Leonard,"no, raj had to go to the nurse."
17579,Leonard,"magnets: what do they stick to? if the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking."
17584,Leonard,"batman. batman and robin. uh, wonder twins plus the monkey. wonder twins plus the monkey and batman."
17593,Leonard,"i don’t know, uh, casper the alcoholic ghost?"
17612,Leonard,"hey, what are you doing here?"
17615,Leonard,nope. now the lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
17618,Leonard,sign right there.
17621,Leonard,it’s actually pretty neat.
17622,Leonard,"yeah. it’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. here, i’ll show you. we’ll just put this pencil over here."
17623,Leonard,"very good. and then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. "
17624,Leonard,"you know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."
17626,Leonard,what?
17630,Leonard,"no. i did have a shot with the lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough."
17637,Leonard,but what i really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
17638,Leonard,"hello, boys."
17642,Leonard,"don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs."
17643,Leonard,"that’s really nice, sheldon, i’m happy for you."
17648,Leonard,"why do you think i’d be like that? i get it, you’re taking one class. it’s nice. maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."
17652,Leonard,can i take a look?
17654,Leonard,"it’s like when i started doing chin-ups, i didn’t want you to see until i could do one. fyi, really close."
17656,Leonard,please be good. please be good. uh-huh. uh-huh. okay. she writes like she cooks.
17658,Leonard,i did a bad thing.
17663,Leonard,"hang on. okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. chess clock. we each get five minutes to talk about our problems. we’ll take turns. each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. begin."
17667,Leonard,no. you need to give me some advice.
17676,Leonard,don’t ask me. a little elf did it.
17677,Leonard,"no, i assumed it would be good. then i read it."
17680,Leonard,"please don’t be upset. i just, i didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."
17681,Leonard,"oh, come on, you know that’s not true."
17685,Leonard,i don’t know what to say.
17692,Leonard,"buddy, i think amy might be upset."
17693,Leonard,"because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him."
17713,Leonard,"say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. england sucks, you suck, usa number one."
17715,Leonard,what did he say?
17716,Leonard,what?
17718,Leonard,"come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you."
17719,Leonard,really? here?
17720,Leonard,that’d be great. thank you.
17726,Leonard,i’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
17732,Leonard,"you, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?"
17740,Leonard,"hey, alex, let me ask you something. my girlfriend knows this guy at school. he’s got an english accent."
17746,Leonard,hi.
17750,Leonard,"oh. you know, i’m really starting to not like this guy."
17754,Leonard,"you’re right, you should go."
17756,Leonard,your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. you’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
17761,Leonard,"you get a cookie, too."
17769,Leonard,"howard, what are you doing?"
17774,Leonard,"why would it trouble you? it’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
17777,Leonard,fun. we know how much you love that.
17778,Leonard,that should lighten the mood.
17785,Leonard,"you know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
17787,Leonard,"aw, i got a little paper cut."
17796,Leonard,"fine. howard, what do you do?"
17801,Leonard,"oh, uh, yeah. i got ’em on amazon."
17804,Leonard,great. what do you do?
17827,Leonard,"okay. so wolowitz and stuart are paralyzed, santa’s dead, and i picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
17828,Leonard,i can’t blame you. tiny twister was a complete bust.
17830,Leonard,hey. just playing a little giant jenga here.
17834,Leonard,"well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff."
17840,Leonard,"to my bones. i mean, i’m not gonna do anything about it. i love penny. it’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods."
17844,Leonard,"hey, pretty lady."
17846,Leonard,"i don’t know, just having a good day. this morning sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so i got to listen to the radio. that was pretty crazy."
17852,Leonard,what?
17861,Leonard,"no, i’m not happy."
17878,Leonard,"to my bedroom, so i can take everything off but those glasses. and maybe the boots."
17879,Leonard,"hey, will you steam my uniform next?"
17891,Leonard,really?
17894,Leonard,i’ll set the timer.
17896,Leonard,i don’t believe this.
17905,Leonard,can i use your phone? our car got stolen.
17906,Leonard,"our clothes, our wallets, phones."
17907,Leonard,"uh, we’re going to the comic-con in bakersfield. they have a big costume contest. it’s cooler than it sounds."
17914,Leonard,"sheldon, your food’s getting cold."
17916,Leonard,"yeah, so, i’m out."
17920,Leonard,a thousand dollars on action figures? how can you afford that?
17922,Leonard,yeah. maybe wesley snipes and toucan sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
17928,Leonard,want me to make you some tea?
17929,Leonard,"so, cocoa?"
17936,Leonard,"sheldon, kripke’s not smarter than you. you just got stuck on a wrong path. happened to einstein. he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."
17937,Leonard,"sheldon lee cooper, i do not have time for this nonsense. now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work."
17940,Leonard,"i know you’re joking, but i’d be okay with that."
17948,Leonard,"what is wrong with you? if i did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks."
17955,Leonard,i don’t care. i don’t have to do anything you say because i don’t think i want to live here anymore.
17959,Leonard,"i swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being i have ever met."
17960,Leonard,"well, i’ve had it. i am done. i can’t, i can’t live with him for one more minute."
17963,Leonard,he’s got amy now.
17965,Leonard,harry and ginny get together?
17969,Leonard,yeah.
17971,Leonard,"oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? i take a lot of medicine."
17980,Leonard,‘kay.
17982,Leonard,hmm?
17992,Leonard,"oh, that’s cool."
17998,Leonard,"mmm, would you like some wine?"
18014,Leonard,"okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
18025,Leonard,and i’m cool with surprises. but nothing on a jumbotron. i don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
18034,Leonard,"yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."
18037,Leonard,i don’t know.
18048,Leonard,helping women? y
18059,Leonard,"that’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there."
18063,Leonard,"alright, alright. boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? thank you, astronaut howard. um, i am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because i get to test theories and work with lasers. yes?"
18066,Leonard,"hey, how was your… what?"
18075,Leonard,yeah. although…
18077,Leonard,"i’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. penny and i just want to do something low-key. you know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres."
18081,Leonard,"fine, then that."
18094,Leonard,"well, one of them is."
18099,Leonard,"oh, my god."
18103,Leonard,"mm, not really."
18106,Leonard,i’m not gonna schmooze anybody. i’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
18131,Leonard,"well, well, well, sheldon, fancy meeting you here. i guess the train store in glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. and you, you said you weren’t coming here, either."
18133,Leonard,way to hit ’em with both barrels.
18137,Leonard,"how about it, sheldon?"
18143,Leonard,they did.
18144,Leonard,"oh, please, don’t do that."
18147,Leonard,i thought you grew up on a farm.
18148,Leonard,"so, did you love it? of course you loved it. how could you not love it? tell me how much you loved it."
18150,Leonard,it just makes things seem small. it diminishes them.
18155,Leonard,really?
18156,Leonard,"all right, cool. i think you’ll like the next one better. all the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
18165,Leonard,he was the host of this great… hey!
18169,Leonard,do you remember his old theme song?
18170,Leonard,you’re kidding.
18171,Leonard,and he wrote him a cheque.
18177,Leonard,no.
18178,Leonard,"okay, good night."
18181,Leonard,"mr. jeffries, i am so sorry. we should’ve told you about the broken elevator."
18182,Leonard,"actually, he’s a genius."
18184,Leonard,"yes, sir."
18191,Leonard,you want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
18193,Leonard,it’s gonna get crazy.
18194,Leonard,"i’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma."
18196,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice. but relax, sometimes change is good. uh, you were worried about zachary quinto being the new spock, but you wound up liking him."
18197,Leonard,"see, howard’s just as good a dungeon master as i am."
18200,Leonard,"hey, i always did sound effects. a-a swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. "
18203,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
18210,Leonard,"hey, you guys have been in there for a while. you doing okay?"
18218,Leonard,interesting that you would bring that up when i might go work on a boat.
18219,Leonard,i know what you’re doing. you don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
18227,Leonard,couple of weeks.
18231,Leonard,okay. i’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
18232,Leonard,i do have to ask you one favour.
18235,Leonard,"really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
18236,Leonard,"there’s beer in the fridge. anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
18239,Leonard,yeah.
18243,Leonard,yep. i’m really gonna miss you.
18244,Leonard,"anyway, we can e-mail, and i think the phone connections are pretty good."
18249,Leonard,"i love you, too."
18252,Leonard,so?
18253,Leonard,"sheldon, i got to go inside. it’s getting rough out here."
18262,Leonard,"we finished the experiment early, so i thought i’d come home and surprise you."
18267,Leonard,yep. here’s some money.
18274,Leonard,"come on, this is silly. hey, um, i brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? it’s that sailor cap that you wanted. it’s neat, huh?"
18276,Leonard,good morning.
18280,Leonard,"no, i don’t."
18283,Leonard,"hey, i said i was sorry. what else do you want from me?"
18291,Leonard,"i thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
18301,Leonard,what’s all this?
18304,Leonard,ha-ha.
18313,Leonard,"hey, penny, i just wanted to say good luck, and i hope there’s no hard feelings."
18321,Leonard,why?
18322,Leonard,what does she think i am?
18326,Leonard,got it.
18329,Leonard,the clue must be in the bag.
18334,Leonard,"hey, i am every bit as much of a man as penny. now, let’s do this."
18346,Leonard,"actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because indy had the medallion. without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
18350,Leonard,"okay, fine. do you want to know why i dressed like the hulk? because i was always mad at my mom and i wanted to smash my way out of that house."
18365,Leonard,no. not everything is about my mom. 
18372,Leonard,who just had sex with me at work.
18378,Leonard,"uh-huh, i can already feel it working."
18383,Leonard,"penny, come back. i’m sad for real now."
18386,Leonard,"no, no, i think it’ll be great. maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. giant baby."
18392,Leonard,hey.
18397,Leonard,i thought amy was gonna drive you home.
18404,Leonard,it’s really sweet what howard wants to do for bernadette.
18409,Leonard,it’s fine. and also not true.
18416,Leonard,"if by cool you mean willing to, yes. if by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
18419,Leonard,"oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. look at me with you. "
18424,Leonard,invite them to live with us.
18428,Leonard,"oh, my god, is she okay?"
18429,Leonard,"oh, no."
18432,Leonard,"oh, rose petals."
18434,Leonard,"oh, wow."
18438,Leonard,"no, no, it’s okay. it’s really thoughtful."
18444,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
18446,Leonard,he thinks there’s a difference.
18448,Leonard,"no, she’s not."
18451,Leonard,what’s up?
18465,Leonard,"look, i know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. it’s just how he is. but he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
18466,Leonard,"he did bite me once. but in his defence, i came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
18469,Leonard,"no, i have to go pick him up. bill nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
18472,Leonard,"oh, uh, we played, once. i broke a window."
18475,Leonard,"uh, if i still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
18480,Leonard,"no, no, no, i, i looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
18481,Leonard,"okay, okay. i’m gonna show you what’s in the box. but just promise not to flip out."
18490,Leonard,that’s stupid. why?
18507,Leonard,"oh, oh, no, no. it’s because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held. according to father solakian, no one attended. luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. i lit a candle and prayed for your death but i’m not armenian, so it probably won’t work. this is over, right?"
18508,Leonard,"listen to me, sheldon. i am not going to lebanon to return super mario brothers the movie."
18510,Leonard,what?
18511,Leonard,what?
18519,Leonard,"wait, you went to a chapel?"
18520,Leonard,why? 
18544,Leonard,you’re the one who invited him here.
18548,Leonard,"hey, you’re in a good mood."
18551,Leonard,yes. do you know what that means? that means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
18571,Leonard,as i was saying…
18578,Leonard,"all right, here’s the deal. sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
18585,Leonard, what do you think?
18586,Leonard,you don’t know that. i’ve been going to the cheesecake factory for years. i could have picked her up.  
18587,Leonard,no.
18588,Leonard,i’m gonna do it. i’m gonna ask her out.
18590,Leonard,"i, uh, ah, um, i…"
18592,Leonard,i will. excuse me.
18596,Leonard,"come on, i would not have peed my pants."
18601,Leonard,the end.
18616,Leonard,absolutely.
18619,Leonard,that’s amazing.
18628,Leonard,are you set on people laughing with you? ‘cause if you’re cool with at you…
18630,Leonard,"i know, but you’re going to be a tv star and you haven’t left me yet. that takes guts."
18636,Leonard,"oh, come on, no, that’s not what i meant."
18640,Leonard,yes.
18643,Leonard,"i don’t know, i got all confused when you said honestly."
18644,Leonard,"look, do i think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? of course i do. but isn’t los angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? all right, look, we’ll come back to that."
18646,Leonard,should’ve let sheldon come.
18652,Leonard,"so? even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
18654,Leonard,"yeah, i’ll call you back."
18659,Leonard,"well, you have me."
18664,Leonard,really not a good time.
18667,Leonard,no.
18679,Leonard,"okay, listen, i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but i’m a little distracted right now."
18683,Leonard,okay.
18685,Leonard,"no, no, no, no. i take it back. don’t say it. just, just hate me, but stay with me. it worked for my parents."
18695,Leonard,no.
18696,Leonard,no.
18699,Leonard,yeah.
18715,Leonard,"listen, i could never do what you’re doing, okay? i would be terrified."
18728,Leonard,"sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
18729,Leonard,do what you want. we’re getting scalped tickets.
18730,Leonard,the same way i know that the people in the tv set can’t see me.
18733,Leonard,"sheldon, buddy, i just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
18735,Leonard,"mmm, what if we go as the fantastic four, and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us."
18739,Leonard,"well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
18746,Leonard,name one.
18756,Leonard,"thank you. seriously, please don’t make me go."
18761,Leonard,"it’s a little late, but i’ll take it."
18765,Leonard,"well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. "
18776,Leonard,yeah.
18799,Leonard,no. sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
18807,Leonard,we’re not.
18809,Leonard,oh. this is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
18813,Leonard,"you’re too close to it, but amy has had a huge impact on you."
18825,Leonard,why would you do that?
18828,Leonard,"i don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, i’m sure you know what you’re doing."
18836,Leonard,"let’s get this over with. am i driving you to the cheesecake factory, or are we having sex? i’m just, i’m trying to lighten the mood."
18840,Leonard,i know. i thought we’d take yours.
18849,Leonard,"oh, come on."
18851,Leonard,"oh, no, no. that’s clarence darrow. it’s from a game sheldon made up called chutes and lawyers. you slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
18855,Leonard,"oh, does the gazelle know that according to harlan ellison, it was not ripped off from demon with a glass hand, but was ripped off from another outer limits script he wrote called the soldier?"
18863,Leonard,aw.
18868,Leonard,if only there were a solution to that.
18869,Leonard,so go to the bathroom.
18872,Leonard,why did i pee before i decided to move in here?
18873,Leonard,"hey. oh, how’d the audition go?"
18875,Leonard,aren’t you gonna ask?
18879,Leonard,what does your agent think?
18886,Leonard,ps4.
18890,Leonard,were you seeing other men?
18893,Leonard,"so, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
18894,Leonard,sounds rough.
18908,Leonard,"that doesn’t work any more. he just thinks i’m taking him to the doctor. so, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
18913,Leonard,one of the people that lives in his head.
18915,Leonard,how you feeling?
18917,Leonard,i don’t know. i heard you reading pretty loud last night.
18919,Leonard,what?
18925,Leonard,hey. how about we bring back anything can happen thursdays?
18928,Leonard,i’m starting to remember the problem with anything can happen thursdays.
18929,Leonard,what can we do that’s different?
18934,Leonard,that’s not what i meant.
18943,Leonard,"oh, doesn’t seem like it. she got sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
18957,Leonard,"anyway, the, the funeral’s on sunday."
18958,Leonard,"yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. you okay? i know he meant a lot to you."
18964,Leonard,i know.
18965,Leonard,"oh that’s, that’s fine. go ahead."
18967,Leonard,i am not a crybaby.
18969,Leonard,i got your back.
18980,Leonard,"i proposed twice, you proposed once. two to one."
18982,Leonard,"yeah, i think i would."
18986,Leonard,"ooh, interesting. did you just propose to me again?"
18995,Leonard,"hey, how were things on the set?"
18998,Leonard,"whoa, whoa, hang on. there’s no need to insult her."
19012,Leonard,"why? because i’m a, a smart decision?"
19013,Leonard,so i’m like a bran muffin.
19018,Leonard,then what do you need?
19022,Leonard,all right.
19039,Leonard,"thanks, mom."
19042,Leonard,oh. how’s it going?
19049,Leonard,that’s very sweet. but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
19057,Leonard,it’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
19063,Leonard,"well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. i’m sure he’s fine. he probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
19067,Leonard,"oh, i know his password, so i can track his phone."
19075,Leonard,seriously? you don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
19086,Leonard,okay. good luck.
19094,Leonard,"hey, buddy. good to hear your voice."
19104,Leonard,"oh, right."
19106,Leonard,"come on, you didn’t even try."
19111,Leonard,how were they?
19125,Leonard,the kids are gonna love him.
19129,Leonard,"well, that’s not your fault."
19133,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you doing this?"
19135,Leonard,"you want to know what i think? i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it."
19136,Leonard,might be something to think about.
19153,Leonard,"there isn’t any ranking. and if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it."
19157,Leonard,"yeah, toddlers do that."
19158,Leonard,you believe this guy? he has to be the best at everything.
19164,Leonard,"so, this is accurate?"
19168,Leonard,come on. it’ll be fun.
19177,Leonard,i killed his chewbacca slippers.
19180,Leonard,"marriage is scary. you’re scared, i’m scared. but it doesn’t make me not want to do it. it, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
19182,Leonard,"on our quidditch team, he…"
19183,Leonard,have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken dna to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
19184,Leonard,yeah. i’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
19187,Leonard,what happens if she doesn’t like us?
19192,Leonard,"hey, here’s a thought. why don’t we put up the rest of the money that stuart needs?"
19205,Leonard,there’s something i wanted to run past you.
19219,Leonard,"hey. so, the guys and i are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. i just wanted to know if that’s okay. you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday."
19223,Leonard,"guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch tv."
19232,Leonard,had will have placed?
19244,Leonard,"all right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…"
19247,Leonard,thank you. and now i owe you one.
19248,Leonard,everyone stop. this was a stupid idea. negative reinforcement isn’t working.
19260,Leonard,hmm.
19265,Leonard,you’re right.
19266,Leonard,doesn’t sound that bad.
19271,Leonard,"i know, and i’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean i can’t do something nice. like this."
19285,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sorry, too. we’re about to share the rest of our lives together. it’s our money, who cares who has it?"
19290,Leonard,"i usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
19296,Leonard,"i’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. me neither, leonard. it’s my first time, too."
19306,Leonard,i think so.
19307,Leonard,excuse me?
19313,Leonard,i don’t know that i’d call myself an infection.
19319,Leonard,why?
19321,Leonard,"no. i got upset. and sheldon made me a beverage, too."
19324,Leonard,"all right, i’ll get rid of him. but you owe me one."
19332,Leonard,"uh, guys, we’re locked in here."
19339,Leonard,"i know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with stuart."
19341,Leonard,but the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. it doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
19347,Leonard,bruce wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
19350,Leonard,was that a flask?
19351,Leonard,you’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
19362,Leonard,"oh, it’s all right. we ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…"
19377,Leonard,"okay, why?"
19380,Leonard,"it sounds like either way, i finally get some rest."
19385,Leonard,great timing. my check sphincter light just went on.
19386,Leonard,i’m not allergic to latex.
19389,Leonard,"sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
19401,Leonard,"oh, what’d you get?"
19410,Leonard,this has to mean something.
19413,Leonard,"because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
19428,Leonard,sad?
19429,Leonard,yeah. what did they say?
19430,Leonard,congratulations.
19447,Leonard,"what about when you flipped the mars rover, or lost koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
19448,Leonard,"fine, put the slim jim in the garbage bag."
19450,Leonard,oh. genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a slim jim.
19452,Leonard,"no, no, no. no, raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
19454,Leonard,do you want the fire extinguisher?
19464,Leonard,i don’t know. there’s still a bird in here. we are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
19465,Leonard,"no, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
19466,Leonard,i can’t do that.
19468,Leonard,yeah.
19470,Leonard,"well, i’d like to be green, but you know you always take it."
19471,Leonard,blue and yellow make green.
19477,Leonard,"you got it, you girls are in charge."
19479,Leonard,"hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
19485,Leonard,"well, yeah."
19487,Leonard,"uh, i’ve got some bad news. there’s no cell service in here."
19488,Leonard,that’s true.
19489,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s fine."
19490,Leonard,"okay. and to defend, i roll two sixes. i win."
19496,Leonard,what? then. then why don’t you do it?
19502,Leonard,"sheldon, i, i’m sorry if i hurt your feelings. i’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
19504,Leonard,"come on, don’t get upset."
19506,Leonard,i’m not leaving your world. i’m just talking about living across the hall.
19514,Leonard,"well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start."
19525,Leonard,"ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
19533,Leonard,"howard’s right, that’ll never work."
19535,Leonard,what is going on?
19540,Leonard,here we are.
19546,Leonard,"wow, you remember that?"
19552,Leonard,which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. so what do you think? what do you think? so what do you think?
19569,Leonard,"okay, partner, let’s do it."
19572,Leonard,is your tongue blue?
19574,Leonard,no.
19576,Leonard,"let me see, let me see. one calls it insightful and innovative. we’re insightful and innovative."
19580,Leonard,"uh, don’t lower yourself to their level."
19586,Leonard,read it back one more time.
19590,Leonard,what did you write?
19591,Leonard,what does that mean?
19595,Leonard,"all right, do it. call him. let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished."
19598,Leonard,"and you as well, mr. our-premise-is-intriguing."
19607,Leonard,"hi, we’re here to pick up an order for comic center."
19611,Leonard,"i don’t know. i mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
19628,Leonard,buddy.
19631,Leonard,let’s have a toast. to mrs. wolowitz. a loving mother to all of us. we’ll miss you.
19636,Leonard,"well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
19637,Leonard,"yeah, sure, that might be fun."
19650,Leonard,i bet the key’s behind it.
19652,Leonard,"i was unstoppable. i mean, i was, i was on fire. it was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone."
19655,Leonard,hey.
19656,Leonard,okay.
19661,Leonard,"hey, hey. listen, i, i have a little confession to make."
19665,Leonard,yeah?
19670,Leonard,"okay, but it’s a drive, the one i went to is in san diego."
19672,Leonard,"maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
19678,Leonard,"well, we did it."
19683,Leonard,"god, i love you. i love you so much."
19690,Leonard,sheldon.
19691,Leonard,really?
19696,Leonard,it’s kind of a big deal.
19700,Leonard,oh.
19706,Leonard,thank you. what did he say?
19709,Leonard,no.
19725,Leonard,"right now, i’m just trying to burp without throwing up."
19726,Leonard,"oh, i like to laugh. but say it anyway."
19742,Leonard,"if we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
19745,Leonard,"we do have time. i mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
19747,Leonard,wasn’t even that hard to find.
19748,Leonard,i know. you want to get a picture?
19751,Leonard,"okay, yeah. what do we have to lose? i’m a little nervous."
19752,Leonard,right.
19759,Leonard,"we don’t have an appointment. we, we’re just fans of mr. lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
19760,Leonard,"i’m sorry, don’t listen to him. we’re actually physicists. we’re giving a lecture at berkeley later today. we just, we had some time to kill."
19764,Leonard,"uh-huh, i’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
19765,Leonard,we understand. thank you so much.
19766,Leonard,"yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee."
19772,Leonard,i know.
19773,Leonard,i guess this could count as an adventure.
19775,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, i’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist."
19777,Leonard,"i was gonna say or, but why bother?"
19789,Leonard,"stay out of it, kevin smith."
19790,Leonard,"no, no, no. we’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation."
19794,Leonard,i’m just trying to protect you. how many times did i see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
19811,Leonard,"yeah, i’m good."
19822,Leonard,my mommy raised a gentleman.
19830,Leonard,i don’t know. should we call sheldon and howard?
19838,Leonard,"it’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. i mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
19842,Leonard,all we have to do is rig up a 3-d communication system.
19845,Leonard,hey.
19848,Leonard,how is that building on what he just said?
19855,Leonard,"i’m just saying, sometimes raj and i feel pushed aside."
19860,Leonard,how would i be blinded?
19864,Leonard,why did you need a belt?
19865,Leonard,it gets a bad rap from shows like jersey shore and real housewives.
19866,Leonard,"no, it’s like that. well, i’m excited to show you around."
19872,Leonard,"oh, thank you, but i’m okay."
19876,Leonard,a cap and gown? why do i need a cap and gown?
19879,Leonard,"short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse."
19899,Leonard,east texas.
19904,Leonard,"you mean, my hypothesis. i hypothesized it all by myself."
19907,Leonard,we did not. that’s not true. can i speak to you alone for a second?
19924,Leonard,hey.
19931,Leonard,really good.
19944,Leonard,shut up.
19946,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not a whiner."
19948,Leonard,"yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together."
19955,Leonard,it is. it is about us.
19960,Leonard,"okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
19963,Leonard,"and then nothing. i stopped it. but it still bothers me, and i wanted you to know."
19964,Leonard,did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
19970,Leonard,"i can do that. uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it."
19971,Leonard,yeah?
19972,Leonard,right.
19973,Leonard,"it wasn’t even very good. she was a smoker, i’d just been seasick."
19974,Leonard,"so, we’re still getting married?"
19975,Leonard,because we love each other.
19979,Leonard,"if you’re not into this, we can do it another time."
19983,Leonard,what happened now?
19986,Leonard,no.
19995,Leonard,you sure?
19997,Leonard,you’re right. i’m sorry. we have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. so what do you think? should we run next door and grab a bite?
20007,Leonard,it’s okay. i don’t have to say them.
20026,Leonard,"okay, listen, i may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
20029,Leonard,i wouldn’t.
20032,Leonard,can’t believe i’m spending my wedding night with you.
20035,Leonard,of course not.
20040,Leonard,what is happening?
20041,Leonard,"well, trust me, i wish it never happened."
20044,Leonard,call you back. hey.
20049,Leonard,what? why?
20054,Leonard,"fine, you want to meet her?"
20056,Leonard,you guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
20060,Leonard,"i’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
20076,Leonard,"okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
20077,Leonard,"i’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. but the good news is that i’m pretty sure i know why."
20079,Leonard,you do?
20096,Leonard,your house?
20103,Leonard,"yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
20107,Leonard,there’s gotta be something else we could try.
20112,Leonard,we got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
20115,Leonard,i still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. you’re a young man.
20132,Leonard,will you knock it off? we’re across the hall.
20134,Leonard,"wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
20135,Leonard,fine.
20143,Leonard,no gym shorts that can be yanked down.
20154,Leonard,"oh, buddy, i get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you."
20161,Leonard,"if you’re cranky and retaining water, i have a theory."
20162,Leonard,maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
20164,Leonard,you’re just sweaty from exercise.
20165,Leonard,i know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
20168,Leonard,what’s going on?
20175,Leonard,"hey, barry, we’re in trouble. we need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
20181,Leonard,how does he get the helium?
20182,Leonard,"oh, hey. i just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
20185,Leonard,he handed you the box directly and called you stretch.
20189,Leonard,"sure. so, are we doing this?"
20200,Leonard,my friend does make a decent point about the money. i don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
20201,Leonard,i don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a mexican standoff. what are we gonna do here?
20205,Leonard,"okay, but now there’s this swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. we really need this helium."
20206,Leonard,here’s the money. can we do this?
20208,Leonard,will you stop with that already?
20209,Leonard,and tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
20212,Leonard,"the dealer doesn’t care, kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. help me hook this up."
12023,Leonard,significant improvement over the old neighbour.
12025,Leonard,hi.
12026,Leonard,"we don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
20223,Leonard,he wants more money.
12035,Leonard,we already watched the season two dvds.
20229,Leonard,it says right here on wikipedia. a mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
20233,Leonard,i’m the one who thought of spockumentary.
12046,Leonard,"okay, well, make yourself at home."
20238,Leonard,when did we get a floor safe?
12048,Leonard,"i have a board. if you like boards, this is my board."
20241,Leonard,will wil want it?
12050,Leonard,at least i didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
12052,Leonard,here we go.
20254,Leonard,thank you.
20256,Leonard,"ah, well, what’s this? a pot of oatmeal? or, thanks to you, what i will now call gloatmeal."
12065,Leonard,so it’s based on your life?
12068,Leonard,don’t.
20260,Leonard,"ah, i also made oatmeal."
12071,Leonard,our shower works.
12075,Leonard,how so?
12079,Leonard,well i’m not trying to have sex with her.
20271,Leonard,"okay, we saw them. can we go catch the movie?"
12081,Leonard,"i’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, i’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
20277,Leonard,"well, we’re having everyone over."
12087,Leonard,it’s just not a good time.
12089,Leonard,uh-huh.
20281,Leonard,"really? how many grown-ups do you know who have mr. spock oven mitts? hey, the recipes are on my ipad. will you pull ’em up?"
20291,Leonard,baby.
12100,Leonard,"she asked me to do her a favour, sheldon."
12102,Leonard,that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
12117,Leonard,i’m sorry.
12122,Leonard,we’re home.
20315,Leonard,"well, hum it again. is that the spongebob song?"
12126,Leonard,our babies will be smart and beautiful.
12129,Leonard,"uh, i’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up."
12130,Leonard,here we go.
20330,Leonard,"that’s a trick question, right?"
12141,Leonard,"unless, superman matches her speed and decelerates. "
20336,Leonard,aw.
12149,Leonard,"what? oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
12154,Leonard,so penny’s a little messy.
12159,Leonard,"sheldon, this is not your home."
12162,Leonard,"oh, hey penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
20354,Leonard,"um, hey, wil. what you doin’?"
12164,Leonard,no.
12168,Leonard,sheldon?
20362,Leonard,"well, did you try wearing the shirt i said was inappropriate for work?"
12172,Leonard,"do you realise that if penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
20364,Leonard,none of that is true.
12174,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to get out of here."
12176,Leonard,that’s ridiculous. 
12179,Leonard,morning. 
20375,Leonard,"right? to this day, i send her a card every year with a little money in it."
12185,Leonard,penny’s up.
12186,Leonard,how did she know it was us?
20378,Leonard,"okay, now, what i’m hearing is that you feel that i sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish i’d be more succinct."
20381,Leonard,"oh, i actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
20385,Leonard,"well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
20386,Leonard,you know what’d be nice? name it after your girlfriends. show them how much you care.
12199,Leonard,yeah.
12201,Leonard,"one package, phillips head screws."
20395,Leonard,i wish that all the time. usually before i blow out birthday candles.
20399,Leonard,no.
12211,Leonard,"don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
20403,Leonard,"well, vegas, but…"
12215,Leonard,"raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
20410,Leonard,thank you. i appreciate that.
12219,Leonard,"you betrayed us for money, who are you?"
20412,Leonard,you’re still not coming.
12227,Leonard,"no, i’m fine. penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
20420,Leonard,what are you doing?
12230,Leonard,yeah. he was kinda dreamy.
20425,Leonard,fun. like your comic-con spock ears and your around the house spock ears.
20430,Leonard,still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
20432,Leonard,can you please live with us forever?
20434,Leonard,maybe we should give them some privacy.
20438,Leonard,"he never disappoints, does he?"
20443,Leonard,not really.
20446,Leonard,"well, you were right, tears."
20451,Leonard,a lot of attitude from the woman who thought mc squared was a rapper.
12263,Leonard,great. did we say a time?
12264,Leonard,and that’s still good for you.
20457,Leonard,see if you can get a table by the window.
20458,Leonard,what? why?
12267,Leonard,"to… carve the… okay, i’ll see you six thirty."
20463,Leonard,"mm, you watched the bachelor a lot."
20465,Leonard,"ha, ha. you married an old man. tell you what. let’s do something fun tonight."
12275,Leonard,you could have stopped at “it could go well.”
12277,Leonard,i’m having a panic attack.
20469,Leonard,are you actually gonna dance?
12284,Leonard,i don’t know. tell her i’m sick.
12291,Leonard,we both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
20483,Leonard,"relax, there’s room for two babies in this group."
20486,Leonard,"buddy, i, i think you might be overreacting."
12300,Leonard,"well, chafing, right?"
20494,Leonard,how is that a new invention?
12305,Leonard,i’m not okay.
12307,Leonard,"yes, but i get car sick too, so…"
12310,Leonard,yeah.
20508,Leonard,oh. that was really an asthma attack. i just sold it.
20512,Leonard,"well, where’s that information been this whole time?"
20516,Leonard,"well, just don’t get anything jurassic. he feels like that whole chunk of time has gone hollywood. hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking batman was coming to his party."
12326,Leonard,"well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
12327,Leonard,morning
20519,Leonard,can i get his contact info?
20520,Leonard,he is?
20524,Leonard,"i’m sold, you’re ahead of bale."
20532,Leonard,"again, no offence, but so have i."
12341,Leonard,thank you for coming on such short notice.
20534,Leonard,hey.
20535,Leonard,leslie. i can’t remember the last time we talked. so much has changed.
12356,Leonard,"hey, how did it go?"
20549,Leonard,"sorry, but we can’t sign this."
20550,Leonard,thank you for your time.
12361,Leonard,"just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
20559,Leonard,what?
20561,Leonard,they’ve been out there a while.
12372,Leonard,thank you sheldon.
12373,Leonard,"what did penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
12374,Leonard,"if penny didn’t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, penny, thought that i should her, lesley, out, indicating that she, penny, had no interest in me asking her, penny, out. but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she, lesley, had turned me down then she, penny, could be offering consolation. that’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. but while thinking, good, leonard remains available. "
12379,Leonard,"uh, sure, why not. "
20573,Leonard,"you know what, this part isn’t that technical. you actually could."
20576,Leonard,"yeah, perfect."
12385,Leonard,penny? what about her?
12389,Leonard,"yeah, yeah it is good. did you want to start now?"
12392,Leonard,are you sure?
20588,Leonard,i mean without lying.
20589,Leonard,come on. we’re a couple of smart guys. i’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
20590,Leonard,they bought it.
20593,Leonard,who are you texting?
12402,Leonard,she fixed your equation.
20594,Leonard,he’ll never make it in time.
20596,Leonard,hey.
12405,Leonard,yeah. 
12407,Leonard,brrrr. why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
12409,Leonard,just extending the intimacy. do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
20601,Leonard,"buddy, i am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
20602,Leonard,because he’s hitting on you?
12412,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’m just glad to be a part of it. so what happens now?"
12417,Leonard,"well, how did you know about it?"
20610,Leonard,i know. did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like colonial williamsburg.
12422,Leonard,"oh, to be honest, i don’t think it’s going to work out. "
12428,Leonard,"sheldon, let it go."
20628,Leonard,that’s right.
20633,Leonard,six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
20634,Leonard,"no, i do, and that’s why i hid it."
12444,Leonard,"terrific. um, this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group, and i need you not to embarrass me tonight. "
12445,Leonard,"for example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is leakey. "
20637,Leonard,really? why?
12447,Leonard,"hey, sorry we’re late. "
20641,Leonard,"oh, yes."
20643,Leonard,i love you.
12453,Leonard,where do you get this stuff?
20646,Leonard,but what if man-man dressed as a bat?
20648,Leonard,i thought you were back with emily.
12457,Leonard,then what happens?
20649,Leonard,you mean like through their window from behind a bush?
20653,Leonard,your attendance implies it’s not.
12462,Leonard,hi.
12463,Leonard,why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
20657,Leonard,you’re the only one who eats them.
12470,Leonard,then he and i are on equal ground.
20666,Leonard,not funny.
12475,Leonard,"no, i’m a hobbit."
12477,Leonard,i think we’re all talking to penny here.
12479,Leonard,"no, i said animalistic. of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. "
12481,Leonard,a homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
12483,Leonard,"there’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
12486,Leonard,no.
20680,Leonard,"i don’t know how you put up with it. he’s impossible. i mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
20688,Leonard,she defends him all the time.
12499,Leonard,"because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. "
12503,Leonard,so? we’ll start now.
12505,Leonard,"so, if you don’t like this christie, why are you letting her stay? "
12507,Leonard,"okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back. "
12508,Leonard,well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half.
12509,Leonard,great idea.
20699,Leonard,let’s get out of here.
20704,Leonard,how come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
20705,Leonard,i’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
20709,Leonard,"okay, help me out. how are you doing this? do they know about each other?"
20715,Leonard,"oh, i found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. it teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
20718,Leonard,"okay, have fun."
12531,Leonard,"well, sleep tight."
12532,Leonard,"funny expression, sleep tight. it refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight. "
20725,Leonard,thanks.
20729,Leonard,way better.
20730,Leonard,"i have to admit, i’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
20732,Leonard,would you like a glass of wine?
12542,Leonard,"howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
20735,Leonard,what good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about armageddon?
12544,Leonard,i see a problem. 
20736,Leonard,how?
20737,Leonard,very funny.
12550,Leonard,"wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth."
12556,Leonard,"sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
12561,Leonard,who are you calling?
12562,Leonard,"sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo."
12563,Leonard,"you’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. "
20757,Leonard,when’s the screening?
12567,Leonard,"there’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher. "
20763,Leonard,you think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
12573,Leonard,hi.
20766,Leonard,he’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
12583,Leonard,so call her. 
20775,Leonard,you did everything you could.
20778,Leonard,"oh, sheldon invoked rosa parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
20780,Leonard,wow. well done.
20781,Leonard,"did she think you were choking or… i’m sorry, that’s great. thank you for spending time with her."
12591,Leonard,whatever you recommend.
20786,Leonard,is your brother out of prison?
12599,Leonard,beats the hell out of me. 
20795,Leonard,penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
12609,Leonard,"okay, the x10s are online."
20803,Leonard,mom.
12612,Leonard,"no, hang on, hang on.  see! "
12613,Leonard,"wireless webcams, wave hello. "
20807,Leonard,what is his hurry?
20809,Leonard,"oh, we were following howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
12619,Leonard,are there any other honours i’ve gotten that i don’t know about? did ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it?
12620,Leonard,"shut up, howard. sheldon, we have to do this."
20812,Leonard,"penny, i’ve always known i loved you, but this last year has shown me that i also love being married to you. thank you for saying yes."
12623,Leonard,"excuse me, i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. "
20815,Leonard,what is happening there?
12625,Leonard,"alright, i don’t care what you say, i’m going to the conference and i’m presenting our findings. "
20821,Leonard,no.
20826,Leonard,"here you are, mother."
20828,Leonard,"yeah, special, like that.  that’s them. please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
20829,Leonard,"hey, guys, come on in."
12639,Leonard,"i know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
20832,Leonard,"mary, i’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
12643,Leonard,"because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit. "
12644,Leonard,"uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. "
20837,Leonard,hello.
12646,Leonard,yeah. everything since the eighth grade. 
20839,Leonard,"and he can’t wait to meet you, too. can i get anyone a drink?"
12648,Leonard,great.
12649,Leonard,what… . 
12651,Leonard,sheldon i didn’t mean it like that.
12652,Leonard,"i don’t know, i wasn’t choosing my…"
12656,Leonard,"you’re right, this side does look better. "
12657,Leonard,you’re kidding. 
12658,Leonard,"all? in particle physics, twenty five is woodstock. "
20851,Leonard,are you crazy? you can’t put that on snapchat.
12660,Leonard,"a joke. okay. how about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. so, he calls a physicist to help. the physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, i have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  right? "
12661,Leonard,"it’s a classic, right? "
20852,Leonard,that’s not a bad idea.
20855,Leonard,hi. 
20857,Leonard,"someday, when i’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
12667,Leonard,"look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
20859,Leonard,yes.
20860,Leonard,i’m getting enraged.
20862,Leonard,hi.
20868,Leonard,"oh, thanks, man. "
12678,Leonard,excuse me. is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
20872,Leonard,i’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
20875,Leonard,"oh, my turn, my turn."
20876,Leonard,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
20877,Leonard,"sure, i’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
20879,Leonard,"guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. now, can you please try"
12688,Leonard,no you don’t. no he doesn’t.
12689,Leonard,"oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
20880,Leonard,"it’s been three and a half minutes, wake up."
20881,Leonard,"oh, i had a good dream that when i carried you to bed, i let your head hit the wall and i laughed."
12693,Leonard,see you.  
12694,Leonard,"yes, i did. "
20888,Leonard,are you okay?
12701,Leonard,"sheldon, what is it? "
20897,Leonard,"uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
12707,Leonard,"it’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. "
12708,Leonard,well now you are.
20902,Leonard,"sheldon. we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you. so have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, i don’t care."
20906,Leonard,"it’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
20908,Leonard,"um, i don’t really know how to say this."
20909,Leonard,"right. sorry, sir."
20911,Leonard,"i understand that we’re under contract, and i don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
12720,Leonard,"okay, why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
20912,Leonard,"thanks for understanding, sir."
12726,Leonard,"so she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach? "
20923,Leonard,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this. 
12733,Leonard,well… i don’t know what to say. 
20925,Leonard,keep m&m’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
12738,Leonard,"wait, are we really going to long beach? "
20931,Leonard,"that’s it. it’s sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
20934,Leonard,"hey, sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
20936,Leonard,i’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
12746,Leonard,"oh, god! sheldon does not have a cousin leo."
12748,Leonard,"yeah, i got it, sheldon, why?"
12754,Leonard,"gee, why wouldn’t i?"
20946,Leonard,don’t.
20949,Leonard,"when you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. you just have to keep communicating."
20952,Leonard,"no, that’s actually what we did with him when howard came back from space."
20954,Leonard,"i prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but i still need to get all my pants hemmed."
20955,Leonard,don’t beat yourself up. you’ve never lived with anyone before.
12764,Leonard,"penny, you’ll have to excuse sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe. "
12767,Leonard,what the hell are you doing?
12768,Leonard,with lime jello?
12771,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting? "
12772,Leonard,i’m going back to bed. 
12776,Leonard,huh. i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology. 
12777,Leonard,yes.
12778,Leonard,yes.
12782,Leonard,"alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. "
20977,Leonard,"you’ll have nerds fawning all over you. if you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
20983,Leonard,never been on this side of the table before. i feel powerful.
20984,Leonard,"okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. "
20988,Leonard,that’ll be four seventy-five.
12799,Leonard,oh great.
20993,Leonard,no. she cannot kiss. what is wrong with you people?
12802,Leonard,i’m thinking! 
20994,Leonard,"no, no, no. it’s not okay."
20996,Leonard,i am.
12808,Leonard,won’t my footsteps set it off? 
21005,Leonard,"it’s cute, they’re having fun living together."
12815,Leonard,"okay, it’s on."
12819,Leonard,no! 
21014,Leonard,yes.
12826,Leonard,how about that. 
21018,Leonard,"uh, no. "
21030,Leonard,"mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
21032,Leonard,you really didn’t think i’d notice my stuff was missing?
21034,Leonard,and?
21037,Leonard,but you won’t be living here.
21038,Leonard,you guys might want to start eating. but you won’t be living here.
21039,Leonard,"look, i get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours."
12850,Leonard,yes.
12858,Leonard,"hang on, are we talking about murdering dennis kim? i’m not saying no. "
12870,Leonard,i think that’s our girl. one of us should go talk to her. 
21064,Leonard,how much money did he win?
12882,Leonard,"you’re kidding, why not?"
21074,Leonard,"hey, i’m trying to help you."
12886,Leonard,the needs of the many.
21083,Leonard,"although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so i can get it on video."
21085,Leonard,"if it helps, i’m questioning your life choices, too."
21086,Leonard,does it spin around and do tricks?
21090,Leonard,"excuse me, i have to go take some pictures."
12904,Leonard,"well, you’re a friend, and you like batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team. "
21096,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
21104,Leonard,so you think you should keep it?
21107,Leonard,"you know what, sheldon, take it. in fact, you can have everything, i really don’t care."
12918,Leonard,yes. 
21112,Leonard,"yeah, i like this one."
12924,Leonard,she’s in. 
21118,Leonard,"you’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
21119,Leonard,"sheldon, i know what you did, now change the password back."
21120,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m warning you, i can play this game, too."
12930,Leonard,the eta meson.
21127,Leonard,"unbelievable. okay, uh, i don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
12936,Leonard,"um, eight.  point four. "
21130,Leonard,"uh, theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
12939,Leonard,"sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
21133,Leonard,we lived together 13 years. how can you be so awful to me?
21134,Leonard,because you were being selfish.
21139,Leonard,"well, i’d like that, too. "
21140,Leonard,you promise?
12951,Leonard,uh-huh.
12952,Leonard,yeah. and that’s my bid.
12954,Leonard,not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
12964,Leonard,how are we going to get it upstairs? 
12965,Leonard,yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years. 
12969,Leonard,"uh, just give us a few minutes."
12975,Leonard,"sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. now out of the way so i can sit in my time machine.  okay, i am setting the dials for march 10th, 1876. "
21167,Leonard,absolutely not.
12986,Leonard,but it would make the present so much nicer. 
21179,Leonard,"look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
21180,Leonard,thank you.
21182,Leonard,do not need a break.
21183,Leonard,"if i need a break, i’ll ask for a break."
12996,Leonard,no problem. 
21192,Leonard,and this wine is why.
13005,Leonard,i paid two hundred dollars for my share.
21198,Leonard,why?
13008,Leonard,"it’s not a bidding war, i’m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store. "
13010,Leonard,"forget it guys, if i sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
21202,Leonard,"so, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night."
13012,Leonard,"sheldon, get out of my way."
21206,Leonard,just ignore him.
13015,Leonard,"still, i think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life. "
21207,Leonard,what’s that supposed to mean?
13019,Leonard,"it is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
13025,Leonard,howard…
13026,Leonard,"oh, hey buddy. "
13027,Leonard,"sheldon, are you going to introduce us? "
13029,Leonard,"so, how do you two know each other."
21225,Leonard,"i don’t want to play a game, sheldon."
13036,Leonard,those are not mine.
21237,Leonard,what do you say?
21238,Leonard,does it really need to say that?
21240,Leonard,"me, too."
13053,Leonard,"that’s great, but i…."
21252,Leonard,"hey, great news. the tv i want will fit in the gaming room, and if i leave the curtains open, i can watch it from work."
21258,Leonard,remember that when the new tv falls off the wall and crushes us both.
21259,Leonard,"yeah, sure. he really worked with the drug enforcement agency?"
13069,Leonard,"hi penny, how’s it going. listen, that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
13074,Leonard,"oh, it’s called trestling."
13080,Leonard,"no. but it was okay. i mean, when i was little i’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson, and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when i got to the door i could hear people whispering, and i could smell german chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
21273,Leonard,we owe you an apology.
13082,Leonard,"oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. i got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
13083,Leonard,"howard, every thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. they see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
13084,Leonard,hey. 
21275,Leonard,"and, sorry about the suitcase."
13087,Leonard,oh. pass. 
21282,Leonard,"good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
21283,Leonard,"that’s great, but the air force approved the specs. we’re good to go."
13092,Leonard,what’s the matter?
13093,Leonard,"oh my god, why did you eat it?"
21288,Leonard,you’re kidding.
21290,Leonard,"you can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
13102,Leonard,"say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. "
21294,Leonard,this train thing worked out better than i thought. he’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
13104,Leonard,"there is a party, isn’t there."
13105,Leonard,howard. 
13106,Leonard,how could i be mad? you actually risked your life because you cared about me.
21300,Leonard,"sir, uh, if i may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. it’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
21304,Leonard,"come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. why are you doing this?"
13119,Leonard,"i’m not going to do that, howard."
13123,Leonard,i said i’m her friend. not her gay friend. 
13125,Leonard,no. no. 
21318,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
13127,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what were the choices again? "
13129,Leonard,actually it’s not all that easy to find. 
21322,Leonard,how ya doing?
21324,Leonard,"yes, he is."
21325,Leonard,"aw, that used to work with sheldon."
21326,Leonard,who forgot to crack the window?
21327,Leonard,hey.
21329,Leonard,but all you did was complain when he did that.
13138,Leonard,"what is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal. "
21330,Leonard,"i’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
13141,Leonard,"oh, sure. huh, maybe i am her gay friend. "
21337,Leonard,yeah.
13146,Leonard,what happened?
13149,Leonard,"oh, penny, i am so sorry."
21341,Leonard,we’re helping raj figure out his finances.
13152,Leonard,what about me?
13153,Leonard,what about if you went out with me?
21344,Leonard,"we don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
21345,Leonard,"no. which will make me miserable, which is usually sheldon’s job."
21348,Leonard,that i would do to her.
21352,Leonard,"i know. sometimes howard wears a striped shirt so we can play where’s wolowitz? okay, now, this is us camping out in line for the avengers panel."
13161,Leonard,i don’t think i can go out with her tonight. 
21356,Leonard,"i even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
21358,Leonard,"yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
13167,Leonard,you’re not helping. 
21360,Leonard,"oh, why? do you not want to go?"
13170,Leonard,hi. 
21366,Leonard,"sure, or you can."
13187,Leonard,"bite me. sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
13193,Leonard,i didn’t say anything like that.
13194,Leonard,"look, everything went fine. i didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. the woman across the hall is into me. "
13195,Leonard,that’s not a bad sign.
21386,Leonard,"you know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
21396,Leonard,perfect timing. food’s ready.
13205,Leonard,what? 
13209,Leonard,i’m still confused.
13210,Leonard,"it’s not you, howard, he says he’s moving out. "
13211,Leonard,no.
13214,Leonard,"i didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
13221,Leonard,why not.
13224,Leonard,"not that secret, the other secret."
21422,Leonard,i’d still like to know who jerry is.
21423,Leonard,that would be great. thank you.
13236,Leonard,"please let it go, sheldon."
13241,Leonard,"can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
21439,Leonard,thank you. i…
13250,Leonard,what happened to you?
13251,Leonard,"yes i have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
21444,Leonard,"yeah, why?"
13253,Leonard,"look, i like leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
13254,Leonard,how?
21446,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
21451,Leonard,seven.
21453,Leonard,"i don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
13266,Leonard,i kind of have other plans tonight.
21462,Leonard,that’s just great.
21463,Leonard,i honestly don’t remember.
13286,Leonard,"okay, well, goodnight. "
13287,Leonard,right 
21481,Leonard,"if you’re that upset, go get her back."
21486,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
21488,Leonard,"doing it right now. oh, they can’t. there’s an important little league game tomorrow."
21490,Leonard,hot dogs.
13299,Leonard,what’s the bright side?
13300,Leonard,oh yeah.
21491,Leonard,you’re gonna have to be more specific.
21493,Leonard,"oh, the video game. yeah, that was bad."
21497,Leonard,"honestly? it’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
13312,Leonard,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
13321,Leonard,penny’s been keeping him up at night.
13323,Leonard,"sheldon, wake up."
21515,Leonard,so you think it’s okay?
13327,Leonard,sheldon…
13329,Leonard,hi tom. sheldon? didn’t i explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
13331,Leonard,you got penny to sign up for online dating?
21523,Leonard,absolutely. i just want you to be happy. and maybe a little turned on about how selfless i’m being.
21525,Leonard,thank you.
13334,Leonard,they never do.
13336,Leonard,who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
13344,Leonard,"okay, let’s try it this way, what if the people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve?"
21536,Leonard,"you won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
21538,Leonard,"oh, no. when?"
13347,Leonard,"and when we go in there, let’s show raj that we’re happy for him."
21539,Leonard,"so, are you excited to have your own place again?"
21540,Leonard,"ah, we’ll miss you, too."
21546,Leonard,"all right, let me start again. uh, you and amy…"
21549,Leonard,"well, the last three nights i’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a walgreens in arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. now ask me how i’m doing with amy gone."
13358,Leonard,you just got him this afternoon.
13361,Leonard,"well, uh, no i… the… no."
13364,Leonard,you look very nice.
21564,Leonard,"no offence, stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
21565,Leonard,you kept walking. i think you did.
21567,Leonard,and you actually got in a pool?
13376,Leonard,yes.
13378,Leonard,you’re welcome.
13381,Leonard,sorry.
13383,Leonard,do the shrimpers feature in your story?
13388,Leonard,"that may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
13392,Leonard,i’m not going to work.
13397,Leonard,"goodnight, sheldon."
13398,Leonard,take the bus.
21591,Leonard,hey.
21598,Leonard,"um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate. "
13407,Leonard,"so we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
13409,Leonard,"penny’s taking you to the dmv, i’m going to bed."
13410,Leonard,"because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
21606,Leonard,what does that mean?
21617,Leonard,"oh, hi, steph, come on in."
13426,Leonard,"i wonder a lot of things about you, sheldon, but not… not that."
13429,Leonard,it’s never safe.
13433,Leonard,"no, he lives here now."
13436,Leonard,"so, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. once again, i’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach snapple into a helium neon laser. short answer is… don’t. and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is dr. sheldon cooper. dr. cooper?"
13437,Leonard,"excuse me. sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
13443,Leonard,sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
21635,Leonard,"what! what, what, what?"
21636,Leonard,"gesundheit. or as they say in switzerland, gesundheit. you getting a cold?"
21638,Leonard,hey.
21641,Leonard,"it’s just two degrees, sheldon. i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
21642,Leonard,"yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
13451,Leonard,"honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
21643,Leonard,"aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
21647,Leonard,"you’re insane, you know that?!"
21654,Leonard,"yeah, hi. listen, i just got a text from raj. he wanted me to tell you that when howard says nap, he means sex."
13465,Leonard,"yeah, i can see that. sheldon, halo night, koothrappali’s. you coming?"
21657,Leonard,"uh-oh, that’s priya."
21664,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
13473,Leonard,"don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t  aw! what’s going on?"
21665,Leonard,too casual?
13476,Leonard,that only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the earth.
21668,Leonard,"you call that a glow stick? that is a glow stick. come on, let’s go."
13479,Leonard,not unless she destroys tokyo.
21672,Leonard,‘sup?
13484,Leonard,potl.
21676,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sweating my bald cap off."
13486,Leonard,really? define it.
21678,Leonard,"disneyland. go on, i’m listening."
21679,Leonard,"excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. north sea, how can i kelp you?"
13490,Leonard,"yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current mrs. wolowitz."
13491,Leonard,did i miss anything? did they kick giselle off?
13493,Leonard,what are you doing?
21685,Leonard,little ball of fur.
21686,Leonard,you’re right. this is even weirder than i thought.
21693,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
13505,Leonard,put it on the agenda.
21697,Leonard,yeah.
13521,Leonard,we’re not encouraging. it’s more like knuckling under.
13523,Leonard,you can recognize people on google earth?
13529,Leonard,"there, see? problem solved."
21724,Leonard,what?
13534,Leonard,"all right, i really didn’t want to do this, but… here."
21740,Leonard,"uh, i’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
13549,Leonard,what?
13550,Leonard,how can 5 not be worse than 1?
21745,Leonard,fine. i’ll take it.
13555,Leonard,no one’s a scientist like howard.
13561,Leonard,psst! psst!
21755,Leonard,what do you want? i didn’t say come in!
13566,Leonard,"yeah, i really didn’t think this through."
13567,Leonard,what?
21760,Leonard,"oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. howard and raj helped me bring it up."
21762,Leonard,"according to the roommate agreement, i’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
13572,Leonard,i’m going to the office.
21764,Leonard,what am i doing in your spam folder?
21767,Leonard,i like it.
21768,Leonard,there you go– three against one.
21769,Leonard,but i said no to that.
21771,Leonard,that your dad?
21773,Leonard,"oh, this just might be your lucky day."
13582,Leonard,don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
21776,Leonard,there’s no mistake.
21777,Leonard,"well, i’ve adjusted the formula."
21780,Leonard,oh. right.
13589,Leonard,"exactly. thank you. do me a favour, tell koothrappali that next time you see him."
21781,Leonard,what’d you do that for? i had plenty of time. 
13596,Leonard,so why’d you ask?
13597,Leonard,"listen, i need to talk to you about something."
13599,Leonard,"hi, howard. howard?"
13607,Leonard,i stand corrected.
13608,Leonard,she doesn’t mean it. she’s just being nice.
13610,Leonard,do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
13616,Leonard,"oh, clearly i could have."
13625,Leonard,"okay, i’m going to make this very simple for you. you are not in this relationship, i am. ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie."
13626,Leonard,"general order 104, section a does not apply in this situation."
13634,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sakes."
13638,Leonard,"oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. "
13641,Leonard,she stuck a needle into my hand!
13652,Leonard,don’t even! i don’t want to hear another word out of you.
13658,Leonard,do you understand that stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
13660,Leonard,"no, you’re not."
13661,Leonard,thank you.
13663,Leonard,that’s absurd.
13665,Leonard,i’m going to bed.
13666,Leonard,"no, absolutely not."
13669,Leonard,"she’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… i never slept with her, i swear!"
13674,Leonard,why do i feel like i’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
13677,Leonard,how could i not be sure?
13684,Leonard,"yeah, stephanie got them for me."
13692,Leonard,are you sure?
13694,Leonard,"no, everything’s fine."
13695,Leonard,"yeah. it’s wonderful. okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
13704,Leonard,"listen, we need to talk."
13712,Leonard,"i just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
13715,Leonard,thank you.
13718,Leonard,"not specifically, but, uh, i did tell her that i had feelings."
13722,Leonard,really?
13726,Leonard,"i really like you, but i want to see how things go with mark?"
13727,Leonard,"oh, right, yeah, um, so, stephanie, here’s the thing. i really like you."
13729,Leonard,"no! no, no! i wasn’t going to say any of that. i was just going to say, i really like you."
13737,Leonard,"raj, please, let’s stay serious here. superman’s body is kryptonian, therefore his sweat is kryptonian."
13738,Leonard,it’s david underhill. so what?
13739,Leonard,"i have two words for you. the first is big, the other’s whoop."
13758,Leonard,"oh, yeah. it’s just a little motorcycle accident."
13763,Leonard,since when?
13766,Leonard,"yeah, if you like that type."
13767,Leonard,"no, just neighbours."
13771,Leonard,"oh, hey, dave. and penny, what a surprise."
13776,Leonard,yippee.
13779,Leonard,my leg is killing me. thanks for asking.
13791,Leonard,"very good, thanks for asking. come on in."
13793,Leonard,"oh, then, i think you’ll appreciate what i got you."
13797,Leonard,how about the toaster oven?
13800,Leonard,uh-huh?
13802,Leonard,"howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
13807,Leonard,"i don’t know, now they’re just yelling about popsicles. sounds like penny really got to him."
13812,Leonard,i need you to apologize to how…
13816,Leonard,he’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? the guy is devastated.
13824,Leonard,she’s a delightful woman. you’ll love her.
13825,Leonard,"oh, my god. that’s kripke’s robot?"
13826,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to call it off."
13832,Leonard,"neat. good work. sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
13837,Leonard,forget the robot. what happened to you?
13843,Leonard,good luck getting time on it. the only people he lets use it are his friends.
13863,Leonard,where are we going?
13868,Leonard,"don’t look up, there’s cameras."
13872,Leonard,i’m sorry. can we please just do it one more time?
13874,Leonard,how was rock climbing?
13878,Leonard,can i whistle?
13881,Leonard,hmmm.
13885,Leonard,"sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency?"
13888,Leonard,do i have to?
13891,Leonard,stop it!
13894,Leonard,did you guys have an argument?
13895,Leonard,"well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
13900,Leonard,"fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. "
13901,Leonard,"it was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
13904,Leonard,"but if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in green lantern’s ass."
13909,Leonard,"back in the pocket it goes. look, you do understand that sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. it’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
13916,Leonard,"nothing? it sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
13917,Leonard,your ex-boyfriend?
13918,Leonard,what?
13922,Leonard,well what are you gonna do?
13923,Leonard,"oh, no. oh, you don’t want to do that."
13926,Leonard,really?
13929,Leonard,– come on. it’ll be fun.
13936,Leonard,"excuse me. when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor, didn’t samwise, pippin and merry go with him?"
13950,Leonard,no. you can leave if you want to. i’m gonna see this through.
13951,Leonard,"i guess, technically, that was my fault.  i’m not leaving here without penny’s money."
13956,Leonard,"hey, i know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
13970,Leonard,yes.
13971,Leonard,yes.
13975,Leonard,i’ll start again.
13981,Leonard,"oh, my god. what happened?"
13986,Leonard,"boy, you suck."
13997,Leonard,yep.
13999,Leonard,nothing. mother likes looking at brains and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
14005,Leonard,"hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. you know what i used to do when i was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
14007,Leonard,"yeah. i got a dressmaker’s mannequin, i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
14009,Leonard,my father used to borrow it.
14018,Leonard,she said shush. i should have shushed. 
14021,Leonard,you don’t have to. ever.
14032,Leonard,"what about it, howard?"
14050,Leonard,sheldon! how was the comic book store?
14055,Leonard,what do you mean?
14056,Leonard,"i don’t know what you’re talking about. oh, that. penny did that."
14059,Leonard,"if it were your head, it would be."
14063,Leonard,that’s not fair. you’re not even a physicist.
14065,Leonard,why are you crouching there?
14069,Leonard,"penny, penny, i think i know what to do. sheldon, i have some bad news."
14075,Leonard,"oh, god, i wish i had."
14076,Leonard,"yeah, buddy?"
14079,Leonard,"okay. now, we all run out. sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees. raj, howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. then we’ll all have a great view as penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
14081,Leonard,"sheldon, penny was our only hope."
14088,Leonard,you’ve heard of him?
14090,Leonard,"well, we had a vote. three of us voted for airplane, sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
14092,Leonard,what are you doing?
14095,Leonard,i wouldn’t expect you to. i’ll see you later.
14099,Leonard,"oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
14105,Leonard,"excuse me, but what about me? why don’t i get a shot?"
14127,Leonard,look at it. non-alcoholic beer.
14134,Leonard,"excuse me.  okay, i’ll be honest with you. i’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. but then i finally realized you’re a human being; i’m a human being. i could just say to you…"
14135,Leonard,"hi, my name’s leonard."
14137,Leonard,damn it. i slipped.
14142,Leonard,let’s go. we’re going to miss the coming attractions.
14147,Leonard,she’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
14153,Leonard,"okay, what’s wrong with it?"
14161,Leonard,"the fifth annual east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance luau."
14164,Leonard,what are you doing?
14174,Leonard,"sorry. my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford, new jersey."
14187,Leonard,hello.
14191,Leonard,sheldon…
14196,Leonard,i think you look fantastic.
14212,Leonard,problem?
14213,Leonard,"yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday of every month would be anything can happen thursday."
14224,Leonard,"come on, i’ll help you pick something."
14236,Leonard,when did you pick up on that?
14237,Leonard,"sure, why not?"
14243,Leonard,"hey, howard?"
14251,Leonard,i think blinky’s cute.
14257,Leonard,say what?
14273,Leonard,"i’ve never been there, have you?"
14277,Leonard,"great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
14283,Leonard,"okay, uh, if i get lucky i’ll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city, and if you get lucky, i’ll sleep on the moon."
14298,Leonard,"yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
14310,Leonard,nobody wants that.
14319,Leonard,yes.
14320,Leonard,about what?
14329,Leonard,"i’m not answering the phone, sheldon."
14334,Leonard,"well, what are you gonna do?"
14335,Leonard,"so, what do you need us for?"
14336,Leonard,good one.
14338,Leonard,um…
14342,Leonard,"all right, well, off the top of my head, i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow. i mean, glacial."
14349,Leonard,morning.
14363,Leonard,leonard?
14368,Leonard,"i’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
14375,Leonard,"yes, how did we live before twitter? i guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
14376,Leonard,"yeah, i know the feeling."
14378,Leonard,everybody?
14383,Leonard,"okay, well, do you want to go?"
14384,Leonard,"sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
14399,Leonard,"oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. sorry, i was gonna tell you."
14400,Leonard,"actually, it would help."
14410,Leonard,"sheldon, you know i can’t eat butter. i’m lactose intolerant."
14412,Leonard,"oh, a blanket."
14416,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s me."
14418,Leonard,i don’t think i can go to the north pole.
14420,Leonard,"terrific, it’s just that i don’t think penny wants me to go."
14421,Leonard,not exactly. but she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
14423,Leonard,"yes, obviously."
14429,Leonard,"all right, fine. what about that really long hug? what did that mean?"
14435,Leonard,we’re out of ice.
14441,Leonard,"uh, oh, sorry."
14443,Leonard,i’m going to go let penny know we’re back.
14447,Leonard,"damn his vulcan hearing. not a good time, sheldon."
14450,Leonard,"because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. there was even a plan. we were going to throw his kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
14452,Leonard,"aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. so write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
14454,Leonard,"what? uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
14461,Leonard,so much for our friendship with sheldon.
14462,Leonard,"hey. listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, i didn’t have a chance to give you this."
14478,Leonard,– we took the red-eye.
14483,Leonard,"and bring you home. so, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
14488,Leonard,"i mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. we’re whatever this is. but why label it, right? i mean, it is what it is and…"
14491,Leonard,"hey, guys."
14493,Leonard,"there’s more to life than sex, raj."
14494,Leonard,"nothing flamed out. we don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
14496,Leonard,"nothing like that happened, all right? the sex was just fine."
14507,Leonard,"penny, wait. aagh! what is wrong with you?"
14508,Leonard,please don’t be mad.
14513,Leonard,okay-dokay.
14514,Leonard,so much.
14519,Leonard,what?
14522,Leonard,"god, i had the most horrible night."
14528,Leonard,excuse me.
14529,Leonard,little bit. 
14532,Leonard,i guess.
14534,Leonard,"good, good."
14541,Leonard,"sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny."
14545,Leonard,"sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
14549,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
14558,Leonard,"well, you shouldn’t."
14562,Leonard,what could she possibly be talking about for so long?
14566,Leonard,"i’m not. and penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
14570,Leonard,"i was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
14571,Leonard,"really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
14575,Leonard,"we’re watching goonies, gremlins and young sherlock holmes. they were all written by chris columbus."
14592,Leonard,"little bit, yeah."
14596,Leonard,oh. okay. tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. just throw it away.
14598,Leonard,"yeah, okay. um, howard, we need to talk."
14609,Leonard,see? ruined.
14615,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
14616,Leonard,"howard, you can’t hold me to that."
14617,Leonard,"because when i made that agreement, i didn’t think i’d ever have a hot girlfriend. and i was positive you never would."
14621,Leonard,"because i’ve been busy, because i haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and i can’t stress how key this is, because i don’t want to."
14622,Leonard,"it’s not that simple. what am i supposed to say? penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
14629,Leonard,"yeah, i’m familiar with bert and ernie."
14630,Leonard,over puppets?
14639,Leonard,i had to ask. you didn’t have to say yes.
14643,Leonard,"kites, ho!"
14645,Leonard,we’re heading out for some kite fighting.
14652,Leonard,why wouldn’t penny want her friends to meet me?
14653,Leonard,"maybe koothrappali’s right, maybe i embarrass her."
14655,Leonard,"so, penny doesn’t want me around her friends, i embarrass her. what else could it be?"
14657,Leonard,hey.
14662,Leonard,"well, yeah, no, i met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. were they here today?"
14664,Leonard,i wouldn’t be bored. why would i be bored?
14666,Leonard,"okay, some of my facebook friends aren’t geniuses. my point is, if we’re going to be a couple, i should be friends with your friends."
14673,Leonard,"there’s no fooling you. now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
14675,Leonard,huh… scrimmage…
14676,Leonard,oh.
14682,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, please teach me about football. it’ll be fun."
14688,Leonard,what’s wrong with a football jersey?
14698,Leonard,"okay, yeah. i can see the difference."
14703,Leonard,"oh, i guess so."
14711,Leonard,"oh, gee, sheldon, i don’t think we can play on sunday."
14719,Leonard,"oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. yippee."
14720,Leonard,"okay, not to be pedantic, but the last i checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which i think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
14732,Leonard,and then i say one little thing and i end up being the bad guy!
14733,Leonard,"what am i supposed to say? sure, penny, i’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. well, leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because i’m penny and i’m pretty and i can do whatever the hell i want! oh, i get it! you think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! no, no, leonard! i’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
14738,Leonard,just give us a minute.
14746,Leonard,thank you!
14749,Leonard,sure.
14758,Leonard,"the brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
14762,Leonard,i’m not leaving until you talk to me.
14765,Leonard,why should i let it go? why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
14766,Leonard,always is a long time. sure. always.
14770,Leonard,"uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
14773,Leonard,"i wish penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
14781,Leonard,i hate my name. it has nerd in it. len nerd.
14787,Leonard,"oh, god, i am so hungry."
14790,Leonard,what kind of score are we looking at?
14791,Leonard,"all right, everyone grab flashlights."
14796,Leonard,"no, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
14802,Leonard,hey.
14803,Leonard,you’d have a better shot with the three-breasted martian hooker from total recall.
14805,Leonard,"again, i’m right here."
14808,Leonard,"come on, it wasn’t that bad."
14811,Leonard,"i fell on the floor. all right, he got you, you can get him back."
14822,Leonard,"i gotta say, i am really impressed. this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even. "
14824,Leonard,and the board of directors. abort! abort!
14825,Leonard,at least they don’t know it was you.
14832,Leonard,that’s where sheldon sits.
14848,Leonard,you do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
14851,Leonard,you told her my experiment was stupid?
14853,Leonard,"okay, good, ’cause i wasn’t really gonna go."
14855,Leonard,"or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
14870,Leonard,"um, tomorrow?"
14874,Leonard,"okay, sorry."
14889,Leonard,all right. he “has” a “girlfriend.”
14890,Leonard,"oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, i’ll get you a plate. mom, you remember penny."
14893,Leonard,when did this happen?
14895,Leonard,i don’t believe this. why am i the last to know?
14896,Leonard,"you’re right. i’m-i’m-i’m-i’m sorry, i’m way out of line!"
14900,Leonard,that’s a lousy conversation starter.
14906,Leonard,you’re my surrogate family?
14918,Leonard,"what are you trying to tell me, howard?"
14919,Leonard,don’t worry. we’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
14926,Leonard,"oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? they don’t let just anyone have a web site."
14928,Leonard,"come on, penny."
14929,Leonard,"i’m sorry, but facts are facts."
14931,Leonard,you’re welcome. how’s your fish?
14932,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
14935,Leonard,"you know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… "
14943,Leonard,"do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
14944,Leonard,"what’s your point? in order to keep having a sexual relationship with penny, i have to give up everything i believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who i am? i can’t do that, howard."
14946,Leonard,"hey. cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. i could never be mad at you."
14948,Leonard,would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
14951,Leonard,"no, not at all. let me help you with this stuff."
14952,Leonard,great.
14957,Leonard,you know what? let’s just get a pizza.
14959,Leonard,what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
14971,Leonard,"yes, we are. and we’re about to go to bed."
14974,Leonard,"it’s getting scary here, too."
14977,Leonard,great. good night.
14985,Leonard,"god, sheldon. what the hell are you doing out there?"
14994,Leonard,"oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. everybody’s really excited about it."
14996,Leonard,they call themselves bozites?
15017,Leonard,that was amazing how you handled him.
15019,Leonard,"me, too, but i paid three bucks for it."
15020,Leonard,"hello. yeah, i’m leonard hofstadter. yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. oh, god, is he okay? yeah, alright, alright, i’ll be right there."
15023,Leonard,thanks for not calling the cops.
15025,Leonard,"sure, sure. how did you get into this place?"
15030,Leonard,and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
15035,Leonard,keep going.
15039,Leonard,told you.
15045,Leonard,that’ll be all. that was fun.
15060,Leonard,switzerland. and i get to bring a guest!
15062,Leonard,"sheldon, you got a minute?"
15067,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’ve been dreaming about spending valentine’s day with a girl since i was six."
15090,Leonard,seriously?
15092,Leonard,what’s going on?
15099,Leonard,some what?
15103,Leonard,i don’t need to see your presentation. this discussion is over!
15117,Leonard,"yeah, i forgot about all this."
15130,Leonard,that’s bruce lee.
15133,Leonard,"yeah, okay. no."
15137,Leonard,for what?
15138,Leonard,so tell him to apologize.
15142,Leonard,"yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
15145,Leonard,why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff?
15146,Leonard,"one more floor, and i’d be the pulled muscle."
15156,Leonard,what?
15157,Leonard,oh.
15158,Leonard,and in the darkness bind them.
15163,Leonard,"guys, it’s stolen. it should go back to peter jackson. he made the movies, it belongs to him."
15167,Leonard,you always get your way.
15175,Leonard,no.
15183,Leonard,"all right, it starts now."
15184,Leonard,and it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
15192,Leonard,peter jackson’s office in new zealand. it wasn’t ours.
15193,Leonard,"i came in here, you guys were all sleeping. the ring was on the floor. no one was touching it."
15194,Leonard,"there wasn’t ever going to be a winner. there was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. is that really what you guys want? ‘cause if it is, fine, i don’t want anything to do with you. and i don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but i am not cleaning it up!  my precious."
15199,Leonard,"hey, you didn’t want a slurpee at 7-eleven, you don’t get glasses."
15202,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
15208,Leonard,i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
15209,Leonard,"my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and i’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
15211,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’ll start again."
15215,Leonard,"why don’t i just start? sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
15220,Leonard,for what?
15224,Leonard,you might want to check youtube.
15228,Leonard,did you just quote star wars?
15234,Leonard,"yeah, probably."
15236,Leonard,seriously? you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
15240,Leonard,"no, there was no spat."
15243,Leonard,no.
15247,Leonard,you don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
15251,Leonard,get into what? why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? they’ve been in your life a long time. they make you happy. they deserve to know.
15257,Leonard,"all right, maybe i overreacted. so we’re in two different places emotionally. so what? and maybe i’m a little ahead of you. that’s fine. you know. in fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, i’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
15264,Leonard,"gets us out of our heads. you get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. that’s not what we’re doing tonight. tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
15280,Leonard,"so, you guys want to do something tonight?"
15284,Leonard,since when do you take after-dinner walks?
15285,Leonard,yeah?
15289,Leonard,"i’m not going out tonight, raj."
15292,Leonard,"yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
15297,Leonard,how could you get lost? your phone has gps.
15312,Leonard,i guess not.
15313,Leonard,"d-don’t be silly. we’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
15315,Leonard,"me neither. oh, sheldon seemed think that i would be upset about you hanging out with him. but i just want you to know it’s fine."
15318,Leonard,"no, i don’t want to do it. you can do it."
15319,Leonard,i just took him for shoes.
15321,Leonard,you’re taking him to disneyland?
15324,Leonard,"and don’t let him go on space mountain after he eats. he’ll say he can handle it, but i promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
15327,Leonard,"it’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
15328,Leonard,i was going to see that with him.
15332,Leonard,want a cup of coffee?
15337,Leonard,oh. sure. absolutely.
15338,Leonard,"here’s an idea. i’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
15342,Leonard,why didn’t you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton? i am a huge fan of hers!
15343,Leonard,"okay, fine. where is she going to sleep?"
15345,Leonard,i can’t believe he’s friends with elizabeth plimpton.
15357,Leonard,"me neither. oh, look what i’m reading. it’s you."
15361,Leonard,sure.
15367,Leonard,something his mother taught him.
15368,Leonard,"oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
15374,Leonard,well…
15378,Leonard,how am i betraying you?
15379,Leonard,"yeah, i guess i did."
15380,Leonard,you still have a cold?
15381,Leonard,"are you having trouble sleeping? ‘cause, boy, i was up all night."
15385,Leonard,no.
15400,Leonard,i don’t?
15404,Leonard,leonard.
15406,Leonard,"you heard that, huh?"
15414,Leonard,"no, i didn’t just move in. first we had to iron out a few details. "
15428,Leonard,"not only did sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. or the police. or homeland security."
15429,Leonard,so i did something stupid. i’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. what were you doing seven years ago?
15434,Leonard,"so, we’re good?"
15438,Leonard,"howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility."
15446,Leonard,it’s pretty cool. we’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. i thought you might want to see it.
15449,Leonard,your company?
15450,Leonard,"so, menus."
15451,Leonard,"let me explain what we’re doing here. um, in 1969, the astronauts on apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
15453,Leonard,"uh, that’s a great question, zack."
15455,Leonard,"now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
15456,Leonard,"right. uh yeah, funny. uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. raj, get them some glasses."
15462,Leonard,i’ll help you.
15474,Leonard,"i know. i just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
15477,Leonard,"bummer. anyway, i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
15479,Leonard,"when you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
15480,Leonard,"no, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. especially the whole rodeo thing."
15481,Leonard,"so, that’s it? wham, bam, thank you, leonard?"
15482,Leonard,"how am i supposed to let it go? you used me for sex! morning, mrs. gunderson."
15490,Leonard,"uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
15491,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. we were just in different places in the relationship.
15501,Leonard,so how’s work?
15502,Leonard,"yeah, we all are."
15515,Leonard,"you have any ideas, raj?"
15525,Leonard,how’s that?
15547,Leonard,have you had your appendix out?
15554,Leonard,"and for rajesh koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken mcnuggets."
15558,Leonard,"sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
15559,Leonard,"greetings, whatever the hell you are."
15579,Leonard,whoa!
15581,Leonard,i’m still going to go with you.
15587,Leonard,"penny, steve wozniak was one of the cofounders of apple computer. he and steve jobs started it…"
15592,Leonard,"i can figure this out, let’s see. um, well, beavers eat tree bark. the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon. so, i’ll say cinnamon."
15597,Leonard,did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids? it’s pretty interesting. this guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
15598,Leonard,what?
15601,Leonard,"ah, ah."
15602,Leonard,"so, this is nice. first time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
15608,Leonard,"okay, let me just get right to it. amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
15612,Leonard,really? silence?
15617,Leonard,"i tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
15624,Leonard,"no, i mean since the shamy hit a reef."
15628,Leonard,he got a cat to keep him company.
15638,Leonard,terrific. my-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
15650,Leonard,"yeah, it’s like if alien and predator decided to go partners in a jamba juice."
15651,Leonard,hang on a second. i could have the fruit platter.
15657,Leonard,"yeah, i guessed that."
15659,Leonard,"all right, fine. so you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
15660,Leonard,"okay. well, how about this? kidnap bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
15676,Leonard,didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
15677,Leonard,isn’t that flammable?
15679,Leonard,thank you.
15680,Leonard,so what’s going on with you two?
15686,Leonard,i’m not jealous.
15687,Leonard,probably. what’s your point?
15690,Leonard,that sounds lovely.
15691,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m just not dating someone right now. i don’t need to go to a senior centre."
15693,Leonard,"hey, guys."
15701,Leonard,why don’t you just break up with her?
15705,Leonard,no.
15709,Leonard,what the hell? how long has she been here?
15715,Leonard,yeah. so?
15717,Leonard,you can’t say that anymore.
15721,Leonard,"okay, good luck."
15734,Leonard,"ah, you’re going off the grid."
15736,Leonard,what if she just comes over?
15742,Leonard,"thanks again for doing this, bernadette."
15743,Leonard,hi.
15747,Leonard,whoa!
15752,Leonard,"i guess the difference is, i have some self-respect."
15753,Leonard,it’s relatively new. i just know that i’m not gonna spend time with someone i don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. i’m okay on my own.
15754,Leonard,"look, uh, joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
15756,Leonard,i look forward to it.
15759,Leonard,and your poll numbers just keep dropping.
15774,Leonard,"give me a minute. sheldon,"
15777,Leonard,really? you’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? you know what happens when you yawn in public.
15779,Leonard,"oh, uh, building manager. they have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
15780,Leonard,"no, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
15782,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, no. you just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. come on, i’ll help you. so, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
15791,Leonard,i’m not that white. my great-great grandmother was half cherokee. i know that’s not the right kind of indian but it is something.
15796,Leonard,"uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
15797,Leonard,"okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
15799,Leonard,without.
15800,Leonard,fine. with.
15803,Leonard,"making pretty good time, huh?"
15804,Leonard,no.
15806,Leonard,no-one’s going to ask if i spent the night with raj’s sister.
15807,Leonard,like what?
15819,Leonard,what.
15824,Leonard,"oh, god."
15825,Leonard,where did you get that?
15827,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t need an alibi. nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  thankyou. now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (sheldon writes “i doubt it” on leonard’s whiteboard."
15836,Leonard,"look, i’m sorry raj, but the truth is i was with priya last night."
15838,Leonard,"look, i admit it, i may have crossed a line here, but come on, raj, your sister is a grown woman. to her, i’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
15863,Leonard,"you are beautiful, you know that? you pop, sparkle and buzz electric. i’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
15867,Leonard,could you get that?
15873,Leonard,what are you doing up?
15874,Leonard,really? maybe sleep has met you before.
15876,Leonard,did something happen today that’s bothering you?
15878,Leonard,because you feel guilty?
15879,Leonard,"actually, you don’t have insomnia. you’re sleeping now."
15880,Leonard,you’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
15884,Leonard,i can’t believe you’ve never seen raiders of the lost ark.
15885,Leonard,"when she comes out with eat, pray, run away from a giant boulder, i’ll read it."
15889,Leonard,"relax, it’s five o’clock. the movie doesn’t start till midnight."
15898,Leonard,hugh who?
15901,Leonard,what’s a stadium pal?
15905,Leonard,"calm down, sheldon."
15909,Leonard,short round?
15910,Leonard,"yeah, i know who it is, but why is it me?"
15915,Leonard,yeah.
15916,Leonard,he’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing?
15919,Leonard,yeah.
15925,Leonard,penny kissed me.
15941,Leonard,see? he doesn’t mind.
15944,Leonard,"thanks for the steak, wyatt."
15955,Leonard,what do you want me to do? you started this. do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
15958,Leonard,"i have a list. fyi, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
15960,Leonard,fines?
15961,Leonard,"oh, b-be careful. give him some line. okay, now reel him in."
15966,Leonard,no hurry.
15969,Leonard,i’ll give it a shot.
15970,Leonard,excuse me?
15972,Leonard,i’ll friend you on facebook.
15973,Leonard,"yeah, well, not necessary. we broke up again."
15976,Leonard,hey.
15977,Leonard,you get to play with raj’s big telescope last night?
15979,Leonard,great.
15984,Leonard,"12 years after high school, and i’m still at the nerd table."
15986,Leonard,every idea is better than this idea.
15987,Leonard,suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night. none come to mind.
15989,Leonard,lesser warlord of ka’a.
15992,Leonard,hey.
15995,Leonard,that’s an atom.
16000,Leonard,that happened to you?
16002,Leonard,why me?
16005,Leonard,"yeah, we came to talk to zack. hey, zack."
16013,Leonard,zack?
16018,Leonard,you’re jogging.
16021,Leonard,who else would it be?
16022,Leonard,what makes you think i can convince her?
16027,Leonard,"did i do something? i mean, i tried to be friends with zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
16029,Leonard,not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on new year’s eve.
16034,Leonard,you’re being a bully.
16037,Leonard,"i had a great idea. you know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing fourier analysis, or using the schrodinger equation?"
16053,Leonard,okay. you need to get clear on this right now. i am in charge of this project.
16057,Leonard,it’s not a joke. it’s the real design.
16058,Leonard,"sheldon, i think this will work. let’s just try it my way."
16066,Leonard,"oh sheldon, stop it."
16071,Leonard,but i fired you.
16075,Leonard,"look, i’m still happy to drive you to work. nothing’s changed in that regard. we’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
16080,Leonard,what are you doing?!
16081,Leonard,"no. i mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
16082,Leonard,sheldon! we’re working here!
16084,Leonard,"well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
16113,Leonard,good night.
16128,Leonard,"i found another tweet from a student at sheldon’s lecture. dr. cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. plus, he looks like a giant insect."
16136,Leonard,"i don’t know, i kind of promised howard."
16138,Leonard,"yeah, it’s weird. even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
16142,Leonard,have you seen him?
16143,Leonard,it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.
16145,Leonard,"i guess it depends on the zombies, raj. are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? like, in 28 days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
16158,Leonard,you’re kidding. that was good for you? ‘cause i was sweating through my t-shirt.
16159,Leonard,why?
16163,Leonard,"excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. i’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, i received a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physics."
16164,Leonard,that was a great meal.
16170,Leonard,"terrific. great. what level is that?  okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
16178,Leonard,what?
16180,Leonard,"well, forget it! it’s not gonna happen."
16185,Leonard,are you insane? i’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
16186,Leonard,"good night, sheldon."
16190,Leonard,really?
16200,Leonard,what?
16201,Leonard,"oh, nothing’s going on. excuse me."
16210,Leonard,howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. he had a fight with his mother.
16214,Leonard,hold on. when did priya get here?
16230,Leonard,"what, with my tongue in your tail?"
16238,Leonard,i guess you’re right. see you later.
16245,Leonard,right.
16246,Leonard,"oh, sounds great."
16248,Leonard,just sit here.
16252,Leonard,really? levar burton’s coming here?
16254,Leonard,of course. good night.
16264,Leonard,bam. right in the nose. made me proud to own a pc.
16268,Leonard,"aw, hell, i miss him."
16282,Leonard,thank you.
16285,Leonard,"oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? that is so cruel."
16290,Leonard,oh. okay.
16291,Leonard,"no, no, i’m confident. it’s not like i’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. although, this will be the first time i’ll be the one saying it."
16297,Leonard,no?
16298,Leonard,yeah.
16300,Leonard,"yeah, bitches are the worst."
16301,Leonard,"uh, penny, there’s something i have to tell you."
16303,Leonard,no.
16304,Leonard,"all right, well, anyway, darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
16309,Leonard,"oh, yes. indeed, i did."
16310,Leonard,she completely understood everything i said. case closed.
16313,Leonard,what?
16317,Leonard,no.
16328,Leonard,"of course, i did. i talked and talked and talked."
16332,Leonard,"uh, i kind of have a problem i was hoping you could help me with."
16333,Leonard,move out.
16347,Leonard,you called the police because someone hacked your world of warcraft account?
16356,Leonard,"okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
16358,Leonard,"well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
16361,Leonard,that’s not where it was going.
16362,Leonard,"oh, wait. hang on. are you upset?"
16364,Leonard,did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
16372,Leonard,"oh, geez, i don’t know if i can ditch priya two nights in a row."
16373,Leonard,"aw, screw it. i’m in."
16375,Leonard,"hit the… hey, sweetie. yeah, i’m sorry. i’m gonna be working late. i, i, i miss you, too. okay, sure, i’ll call you when i get home. okay, bye-bye."
16377,Leonard,i can’t believe we’re going all the way to san diego to confront this guy.
24581,Penny,okay.
24583,Penny,"oh, so i spent seventh grade dotting my i’s with little asses? cool."
24588,Penny,"no, no. but in this case, yes."
24600,Penny,i’m suggesting there might be something you could do about amy’s urges?
24608,Penny,"you know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. shame on all of you. "
24615,Penny,"wait, why me? wh-why can’t your girlfriend be wonder woman?"
24626,Penny,"no. wait, wait, does it?"
24631,Penny,"i’m not going to that party, leonard."
24632,Penny,it’s not the wig.
24636,Penny,like there’s a difference.
24639,Penny,are you high?
24641,Penny,what idea?
24644,Penny,bored.
24645,Penny,"hey, wait a minute."
24649,Penny,oh.
24652,Penny,is that so?
24653,Penny,aw.
24663,Penny,"no, sorry."
24664,Penny,what does that mean?
24667,Penny,"look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?"
24670,Penny,"oh, yes. he says they are lost without you."
24673,Penny,say you’re sorry.
24675,Penny,no?
24685,Penny,the what?
24708,Penny,"you know what? i missed you, too."
24709,Penny,will do.
24712,Penny,really?
24724,Penny,sleep.
24732,Penny,i really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
24738,Penny,"good night. you know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the neutral zone for just one night. oh!"
24749,Penny,you want an acting lesson?
24751,Penny,"yeah, i saw those. they were funny. i printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge."
24761,Penny,"so i just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. you know, just do whatever feels natural. sheldon?"
24762,Penny,"come on, you got to work with me. we need to get connected with our bodies."
24764,Penny,okay. one of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. so why don’t we try some improvisation?
24765,Penny,this is all about listening and responding.
24771,Penny,"um, okay, sure. luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
24789,Penny,"greetings, mary cooper. i am spock."
24803,Penny,"leonard, are you okay?"
24806,Penny,what was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
24808,Penny,"good morning, slut."
24811,Penny,i believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
24814,Penny,"oh, yeah, you, too."
24819,Penny,"really, i am not upset about leonard and priya."
24832,Penny,thank you.
24842,Penny,"oh. hey, sheldon. what can i get ya?"
24843,Penny,where are all your friends?
24849,Penny,"oh. hi, amy. how you been?"
24864,Penny,"okay, let’s go through this one more time. just because leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean i need to go out and hook up with some guy."
24868,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. you know, for the first time in my life, i am not in a relationship, and i’m totally okay with it."
24870,Penny,"oh, it’s a snowflake from the north pole. leonard gave it to me last year."
24879,Penny,"you know, well, i’m happy leonard’s found someone. not that anybody asked."
24881,Penny,"aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how i got his nose."
24888,Penny,"no, that’s silk. seriously, what would you do without me?"
24894,Penny,then no.
24900,Penny,"so, how’s the food here? oh, wow, that is really, really good. oh, i’m sorry. you guys are on a date. we can hang out anytime. have fun."
24901,Penny,"oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! whoo! it really sneaks up on ya, huh? all right, i gotta go."
24902,Penny,"oh, hey, i was just on my way to work."
24904,Penny,"sure, anything."
24906,Penny,"okay, i’m not moving anywhere. what the hell is this all about?"
24912,Penny,"leonard, i get it. you’re in a new relationship now. and i’m happy for you. so why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?"
24915,Penny,hey.
24917,Penny,"okay, well, anyways, i brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"
24918,Penny,just say thank you.
24919,Penny,all right. see you later.
24921,Penny,"yeah, well, sadly, i do."
24933,Penny,"no problem. so, leonard, i think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you."
24937,Penny,how come?
24938,Penny,all right. hang on.
24943,Penny,going to see leonard?
24946,Penny,amy’s right. i do want to fling my poop at her.
24955,Penny,in confidence!
24957,Penny,"hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
24959,Penny,"well, i know that. how do you know that?"
24970,Penny,"okay, i’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out."
24971,Penny,i felt sorry for him. priya’s giving him a hard time.
24973,Penny,that’s too many s’s for kissing.
24976,Penny,"hey, i know, let’s take sheldon dancing."
24983,Penny,i’m fine.
24989,Penny,"okay, i don’t know you people. i’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my texaco card."
25001,Penny,"look, just find out what’s up with this trip to india."
25003,Penny,"hey, do me a favour and take table seven."
25015,Penny,okay.
25017,Penny,"oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs."
25036,Penny,"hey, you guys ready to order?"
25038,Penny,"yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. do not believe it."
25042,Penny,thanks. wow! what’s with the fancy spread?
25044,Penny,"all right, let me try this again. where’s leonard?"
25045,Penny,"woah, leonard and priya are living together? that’s big."
25052,Penny,"really? even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
25059,Penny,"coming. yup, that’s good. wine glasses should have handles."
25065,Penny,you know what? let’s get out of here.
25068,Penny,"yeah, sure. yay!"
25071,Penny,"you know, i don’t even know what the point of me staying in l.a. is. i haven’t gotten a single acting job since i moved out here. the closest i came was last month, i got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
25075,Penny,thanks.
25083,Penny,"so, we didn’t actually…"
25085,Penny,"of course i won’t. no, i won’t."
25092,Penny,mm-hmm?
25105,Penny,"it’s great, isn’t it?"
25111,Penny,i went into this marriage with so much hope.
25114,Penny,yeah. it’s cleaner than my couch. found half a hot pocket in there.
25123,Penny,you’re kidding.
25124,Penny,and now me.
25132,Penny,"wait. get up, get up!  swear you won’t tell sheldon what happened!"
25139,Penny,aw. so handsome. like james bond.
25141,Penny,put the corsage on her.
25142,Penny,"ames, hi. how was the wedding?"
25154,Penny,"um, raj, there’s someone i want you to meet. this is my friend emily. i know her from my spin class. raj, relax. she can’t hear you. she’s deaf."
25157,Penny,is raj out with emily again?
25158,Penny,"wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
25162,Penny,"wait, hang on. doubles. roll again."
25163,Penny,"what do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
25164,Penny,"well, so how much is that?"
25169,Penny,"i can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. oh, here she comes."
25177,Penny,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
25180,Penny,"i know, i know."
25191,Penny,"okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
25196,Penny,"good, good."
25199,Penny,"oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. now i’m going out tonight. would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit i’m going to wear?"
25201,Penny,this is like the worst hollywood tour ever.
25202,Penny,"hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
25205,Penny,"hey, guys."
25212,Penny,"okay, well, i’d offer you halloween candy, but that’s gone. so, what’s up?"
25216,Penny,it’s okay.
25218,Penny,"yeah, probably."
25228,Penny,what does your gut tell you?
25229,Penny,"so, bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
25232,Penny,"all right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
25254,Penny,"okay, yeah."
25262,Penny,"oh, leonard."
25264,Penny,what do you mean?
25269,Penny,"great. i’ll see you later. and remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him."
25274,Penny,you pick plenty of movies.
25277,Penny,"okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
25280,Penny,no. no woman would.
25282,Penny,"no, i was thinking how come they get to leave and i can’t."
25283,Penny,"uh, no, thanks."
25287,Penny,what you writing there?
25292,Penny,so have you written anything i might have seen?
25295,Penny,what am i doing?
25299,Penny,you should.
25302,Penny,"oh, no, no. we said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out."
25303,Penny,"oh, he had to leave."
25304,Penny,"huh? i’m sorry, get what?"
25306,Penny,"oh. okay, i see. so while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two star trek uniforms?"
25307,Penny,yeah. wears them. not just for halloween.
25310,Penny,did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
25313,Penny,"all right. thank you. i’m sorry, too."
25321,Penny,"hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and i turned out just fine. hey, look, i have peach schnapps. thank god."
25324,Penny,"oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a sheldon. so do you like stuart?"
25327,Penny,"hello, sheldon. come on in."
25332,Penny,"all right, honey, let me tell you a story. there was a guy i liked, and i never told him how i felt. eventually, he started going out with someone else, and i always regretted it. do you see where i’m going with this?"
25336,Penny,"look, sheldon, all i’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to amy."
25340,Penny,what’s yours?
25343,Penny,"all right, well, what do you think he wants?"
25351,Penny,"no, we weren’t really like that. i mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. like, okay, this one girl, kathy geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
25358,Penny,both.
25361,Penny,"okay, come on, i don’t even have my own house, i’m going to build one for someone else?"
25363,Penny,and helping people.
25376,Penny,"so, are we ready to order?"
25378,Penny,"okay, amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
25394,Penny,you look beautiful.
25401,Penny,i don’t know.
25405,Penny,"absolutely not. look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
25419,Penny,you are so funny.
25431,Penny,do not overthink this.  
25442,Penny,"well, we don’t really have to pretend."
25443,Penny,"okay, great. hey, i just remembered. i still got one of your inhalers."
25458,Penny,"uh, have you thought this through?"
25467,Penny,all right. let’s give it a shot.
25478,Penny,it’s open.
25483,Penny,"yeah. oh. here’s my list for you, right there."
25492,Penny,things are looking good.
25495,Penny,"sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do i know?"
25496,Penny,"because last month, i sent the electric company a starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
25506,Penny,leonard’s day?
25510,Penny,"you know, i’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. that’s how i told my high school boyfriend i slept with his brother. that’s how i told his brother the same thing."
25511,Penny,"oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for."
25515,Penny,"so you’re saying if i became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
25518,Penny,"hey, what are you guys doing here?"
25519,Penny,no and no. everything okay with you and bernadette?
25521,Penny,you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
25526,Penny,wow. i-i don’t know what to s… wow.
25531,Penny,so ugly. what am i gonna do?
25534,Penny,how about i tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
25543,Penny,"no. no, no. it’s just, it’s a little big."
25548,Penny,i know.
25551,Penny,"amy, come on…"
25558,Penny,"well, what about bernadette?"
25561,Penny,"yeah, okay. that’s, uh, that’s good."
25562,Penny,mm.
25564,Penny,"you’re talking about the painting, right?"
25569,Penny,so did i win or not?
25573,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry, i don’t understand."
25580,Penny,"all right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? i’ve taken you to disneyland, i kicked a bully in the nuts for you, i sing you soft kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."
25594,Penny,"sorry, stallion. your weird friend giraffe is here."
25601,Penny,"amy, what’s wrong?"
25605,Penny,mm.
25609,Penny,"mm. you know, amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
25613,Penny,"whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. hold on. "
25614,Penny,wars.
25620,Penny,"that’s why you’re lucky to have me. back in omaha, there are two different restaurants i’m not allowed into. both chili’s."
25622,Penny,"ooh, burn!"
25625,Penny,oh.
25627,Penny,"and that’s how a girl makes a scene. i’m sorry, sweetie. you’re right. you deserve your weekend. come on, amy, let’s go."
25629,Penny,"oh my god, i love this chicken."
25634,Penny,"anyway, i got a little residual cheque from my commercial and i thought, hey, how about i get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. so, sheldon, ta-da!"
25637,Penny,"ooh, am i about to get a rare sheldon cooper hug?"
25647,Penny,what is your problem?
25649,Penny,yes.
25660,Penny,"i don’t understand, why doesn’t howard just introduce you to the guy?"
25662,Penny,"i know what it means. and yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
25667,Penny,"so, i hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
25669,Penny,"oh, come on leonard, it’s you. what’s going to happen? i mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
25670,Penny,really? what is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? and the time you and i had sex in the ocean does not count.
25673,Penny,"yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
25674,Penny,"okay, show’s over."
25685,Penny,hey.
25692,Penny,"if you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet."
25697,Penny,"okay. me, me, me. ready?  leonard, i am your father."
25698,Penny,"oh, mm. hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
25703,Penny,who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
25705,Penny,"no, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
25708,Penny,you’re kidding.
25712,Penny,"okay, you, too."
25717,Penny,no!
25718,Penny,"amy, you look great."
25719,Penny,it wasn’t a real proposal.
25725,Penny,problem?
25732,Penny,just a couple of minutes. you’ve really never done this before?
25740,Penny,"ah, thank you!"
25745,Penny,"no, we don’t! come on in!"
25747,Penny,"all right, who’s ready for another beer?"
25748,Penny,girls.
25751,Penny,raj.
25755,Penny,what about me what?
25758,Penny,"yeah, sure, of course i love him."
25764,Penny,"amy, you?"
25776,Penny,"okay, honey, i have a lot to figure out, and until i do, you are not to say a word to leonard. do you understand?"
25778,Penny,what?
25781,Penny,what the hell is wrong with you? you told sheldon? do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
25782,Penny,really?
25783,Penny,mmm.
25785,Penny,"look, there’s something i need to tell you."
25786,Penny,i don’t really know how to say this.
25788,Penny,"i didn’t know what else to do. he had those big, sad eyes."
25790,Penny,"look, it’s fine. we’re not getting married, okay? we’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis."
25797,Penny,"oh, disgusting."
25799,Penny,sorry!
25804,Penny,"a proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. i’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t i?"
25805,Penny,"okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. you just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."
25806,Penny,"who i hope for her sake is not captain hook, so… who are you calling?"
25811,Penny,"well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking."
25812,Penny,"amy, this is crazy. you have nothing to be suspicious about."
25814,Penny,what are you doing?
25822,Penny,wow. anything else?
25824,Penny,"oh, it’s about time. i hated the old way. hi. i’m penny."
25825,Penny,in a way. we’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
25832,Penny,"okay. ready, set, go."
25838,Penny,"all right, that’s enough. "
25844,Penny,"oh, come on, what is that?"
25845,Penny,"no, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game."
25848,Penny,i don’t think so.
25861,Penny,letting him make me happy.
25863,Penny,"yeah, that’s kind of a problem."
25865,Penny,"yeah, i’m not really clear on what that means."
25867,Penny,anybody home?
25874,Penny,"ah. danger. sure, sure. yeah. what’s, what’s that?"
25876,Penny,"ooh, low-techie-techie. so, what are you working on right now?"
25878,Penny,sharp. thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
25888,Penny,whoa! that is very cool.
25898,Penny,"no, i’m not embarrassed. i just didn’t want anyone to know because i haven’t told leonard yet."
25899,Penny,"because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can i help?” and “i’m so proud of you.” ugh!"
25910,Penny,thank you.
25914,Penny,"elves? come on, leonard. it’s too early for lord of the rings."
25927,Penny,"so, i know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, i will beat you both with a bag of oranges."
25932,Penny,"no, i’m a terrible waitress, remember?"
25933,Penny,"yeah, right."
25936,Penny,"wow, excuse me."
25964,Penny,did your boyfriend make you type that?
25966,Penny,"no, he’s not. we’re just friends. look, is this gonna be a problem? because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work."
25968,Penny,"hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"
25972,Penny,what is your problem? do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
25978,Penny,"hey, anybody want a drink?"
25989,Penny,thanks. ah!
26004,Penny,"oh, look, it’s a female. you can see all the eggs. "
26007,Penny,of course you did. your hands are softer than veal.
26013,Penny,"wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. and not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of pabst."
26017,Penny,"of course he is. look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. she’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is slumdog millionaire. i mean."
26019,Penny,ooh!
26024,Penny,you’re talking about leonard.
26025,Penny,"wait, what the hell’s going on with leonard and alex?"
26032,Penny,mm-hmm. anything else?
26033,Penny,that’s great.
26039,Penny,"oh, damn it, you are."
26042,Penny,no.
26044,Penny,why are you smiling?
26054,Penny,"i know, right? watch this. molecules."
26060,Penny,"well, then why are you going?"
26061,Penny,"all right. well, you guys have fun. i guess i’ll see you sunday night."
26063,Penny,what was that for?
26071,Penny,"well then, what do you recommend?"
26079,Penny,i know. a hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
26081,Penny,"okay, hang on, what if thor’s hand is on the hammer? i mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean i could lift it?"
26082,Penny,"well, which is it?"
26084,Penny,"wait, i thought we were reading."
26085,Penny,yes!
26087,Penny,"if harry potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t thor’s hammer?"
26108,Penny,"yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. like burt and ernie. you guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."
26109,Penny,wow. where are you going to go?
26113,Penny,"um, well, um, all right. you, you know how in harry potter and the half-blood prince, ron didn’t abandon harry just because harry started dating ron’s sister?"
26122,Penny,really? interesting.
26123,Penny,it’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
26124,Penny,"yes. that is a real thing. and it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine."
26125,Penny,"well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings."
26129,Penny,"no, i don’t want to break his heart. i love him. this is just happening too fast."
26141,Penny,"this old guy was choking on his food, and i saved his life."
26142,Penny,"no. i said, oh, my god, i think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys heimlich’ed him."
26143,Penny,"yeah, that was the point of the story."
26148,Penny,this place is really beautiful.
26150,Penny,no problem. we just sat down.
26161,Penny,"oh, i can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with."
26163,Penny,"yes, absolutely. now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. i totally taught him that."
26165,Penny,"yeah, yeah, i know."
26168,Penny,what?
26177,Penny,"yeah, you got it."
26191,Penny,really?
26196,Penny,"you should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to."
26207,Penny,"yeah, that’s a toughie."
26212,Penny,yeah.
26215,Penny,"ooh, it smells good."
26219,Penny,it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
26239,Penny,"this turned out pretty well, huh?"
26243,Penny,you can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
26253,Penny,"oh, then you all can get tenure."
26255,Penny,no.
26268,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t be like that."
26270,Penny,"yeah, it was fun. kind of reminded me of my high school. but instead of vampires, we had meth heads. but both came out at night and had messed up teeth."
26273,Penny,"yippee, it’s backwards. i get it."
26274,Penny,"i don’t know. it’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. i just don’t get that way. do you?"
26278,Penny,"so, i was thinking how excited you get about stuff like buffy or science or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy."
26279,Penny,"see, that’s the kind of passion i didn’t think i had. but then i realized i’m passionate about you."
26283,Penny,"leonard, i had an epiphany, not a stroke."
26291,Penny,hello.
26294,Penny,"okay, i didn’t know."
26297,Penny,"shut up. you can do that? i mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?"
26302,Penny,we’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
26313,Penny,"you know what? give me the dice, i want to roll."
26326,Penny,whoa. when would you leave?
26328,Penny,on a ship? aren’t they afraid hawking will just roll overboard?
26332,Penny,sure.
26334,Penny,"sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
26335,Penny,"bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
26336,Penny,"you know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
26340,Penny,"well, i’m his girlfriend, of course i’m gonna support him."
26351,Penny,"i’m gonna miss you, too."
26361,Penny,oh. i’m so sorry.
26362,Penny,"oh, raj."
26366,Penny,you’re talking to me.
26373,Penny,you know what? that would make me feel better. thank you.
26374,Penny,no.
26376,Penny,mmm.
26378,Penny,"all right, let’s just get this stupid game over with."
26380,Penny,why?
26389,Penny,"leonard, leonard? i cannot believe we were missing that jerk."
26397,Penny,"oh, that’s really sweet."
26407,Penny,okay.
26414,Penny,come on.
26416,Penny,another? great.
26422,Penny,"oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?"
26425,Penny,ah.
26441,Penny,"okay. look, honey, i promise there’s no one’s here. i‘ve had a long day. i just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
26447,Penny,it was fine.
26449,Penny,"oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
26456,Penny,aw.
26469,Penny,"but, it, it doesn’t matter. we know the answer, come on."
26474,Penny,riddle me this…
26492,Penny,but wait. so does this one.
26501,Penny,yeah. it’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
26502,Penny,"oh, cool. are there pictures?"
26505,Penny,"oh, my god, you still go left."
26509,Penny,"okay, okay. but you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, i think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
26511,Penny,"sweetie, i’m so sorry. i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better."
26512,Penny,really? are you sure about that?
26514,Penny,"oh, come on. every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. it’s like, it’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. i mean…"
26522,Penny,"oh, just a little treat. i know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
26523,Penny,"and i wanted to make you feel better, so i planned something very special for you."
26532,Penny,why’d you get that? you hate lamb.
26534,Penny,yeah.
26536,Penny,"nope, got to go with amy on this one."
26540,Penny,"uh, sheldon, you want to take a break? your food’s ready."
26541,Penny,"aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
26542,Penny,ah.
26550,Penny,"okay, good, ’cause i’ve been really struggling with this."
26552,Penny,"i don’t know if i want to cook for him. he’s kind of a picky eater. i mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
26554,Penny,that’s from say anything.
26560,Penny,what?
26561,Penny,"i discovered a secret ingredient. the flavour packet. that sucker is well named. all right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."
26562,Penny,"oh, i am. maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why."
26566,Penny,what?
26568,Penny,"oh, my god, i am the worst."
26570,Penny,of course i did. it’s you.
26573,Penny,"good, i’m just having little trouble with the glue."
26579,Penny,what’s going on with them?
26594,Penny,"yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
26599,Penny,"yeah, well, you’re short."
26603,Penny,"yeah, this is none of my business. but why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
26605,Penny,"i’m sorry, this is rude of me. i will go get that water. see, see, see, see. just now you expressed your feelings to my face. how come you could do that with me, but not raj?"
26610,Penny,"well, i was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, i want to say salmon."
26613,Penny,what are you doing?
26616,Penny,"oh, my god! is that sweater made of bees? come on, take it off. i won’t tell."
26618,Penny,smile.
26629,Penny,"sheldon, you can have a nice thanksgiving anywhere. i spent one in vegas."
26656,Penny,"yeah, we could’ve waited till monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
26660,Penny,"how can you not be happy? you’re tall, thin and famous. oh, my god, i’m jealous of sheldon."
26666,Penny,"it’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
26668,Penny,"you know, if it makes you feel any better…"
26669,Penny,you’re probably right.
26672,Penny,"hey, sheldon, you want to play next?"
26674,Penny,"wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
26675,Penny,"yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template."
26677,Penny,"honey, i’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for christmas i was thinking of giving you this."
26687,Penny,a few minutes it is.
26692,Penny,"sure, why?"
26693,Penny,why? 
26697,Penny,"oh, come on. childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half."
26702,Penny,"okay, that’s enough."
26708,Penny,great.
26715,Penny,"guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this."
26722,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet of you, but i was gonna steal food from here. you know, my treat."
26723,Penny,we haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
26726,Penny,"well, the diner scene. where’s my diner scene?"
26729,Penny,"this doesn’t make any sense. i mean, i, i thought i did a, a really good job, i… excuse me."
26733,Penny,then what did you mean?
26735,Penny,"i want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion."
26755,Penny,"really? ‘cause this morning at starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. and it wasn’t the only one in there."
26759,Penny,did you seriously just say um?
26768,Penny,"listen, i don’t want to break up with you."
26769,Penny,"yeah, i probably wouldn’t."
26770,Penny,"look, you did the right thing last night. i was a mess. i was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
26780,Penny,"come on, boy. come on. let’s go. let’s go. get in the car. come on."
26790,Penny,"yeah, i need to start cracking the window when i leave you in the car."
26794,Penny,"i’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
26802,Penny,"well, it’s scary for me, too."
26807,Penny,"yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
26811,Penny,and we’re back to the first kind of sad.
26817,Penny,i can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
26821,Penny,"okay, so i’m an adult, and the other day i saw an old man slip and fall down, and i laughed. i mean, i laughed hard. like, like, out loud. if he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
26827,Penny,"oh, come on, it wasn’t me. anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
26837,Penny,should we take this little party to the bedroom?
26844,Penny,okay. there’s one not far from here. come on. let’s go.
26851,Penny,"yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long."
26862,Penny,just shut up.
26866,Penny,"ooh, this one looks nice."
26869,Penny,"all right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too."
26870,Penny,no buts. you got to stop letting him boss you around.
26874,Penny,"well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot."
26879,Penny,are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
26880,Penny,"okay, i have not tried to change leonard. that’s just what happens in relationships. look how much amy’s changed you."
26882,Penny,"of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life."
26886,Penny,"well, i’m glad you’re still together."
26891,Penny,"aw, thank you."
26896,Penny,"okay, i don’t think meryl streep ever had to say “must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”"
26899,Penny,"remember the old days when i would’ve said something dumb like why? uh, that doesn’t sound good."
26910,Penny,it’s just so humiliating.
26925,Penny,"sorry. hey, who’s not the murderer?"
26933,Penny,"yeah, but if i become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money."
26953,Penny,i’m liking my odds here.
26956,Penny,"no, i didn’t get it."
26957,Penny,"i kind of did. the part in that awful horror movie i passed on came back around. apparently, it’s mine if i want it."
26971,Penny,"unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal."
26975,Penny,i wouldn’t exactly call star trek embarrassing.
26981,Penny,great. not like regret at all.
27004,Penny,"okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
27007,Penny,"but i realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. so, i asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
27015,Penny,what can we do that’s free?
27017,Penny,"uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
27019,Penny,"come on, anything can happen. we can push him down the stairs."
27020,Penny,yep.
27027,Penny,shut up.
27032,Penny,"hey, i don’t understand why you’re not upset with amy."
27036,Penny,how is that not good?
27041,Penny,"no, come on, tonight we are trying new things."
27043,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake. look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
27051,Penny,"so, when is it?"
27052,Penny,"oh, no. this face wasn’t because i didn’t get it."
27063,Penny,"i didn’t know him very well, but i still really liked him. it’s weird that he’s just gone."
27067,Penny,toy story 3?
27071,Penny,you think about dying?
27072,Penny,what would you regret?
27084,Penny,this isn’t funny anymore. just say no so we’re done with this. will you marry me or not?
27085,Penny,no.
27086,Penny,you know what? fine. do whatever you want.
27087,Penny,thank you.
27093,Penny,go away. just go away.
27101,Penny,"you know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
27107,Penny,it was over a bowling alley.
27112,Penny,"oh, my god. what a day."
27113,Penny,no. i need to start making some smart decisions.
27116,Penny,i am.
27120,Penny,"sweetie, you can be any pastry you want."
27138,Penny,"okay, then, yeah."
27145,Penny,"well, leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
27150,Penny,"he can take care of himself. look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
27159,Penny,"leonard, we can’t protect him forever."
27178,Penny,"oh, thank you, but maybe i should cancel."
27182,Penny,people. yes.
27183,Penny,"uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. i mean, believe me, i convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. i mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump."
27185,Penny,"um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? no. okay, i’m really sorry for wasting your time."
27191,Penny,"oh, my god, no."
27193,Penny,i thought your phone got stolen.
27205,Penny,"i told you, they’ll be right out."
27207,Penny,i’m sorry. i just need a little break from her.
27219,Penny,"what, you? really?"
27227,Penny,isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
27241,Penny,"look, i don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something i’m already worried about."
27243,Penny,it does?
27247,Penny,"oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad."
27250,Penny,can he really throw a ball?
27252,Penny,hi.
27254,Penny,"oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
27255,Penny,i don’t know. i kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
27261,Penny,yeah.
27263,Penny,thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. i really appreciate it.
27268,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry. did we get off on the wrong foot? because since the other night, i kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
27276,Penny,you told emily we hooked up?
27281,Penny,"i don’t know what emily’s so upset about anyway. even if i had slept with him, so what? everyone has a past."
27283,Penny,it’s not.
27291,Penny,"oh. well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
27293,Penny,hi.
27294,Penny,"oh, thank you for coming."
27308,Penny,nah.
27310,Penny,oh. okay.
27313,Penny,"oh, you will. that’s why they give you the bucket. uh-oh."
27323,Penny,to the walk-in closet? sure.
27324,Penny,yep. shake that thing.
27330,Penny,you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
27331,Penny,"i’m sorry, i was thinking about work."
27337,Penny,"oh, come on, leonard, i know the car was a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both."
27343,Penny,"sweetie, i can buy my own stuff. i have a good job now."
27346,Penny,hi. sure.
27347,Penny,"oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
27350,Penny,"you know what, that’s great. i love that."
27352,Penny,"oh, thank you so much. it feels so good to hear you say that. and i want you to know that i get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and i’m trying to be sensitive to that."
27356,Penny,you know what? i’m sorry. it’s stupid to fight over money.
27361,Penny,"oh, don’t apologize."
27368,Penny,"okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."
27369,Penny,"same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear."
27370,Penny,"okay, if it’s sometimes howie wears yours, leonard already told us."
27385,Penny,"okay. whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. you got to get rid of him."
27388,Penny,"so, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
27394,Penny,just walk.
27408,Penny,"okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
27410,Penny,"okay, okay."
27413,Penny,"well, now i can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch."
27417,Penny,"okay, just one question. what?"
27418,Penny,"here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with amy?"
27422,Penny,"sheldon, doesn’t amy look hot? that’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
27434,Penny,want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
27435,Penny,"i know, me, too. but it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
27437,Penny,"yeah, i watched. it was like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka."
27456,Penny,"okay, that’s morbid. send it back."
27460,Penny,i’ll be right there. bernadette’s just parking the car.
27461,Penny,come on. she’s not that bad.
27475,Penny,even though your dress is ugly.
27478,Penny,"uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
27485,Penny,"me, too."
27489,Penny,"yes, we did."
27499,Penny,"honey, it’s christmas eve. who even knows you’re in there?"
27500,Penny,so erase them and walk out.
27518,Penny,is there any part of your body that’s normal?
27522,Penny,"no, you’re right, we should do what you do. have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston."
27524,Penny,"uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. hey, can i ask you something?"
27531,Penny,"sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready."
27532,Penny,don’t tell amy that. we’ll be here every sunday.
27537,Penny,is that why you had to take him to office depot last night?
27542,Penny,"oh, i’m just doing this awful workout. i hate it."
27544,Penny,"the exercise, sheldon. shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?"
27545,Penny,"uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?"
27546,Penny,"so, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to hawaii."
27548,Penny,really? want to go to hawaii?
27550,Penny,what’s up?
27557,Penny,date night.
27565,Penny,"and you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. so, how’s the detector going?"
27569,Penny,"okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you."
27570,Penny,"oh, god. probably nothing. i think i saw the director twirling a sign outside the verizon store."
27575,Penny,"okay, we’ve seen plenty."
27578,Penny,you look like a talking cupcake.
27585,Penny,please show us?
27586,Penny,you know i’m gonna read it either way.
27588,Penny,"maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. a man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
27591,Penny,"cooper told amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. he asked her if she had any questions. all she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
27595,Penny,"no, it is. does he stay? do they kiss? does she find out about montana?"
27599,Penny,as he stood for amelia to dry him…
27601,Penny,you okay?
27604,Penny,"oh, that sounds like a good thing."
27606,Penny,"well, i’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
27609,Penny,"well, you could shove them somewhere."
27614,Penny,"okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
27621,Penny,i can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
27622,Penny,why would she even do this?
27623,Penny,make this interesting? you bet money on me?
27626,Penny,get out.
27628,Penny,"oh, hey. did you see that? i, i figured out how to open the door all by myself. maybe i’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."
27634,Penny,unbelievable.
27635,Penny,really? you couldn’t get it out?
27636,Penny,"eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings."
27643,Penny,"raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with emily?"
27644,Penny,"oh, careful. you’re poking at the whole foundation of the bachelor."
27645,Penny,what? you’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
27647,Penny,i’m not gonna fall in love with sheldon.
27655,Penny,"uh, well, i’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
27666,Penny,really? you always seem so confident.
27673,Penny,"so, why did you finally tell me?"
27678,Penny,and begin. this is kind of creepy.
27679,Penny,sorry.
27690,Penny,i just want to make sure you get there safe.
27696,Penny,okay.
27697,Penny,this is why i’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
27698,Penny,yes.
27706,Penny,"whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off."
27710,Penny,"i’m not even sure why we were out of breath. uh, i mean, did we move at all?"
27714,Penny,how did you get paint in your eye?
27715,Penny,we sure did.
27719,Penny,"yeah. we could give it to sheldon, and tell him william shatner painted it."
27721,Penny,"if it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"
27731,Penny,and that’s why you get an ipad helicopter.
27732,Penny,"i know, i know."
27735,Penny,this food is amazing.
27741,Penny,"guys, if i wanted to hear people be bitchy, i’d go to my real salon."
27748,Penny,"oh, i meant beer pong."
27751,Penny,"yeah, it’s also like when the mountain fought the red viper in game of thrones."
27754,Penny,wow.
27758,Penny,it’s in your purse. play.
27760,Penny,those are star trek people.
27762,Penny,sorry.
27768,Penny,"hey, kevin. it’s really exciting to talk to you."
27770,Penny,aw.
27771,Penny,seriously?
27776,Penny,"i don’t know, i make a movie, become rich and famous, win an oscar, a golden globe and live an incredibly wonderful life."
27784,Penny,don’t you have a guy?
27795,Penny,you’re really not gonna tell me?
27796,Penny,"okay. sheldon, let me ask you a question."
27800,Penny,"oh, i guess you’re right. maybe it is the person who asks."
27824,Penny,"so, that’s it? we’re not going?"
27838,Penny,"oh. well, you do."
27840,Penny,add a belt and i’ll take you some place nice.
27850,Penny,"hey, sorry, got caught up at work. hi, beverly."
27853,Penny,"ah, yeah, now that’s what i’m talking about."
27855,Penny,really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. i think.
27858,Penny,mm-hmm.
27861,Penny,"of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
27863,Penny,"well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
27866,Penny,"oh, my god."
27868,Penny,"oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
27870,Penny,okay. were you talking before she got upset?
27878,Penny,that carrot was delicious.
27880,Penny,"hey, i don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship."
27882,Penny,"uh, hello."
27885,Penny,"yeah, it’s just, things are good right now."
27888,Penny,yeah.
27891,Penny,"not in a rush, busy with work…"
27894,Penny,"well, you want a date, pick a date."
27896,Penny,i doubt it.
27900,Penny,stay out of it.
27903,Penny,here we go again. why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? we’re committed to each other. we’re happy. a ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
27906,Penny,vegas isn’t that far away.
27910,Penny,yeah. this is crazy.
27920,Penny,all right.
27926,Penny,"uh, keep your mouth off other women."
27930,Penny,"okay, that’s enough. stop talking."
27935,Penny,why would we want that?
27940,Penny,"uh, actually i’m in vegas. leonard and i are about to get married."
27949,Penny,"oh, my god, would you stop bringing it up?"
27958,Penny,"well, i don’t have any. you’re kind of making me look bad."
27960,Penny,wow.
27961,Penny,"right. um, okay. leonard, i mean, you’re not only the love of my life. i mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. you got troubles. i got ’em, too. there isn’t anything i wouldn’t do for you. we stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me."
27963,Penny,we did it.
27967,Penny,"well, the night is still young."
27969,Penny,"it’s just, when we were kissing, i couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl."
27977,Penny,"i thought i was okay, but it turns out i’m not."
27995,Penny,that’s true. you are.
27998,Penny,"okay, when i’m done with him, i’m gonna need more information."
28001,Penny,"no, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe i should."
28016,Penny,that sounds nice.
28018,Penny,"it’s getting kind of cheesy, leonard."
28020,Penny,okay.
28022,Penny,oh.
28025,Penny,"oh, no, no, i just, i said, whee."
28034,Penny,"you know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
28035,Penny,your glasses?
28038,Penny,"okay, well, you’re a grown woman now."
28042,Penny,"uh, no, not yet. there’s still a few people i haven’t told personally."
28045,Penny,"they started to, then her water broke. you know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart."
28049,Penny,"you’re not gonna let this go, are you?"
28055,Penny,"uh, good. is mom around?"
28067,Penny,"thanks a lot, guys."
28069,Penny,no. he was a beloved member of the family.
28084,Penny,"so, what are you thinking for dinner?"
28085,Penny,"well, honey, you don’t live with sheldon any more. you can have anything you want."
28087,Penny,"hey, we’re going to dinner. you want to come?"
28091,Penny,what else can you do? move back in with him?
28096,Penny,"okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen."
28109,Penny,"well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
28113,Penny,"well, what are you gonna do?"
28115,Penny,"all right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
28116,Penny,"oh, good for him."
28120,Penny,wow. so how many girls have you met?
28121,Penny,"well, so how does it work?"
28125,Penny,hey.
28126,Penny,"okay, here we go. now everyone can see. all right. where do we stand on cross-eyed mike?"
28129,Penny,"look, it’s stuart."
28139,Penny,yes. don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
28148,Penny,what?
28150,Penny,i know. it just…
28161,Penny,do you know what that means?
28172,Penny,no one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
28174,Penny,"yeah, come on, tell us more."
28176,Penny,"all right, where is tall british dave taking you?"
28179,Penny,"damn, you’re sneaky."
28187,Penny,"oh, there he is."
28189,Penny,"what, now you’re interested? you didn’t even want to come."
28190,Penny,fine.
28196,Penny,"oh, no."
28197,Penny,"yeah, leonard and i are gonna be cooking all day."
28199,Penny,mm-hmm.
28224,Penny,does it really say that?
28227,Penny,what are you doing?
28228,Penny,i am not putting that on the internet. i don’t want people to see this. i don’t want to see it.
28242,Penny,problem solved.
28243,Penny,"come on, sheldon. there are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems."
28247,Penny,"okay, look, i know amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
28251,Penny,"uh, sweetie, you do realize thursday is amy’s birthday."
28255,Penny,come in.
28256,Penny,we’re sorry. what do you need?
28264,Penny,"sure, sure. or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
28266,Penny,"oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow."
28275,Penny,i’m not sick. it’s for work. there’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. i’ve been trying to get in for months.
28277,Penny,"um, a psychiatrist. why?"
28282,Penny,thank you.
28304,Penny,"ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night."
28306,Penny,you really don’t know why?
28321,Penny,and now you see the problem.
28323,Penny,yeah.
28325,Penny,"ah, yeah, grandma by calvin klein. you know, the last time i got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me i parked like a blind person."
28326,Penny,i park fine.
28327,Penny,"constance, are you sure i can’t pour you some wine?"
28329,Penny,yeah.
28330,Penny,"yeah, yeah, yeah. you go ahead. i’ll catch up with you."
28338,Penny,say yes.
28342,Penny,"no, i, i really didn’t."
28344,Penny,so what did you say?
28345,Penny,"all right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?"
28350,Penny,i’m still sleeping with you tonight.
28353,Penny,"yes. oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and i just…"
28364,Penny,you’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
28365,Penny,won’t make us any younger.
28368,Penny,"oh, there’s a screening of moulin rouge, i heard the crowd sings along and stuff."
28369,Penny,midnight.
28370,Penny,"okay, great. oh, wait. uh, it’s sold out."
28376,Penny,"no, no, come on. come on, you’re not gonna get fat. you’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
28378,Penny,"yeah, i’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
28382,Penny,"okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. we can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
28384,Penny,"and whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with cheerios all over the floor."
28388,Penny,no.
28389,Penny,"no, we’re a team. if you can’t go in, we’re not going in."
28408,Penny,"thank you so much for helping us, stuart."
28409,Penny,"okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"
28413,Penny,"because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though i’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. so, what’s going on?"
28419,Penny,"okay, everybody, sheldon is gonna come back out, but i think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?"
28425,Penny,"oh, sure. let me see it."
28435,Penny,"i know, but you did it. i’m so proud of you."
28443,Penny,wow. that is a lot of whereupons.
28451,Penny,like this?
28457,Penny,"i mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? i moved here from nebraska to be an actress, and now i’m sitting in an engineering lab at caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
28471,Penny,"yeah, it’s fine."
28478,Penny,she.
28481,Penny,i’ll see if it’s available.
28484,Penny,i can see that. what team did you get?
28488,Penny,this place is great.
28500,Penny,"sheldon, what did you do?"
28513,Penny,i hate my job.
28522,Penny,what is the problem?
28526,Penny,"because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
28541,Penny,where’d you get that from?
28574,Penny,yes. pi.
28576,Penny,yes.
28578,Penny,okay.
28580,Penny,no problem.
28582,Penny,or a way for you to avoid her?
28585,Penny,okay.
28588,Penny,"wow. didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. uh, you know what, enough about leonard. let’s talk about you. what would you like to do while you’re here?"
28591,Penny,"uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say?"
28596,Penny,"you know, being in a relationship with leonard also comes with its challenges."
28602,Penny,"okay, good example."
28603,Penny,"to be honest, i’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
28604,Penny,it was spur of the moment.
28605,Penny,"thank you. so if we would have asked you to come to vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?"
28611,Penny,"uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but i think we got to a good place."
28622,Penny,no.
28631,Penny,thank you.
28632,Penny,"uh, who’s hungry? we have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
28635,Penny,"oh, maybe. get closer."
28639,Penny,"you know what, flash your lights. let him know it’s you."
28641,Penny,"so, what did we miss?"
28649,Penny,"god, i thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
28661,Penny,"all right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
28663,Penny,"okay. listen, mom, i know you’re nervous, but i promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
28664,Penny,pretty good. i actually just got assigned a much better territory.
28667,Penny,hey.
28668,Penny,hey. is everyone getting to know each other?
28672,Penny,"oh, thanks, mom."
28680,Penny,"yeah, drive safe. we love you. and give us a call… oh, my god, it was me, it was me. i’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
28685,Penny,hi.
28697,Penny,does he even like lemon bars?
28698,Penny,something happen at the meeting?
28704,Penny,"well, it just slipped out. i feel terrible."
28708,Penny,"oh, that’s what amy said. so what’s going on with the research project? are they gonna let you run it?"
28713,Penny,"oh, i’ll go. i like a party."
28716,Penny,hi.
28719,Penny,so should we talk to each other or mingle?
28722,Penny,"wait, what do you mean she’s her?"
28723,Penny,no.
28725,Penny,now sheldon’s popular? what is happening?
28737,Penny,"of course. you can stay in leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
28743,Penny,"well, where would you go?"
28744,Penny,"wait. why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
28745,Penny,"okay, it won’t be that bad. we wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
28747,Penny,mm. 
28748,Penny,"that was a cute story. so, um, what did you want to ask me?"
28752,Penny,"you’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
28755,Penny,"yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
28757,Penny,wow. i cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
28760,Penny,ugh. can we just have sex?
28764,Penny,"yeah, get it, girl."
28772,Penny,the new neighbours are weird.
28782,Penny,"all right. well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
28795,Penny,you kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘cause it’s fine.
28801,Penny,all right.
28803,Penny,"oh, now i’m with ya. okay."
28805,Penny,"well, what happened with your dad?"
28810,Penny,okay.
28811,Penny,just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed.
28812,Penny,we’re back.
28814,Penny,do you want him back?
28816,Penny,"hey, have you ever heard of the van nuys comic-con?"
28819,Penny,it doesn’t matter. i’m not doing it.
28823,Penny,"oh, yeah."
28826,Penny,who’s that?
28831,Penny,i don’t know. be cool. he’s coming. he’s coming. hi. 
28840,Penny,"yep, there they are."
28843,Penny,hello.
28849,Penny,and he started to slowly wear me down.
28850,Penny,"yeah, except the river kept showing me his pokémon cards."
28852,Penny,"you know, once, i proposed to him."
28853,Penny,"yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
28855,Penny,"yeah, i wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready."
28861,Penny,"okay, are you done? bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
28868,Penny,ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
28876,Penny,and what? your wizard robes are next to go.
28878,Penny,that’s a great idea.
28882,Penny,do you really mean that?
28883,Penny,"great, and just so you know, i’m not getting rid of all your stuff."
28884,Penny,that candle and you.
28889,Penny,"oh, that means so much. i love you."
28891,Penny,you only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
28893,Penny,all right.
28894,Penny,bam. thank you. what’s her name?
28897,Penny,"now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of legos?"
28911,Penny,there you go.
28913,Penny,what?
28915,Penny,"seriously, none of you liked it?"
28919,Penny,"oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair."
28924,Penny,but you commissioned it.
28935,Penny,"well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but i kind of feel like i’m already doing that."
28940,Penny,"okay, i’ll go to a hotel. text me in the morning if you’re still alive."
28944,Penny,"yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
28946,Penny,"oh, that was fast. did she sneeze the baby out?"
28947,Penny,"okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. bye. she said not to come. it’s gonna be a while."
28964,Penny,"hey, i bought m&ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
28965,Penny,here.
28974,Penny,"well, you’re home now."
28975,Penny,i told him to take it down. he would not listen to me.
28981,Penny,that’s too loud.
28982,Penny,hi. there’s the little family!
28988,Penny,"so tell me, how did sheldon look with an earring?"
28990,Penny,"to be fair, we may have been on edge because of the christmas tree."
28995,Penny,"yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. it’s like i’m married to an old piece of fruit."
28996,Penny,fine.
29004,Penny,you poor things you must be exhausted.
29005,Penny,so things started to turn around?
29010,Penny,"yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it."
29017,Penny,"hey, can i ask you a question? you’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
29020,Penny,hey.
29026,Penny,i don’t want to talk about it.
29028,Penny,"it’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
29029,Penny,this is exactly why i didn’t want to talk about it.
29031,Penny,"all right, we’re heading out."
29032,Penny,thanks. are you ready?
29036,Penny,"well, yeah."
29042,Penny,we’re not getting divorced.
29047,Penny,"hey, boys. how’s it going?"
29052,Penny,my dad asked if i can get him a job interview at my work.
29056,Penny,"okay. thank you, you’re the best. mm."
29057,Penny,"hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? i’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
29058,Penny,"he didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
29060,Penny,what? are you really upset about randall coming?
29061,Penny,"leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
29072,Penny,"hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
29077,Penny,i can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
29081,Penny,"you know, if you pump at the bar, i promise we’ll get free drinks."
29085,Penny,"sorry, guys. this club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? i thought we got rid of all those."
29087,Penny,maybe we should just call it a night.
29088,Penny,i’m just not really in the mood anymore.
29090,Penny,"okay, maybe i’m the one who’s sad."
29094,Penny,"i get that, okay? it’s just, leonard and i have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
29099,Penny,"aw, look at you watching sports."
29102,Penny,"you know, we could’ve come to you guys. you didn’t have to bring the baby here."
29105,Penny,that must’ve been expensive.
29106,Penny,"and if you really want to hurt him, i look great in chanel."
29109,Penny,"all right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
29120,Penny,"wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? because look."
29129,Penny,"well, you and i would get our own room, right?"
29130,Penny,"well, it’s no different than when sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
29146,Penny,"it’s not complicated. amy’s driving, that’s it."
29147,Penny,you’re the one who seems upset.
29158,Penny,you’re an even better husband.
29172,Penny,"yeah, this is a special circumstance."
29177,Penny,what? why?
29179,Penny,"well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
29198,Penny,"well, this is a moisturizing mask."
29199,Penny,"hey, i hope you don’t mind, i used a little of your eye cream last night."
29201,Penny,"ooh, yes. fun."
29207,Penny,"yeah, you’re right. you know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
29214,Penny,"hey, since when do you do laundry on a thursday?"
29225,Penny,the notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
29229,Penny,"oh, wait. i remember."
29234,Penny,"oh, is that offer for everybody?"
29239,Penny,oh.
29247,Penny,"well, congratulations."
29248,Penny,"no, on, on getting engaged, good for you."
29252,Penny,what’s the matter?
29272,Penny,‘cause he’s scared of you?
29280,Penny,"you don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
29284,Penny,"okay, thanks anyway. bye. well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. you were right, i was wrong. aren’t you gonna say anything?"
29291,Penny,good for you. 
29309,Penny,"okay, i’m good now."
29314,Penny,yeah. do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite?
29322,Penny,do you really think there’s reason to worry?
29324,Penny,the point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
29336,Penny,"okay. um, let’s try this. think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
29337,Penny,"well, then you get it."
29342,Penny,"so, you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university?"
29343,Penny,hey guys.
29353,Penny,"oh, hey guys. "

29449,Penny,"mrs. cooper, hey, it’s penny. yeah, i think i broke your son. hey, hold on. talk to your mother."

29474,Penny,nothing to see here. just sexy police business.
29477,Penny,"yeah, everybody’s happy, great."
29488,Penny,hurry.
29491,Penny,"you know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
29495,Penny,"hey, leonard. guess who’s back. dr. lorvis. yeah. you care to join us? what? you locked them in your basement?"
29503,Penny,"hey, i just heard about you and sheldon. are you okay?"

21904,Penny,"hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. oh. hi, sorry. hello!"

22156,Penny,"yeah, no, i meant plans to find some place to live. other than with me, not that i don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
22157,Penny,"look, howard, i know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. "
22159,Penny,yeah. okay. so?

22208,Penny,"seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. what’s this."
22211,Penny,"here, why don’t you put these on while i find a shirt and sport-coat to match. "
22216,Penny,"so, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
22219,Penny,"okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt."
22222,Penny,the… the eighth grade?
22223,Penny,"okay, well, i guess we’re back to the corduroy suit. "
22231,Penny,well how do you feel?
22233,Penny,wait… what? 
22234,Penny,"you should just talk to him, i’m sure you guys can work this out. "
22239,Penny,"um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s "
22243,Penny,there you go. 
22247,Penny,"oh, sorry, i’ve just, i’ve heard it before. "
22254,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. "
22266,Penny,uh-huh!
22277,Penny,"oh, it was okay i guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. "
22278,Penny,by the end. yeah. 
22281,Penny,"i have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? "
22283,Penny,"leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. you’re gonna do okay. "
22298,Penny,we have chicken tortilla and potato leek. 
22299,Penny,no.
22310,Penny,studying abroad?
22313,Penny,what does that mean?
22319,Penny,i can’t believe i’m doing this. 
22324,Penny,you deliberately stuck me with sheldon. 
22327,Penny,"i’m confused, did sheldon stop giving milk? "
22330,Penny,"you know, i’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
22347,Penny,"yeah, and the bag it came in. "
22348,Penny,"so, how do you feel? nice and loose? come to play? got your game face on?  are you ready?"
22350,Penny,sheldon. i’m just going to sit down. 
22354,Penny,"i go outside and i talk to people. alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?"
22366,Penny,"not done. by the time i finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. yeah, that’s right, i’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…"
22371,Penny,"yeah, okay, neat, but i really got to get to work, so…."
22372,Penny,"but, what about your time machine."
22379,Penny,oh. wow. good for you. 
22392,Penny,of course.
22396,Penny,"oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  "
22401,Penny,he can scrape it off. 
22403,Penny,"blah blah blah, a typical taurus. so, seriously, are we going to see you saturday?"
22406,Penny,"uh, that’s so silly."
22408,Penny,"yeah, see, that’s what kids should have. "
22409,Penny,so you’ve really never had a birthday party? 
22411,Penny,"oh my god, that’s terrible. "
22415,Penny,"okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday."
22417,Penny,"howard, here’s the difference. the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. "
22419,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw leonard a birthday party. "
22420,Penny,nevertheless we are….
22425,Penny,nice. i got him a sweater. 
22430,Penny,it’s a non-optional social convention.
22431,Penny,"okay, let’s do this, um, i will drive sheldon to get a present, and howard, you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours. "
22432,Penny,"and then raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up."
22436,Penny,"sheldon, a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn’t buy for themselves."
22437,Penny,"well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print. "
22441,Penny,"oh, okay then this one. "
22451,Penny,"sheldon, we have to go."
22456,Penny,"i’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, i’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. "
22458,Penny,"well, for one thing, we’re late for leonard’s birthday party. and for another, i told him to call security. "
22459,Penny,keep walking.
22462,Penny,happy birthday anyways. 
22467,Penny,tell me the truth. am i just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
22472,Penny,"yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the michigan state penitentiary found it. "
22473,Penny,"nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. oh god, i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. i just want to crawl into a hole and die."
22477,Penny,"really, do you think i overreacted?"
22481,Penny,"no, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. "
22486,Penny,but he had already moved on.
22487,Penny,that’s what i said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. 
22503,Penny,no.
22504,Penny,"okay, so, here’s the thing. i guess you’re aware that leonard asked me out. "
22511,Penny,"no. what i’m saying is, leonard might be different in a good way. obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. "
22514,Penny,"right, thanks."
22526,Penny,"actually, i’ve heard far too much about schrodinger’s cat. "
22527,Penny,"alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner. "
22531,Penny,right.
22534,Penny,i didn’t feel a draft. 
22537,Penny,or we could just wing it. 
22539,Penny,"sheldon, may i ask you a question? "
22543,Penny,"so, do you think that if leonard and i keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. "
22554,Penny,"oh sheldon, please, look, i’m asking you as a friend. "
22556,Penny,"oh, um, you know, i think i have the dinner shift on friday."
22557,Penny,"you know, i’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about i let you know."
22559,Penny,"sheldon, i’m working."
22561,Penny,"look, just forget i told you about me not graduating from community college. okay?"
22563,Penny,what are you talking about.
22566,Penny,"wow, i get it, because dr leonard hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree. "
22568,Penny,"so, it’s fine with you if i’m not smart. "
22571,Penny,bye guys.
22573,Penny,"yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?"
22574,Penny,"oh. oh, well, good for him. yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?"
22576,Penny,well then don’t order popcorn.
22591,Penny,"okay, where is this coming from?"
22594,Penny,"sheldon, come back, you’re losing me."
22596,Penny,i know. i heard.
22597,Penny,"oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. but, um, i think for now leonard and i are just going to stay friends."
22606,Penny,"dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
22611,Penny,"i did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here."
22619,Penny,oic.
22630,Penny,"alright, alright, how do i get the sword?"
22632,Penny,"thank you, i really appreciate this."
22636,Penny,yeah. leonard gave me an emergency key.
22640,Penny,"okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the black castle?"
22645,Penny,i don’t work on mondays.
22646,Penny,"uh, queen penelope afk. what?"
22652,Penny,"oh, here come the mummies, which spell do i use? the hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?"
22653,Penny,"i dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies."
22662,Penny,"whatever, i’ll figure it out myself."
22665,Penny,"creepy, howard."
22667,Penny,what do you have….
22689,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and i’m going to leave so, namaste.  and fyi, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
22691,Penny,thanks for the update

22769,Penny,"all right. look, i didn’t know, i’m sorry."
22779,Penny,i don’t care. i’m taking a stand. metaphorically.
22782,Penny,"yeah, you do that."
22785,Penny,"well, you have three strikes. one, coming in. two, sitting down. and three, i don’t like your attitude."
22791,Penny,"look, i like hanging out with you guys, but i’m not going to apologize for something i didn’t do."
22792,Penny,"that’s strike one, leonard."
22796,Penny,"no, just try."
22797,Penny,well?
22803,Penny,"oh, no, are all the machines taken? what are you gonna do?"

22892,Penny,oh hey.
22900,Penny,just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
22905,Penny,your pants are ruined.
22906,Penny,"so, how did the talk with stephanie go?"
22916,Penny,"yeah, that’ll slow it down."

22934,Penny,"so, are you and leonard working on an experiment together?"
22936,Penny,"since always. call me a geek, but i am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
22951,Penny,that’s what you took from that? the guy is married!
22952,Penny,"and you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?"
22957,Penny,merry christmas.
22962,Penny,"well, yeah, yeah, i guess. but look, he signed it."
22964,Penny,here. open it.
22968,Penny,"leonard, look! sheldon’s hugging me."
22974,Penny,"you know, since i moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded."
22978,Penny,"look, normally i can just ignore you. i mean, i get it, you’re a little peculiar. you know, like sheldon."
22983,Penny,hey.
22989,Penny,"oh, please, how could i possibly devastate howard?"
22992,Penny,"and say what? that i didn’t mean it, because i meant it."
23001,Penny,"okay. well, bye. "
23003,Penny,"oh, it’s cute."
23008,Penny,"look, i’m telling you, i’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time i feel like i’m talking to a real person. and you know what? i like him, he’s a nice guy."
23019,Penny,and you moved in anyway?
23032,Penny,eww.
23040,Penny,"yes, it occurs to me, too."
23043,Penny,"no, i can’t."
23050,Penny,i’m regretting this already.
23053,Penny,yes.
23057,Penny,"thank you, leonard. what’s my share?"
23063,Penny,"here, leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
23067,Penny,she needed money. you seem under pressure. did i not lend you a sufficient amount? because i can give you more.
23068,Penny,"oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? yeah. you would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills."
23071,Penny,"yeah. when i didn’t pay my bill, the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience."
23083,Penny,he was drunk.
23086,Penny,"leonard, i’m not gonna call up kurt and ask him for money."
23097,Penny,"well, i cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."
23099,Penny,"nope. i just think he’s really changed. we’re having dinner tomorrow night, and i get to wear my new beret. bye, guys."
23103,Penny,it’s out of order.
23104,Penny,i think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
23106,Penny,"uh, i’m penny. i’m his neighbour."
23112,Penny,"oh, um, okay, like, five or six. five."
23116,Penny,"yeah, i don’t know what that means."
23119,Penny,"uh-huh, he called me slugger until i got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. i wasn’t slugger anymore. your mother’s here!"
23123,Penny,"oh, my god. what happened?"
23141,Penny,get out!
23145,Penny,the whole thing froze. i don’t know what happened.
23150,Penny,what?
23155,Penny,"oh, no, thanks. i’m from nebraska. when we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. "
23157,Penny,"oh, what are we gonna do?"
23165,Penny,here we go.
23176,Penny,thanks for the shoes.
23182,Penny,of course i haven’t.
23200,Penny,"okay, i found the box. now what?"
23201,Penny,"hang on. sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?"
23202,Penny,not yet. there it is.
23215,Penny,nancy. her name is nancy.
23216,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? i just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
23222,Penny,"well, i don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff."
23227,Penny,yes.
23234,Penny,a day?
23246,Penny,"wait, wait, what am i going to do?"
23248,Penny,"uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. i mean, it kind of looks like the myspace page of a 13-year-old girl."
23253,Penny,"wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth?"
23254,Penny,get out! who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
23263,Penny,"honey, do you want some coffee?"
23270,Penny,oh. then never mind.
23273,Penny,"okay, well. guess we’d better get started."
23275,Penny,"yes, yes, i know that, okay? i’m tired, i’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. the point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. who’s with me?"
23278,Penny,"okay, it’s done. look, guys, for the future, i don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
23279,Penny,"not with a thousand condoms, howard."
23285,Penny,"well, i’m sure the new people will be just as quiet."
23295,Penny,okay.
23300,Penny,"oh, they’re all up there, huh? hmm, typical."
23313,Penny,"i don’t even know why i care. i don’t care. all right, i cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all i care."
23314,Penny,"what are you saying, that i’m threatened by alicia? that i’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?"
23315,Penny,bees. aaah! i just got that physicist joke.
23316,Penny,"no, no occasion, just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps."
23318,Penny,yes.
23327,Penny,"apples and oranges here, sheldon. i’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. it creams my corn."
23331,Penny,"um, i don’t know, i don’t think a lot."
23337,Penny,excuse me?
23346,Penny,spider-man. get him spider-man.
23354,Penny,"no, no, no, i just meant for… yeah."
23355,Penny,what about the guy over there in the superhero t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
23358,Penny,"oh, hellblazer. what’s this about?"
23369,Penny,"oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. come on, i think i have decaf."
23378,Penny,"yum. well, enjoy your big evening."
23386,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, i was making coffee and i ran out of milk."
23396,Penny,why are you asking?
23405,Penny,"oh, alright. i will give you my bed on one condition. that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."
23406,Penny,only if it doesn’t rhyme.
23408,Penny,maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
23409,Penny,your home is twenty feet from here.
23415,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
23416,Penny,yeah.
23423,Penny,"well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘cause you know, you and me…"
23424,Penny,"okay, well, that’s really cool of you."
23425,Penny,"well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?"
23437,Penny, sheldon.
23441,Penny, sheldon.
23443,Penny,what do you want?
23444,Penny,"now, honey, i already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."
23448,Penny,excuse me.
23450,Penny,sheldon says you’re going to the north pole.
23451,Penny,yeah. i’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
23459,Penny,"oh, leonard, what time is it?"
23464,Penny,"leonard, i don’t know what to tell you. it was just a hug."
23482,Penny,oh. sorry. i don’t know your sad song.
23487,Penny,hi.
23490,Penny,"oh, my god. that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that i didn’t understand."
23501,Penny,leonard?
23513,Penny,"don’t talk, just drink."
23517,Penny,schnapps.
23520,Penny,what do you have a safe deposit box for?
23522,Penny,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i’m not feeling so hot either."
23523,Penny,"i don’t know, empathy? anyway, i’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with howard, and i’m upset about something with leonard."
23527,Penny,"no, i mean, we can always go back to being friends."
23533,Penny,come here. 
23534,Penny,"morning, sheldon. come dance with me."
23540,Penny,"oh, you’re my little homunculus."
23543,Penny,"you know what, i give up. he’s impossible."
23547,Penny,"fine, whatever. are you finished?"
23548,Penny,"um, yeah, sure, thanks."
23551,Penny,"uh, yeah, i think we’ll pass."
23559,Penny,of course.
23560,Penny,"mmm, these are so good"
23563,Penny,"yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."
23572,Penny,"hard to believe, but go on."
23581,Penny,"oh, kill me."
23584,Penny,that’s great.
23585,Penny,are we terrible people?
23597,Penny,"you mean, like a pinky swear?"
23602,Penny,and you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
23606,Penny,"she’s adorable, howard. i think you’ll like her."
23607,Penny,"no, i thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
23608,Penny,"i just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…"
23611,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s your fault."
23615,Penny,kite fighting?
23618,Penny,"well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone."
23623,Penny,"oh, my god, no. why would you ask that?"
23626,Penny,"leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. i just, you know, i didn’t want you to be bored."
23633,Penny,"sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
23642,Penny,until half time.
23645,Penny,"so, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. he is really smart."
23647,Penny,"all right, five. one, two, three, four, five. oh, wow, look at that, my department of defence research grant is renewed."
23648,Penny,yay.
23650,Penny,"um, yeah, if you want. i mean, there may not be room. he’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
23662,Penny,"oh, you are such a…  what the hell is he doing?"
23672,Penny,"well, that’s not gonna happen."
23679,Penny,great.
23684,Penny,"well, i’m sorry, sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
23695,Penny,"oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
23696,Penny,"no, i’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
23714,Penny,come in! hurry!
23716,Penny,"oh, for god’s sakes, i’m in the bathroom!"
23722,Penny,what?
23723,Penny,uh-huh.
23727,Penny,ow.
23728,Penny,"no, no, no, i can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."
23740,Penny,is that my arm?
23743,Penny,good.
23744,Penny,"all right, can we please go?"
23752,Penny,what?
23766,Penny,thanks. that’s much better.
23769,Penny,sing “soft kitty” to me.
23770,Penny,injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
23772,Penny,why are you back from your date so early?
23778,Penny,different how?
23781,Penny,"hey, i did not settle for leonard. i mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with, you know, physically."
23786,Penny,"yes, but i don’t think she wants to see you."
23787,Penny,"come on, howard. you hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. plus, i’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya."
23790,Penny,mm-hmm.
23791,Penny,you want me to throw him out?
23792,Penny,"are you sure? he’s small. i bet i can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
23796,Penny,"oh, come on, it’s fine. we’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
23807,Penny,"um, actually, can we do it in private?"
23823,Penny,ancient greece?
23834,Penny,not that far back!
23835,Penny,i don’t know. where were we looking up at the night sky?
23837,Penny,squared?
23843,Penny,"really? that’s it? well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
23847,Penny,"actually, that’s not true, leonard. in fact, recently i’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands. their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the aharonov-bohm quantum-interference effect. that’s it. that’s all i know. oh, wait! fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts, not the scientist."
23850,Penny,i just love decorating the christmas tree. it makes me feel like a little girl again.
23879,Penny,"okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
23882,Penny,"well, we are known for our cheesecake. hit us again."
23903,Penny,"she’s not one of those phonies, okay. she wrote a book and has her own web site."
23913,Penny,thank you. would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
23918,Penny,and astrology.
23924,Penny,"good night. that was weird, even for him."
23936,Penny,"ugh, what can you do? here. "
23939,Penny,is he quitting his job at the university?
23943,Penny,whatcha doing?
23946,Penny,and you’re stuck?
23953,Penny,"oh, what a gentleman. hey, sheldon. "
23959,Penny,"well, it creeps me out."
23960,Penny,just answer the phone.
23966,Penny,"okay, i’ll get those drinks started for you."
23968,Penny,"no, wait, wait, no, wait. wh.. what are you doing here?"
23973,Penny,sheldon doesn’t work here.
23978,Penny,we’re going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn?
23995,Penny,i’ll talk to leonard.
24001,Penny,oh!
24011,Penny,"yeah, well, i’m sick, too."
24015,Penny,"um, can you give me a hint?"
24018,Penny,of course i do. you’re an important part of my life and i pay attention to the things you are interested in.
24025,Penny,"no, it isn’t."
24029,Penny,"yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
24035,Penny,"the reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that i had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts i’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
24042,Penny,"i’m going to write you a cheque for that. as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
24043,Penny,"okay, i realize that…"
24047,Penny,what’s going on?
24049,Penny,"oh, nice."
24050,Penny,"oh, okay. well, i was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
24053,Penny,really? great!
24063,Penny,are you stan lee?
24069,Penny,why not?
24095,Penny,"oh. i say a lot of things, sweetie. so, how about it, sheldon?"
24104,Penny,it’s ridiculous.
24105,Penny,please just try this one on.
24108,Penny,"fine, faint."
24120,Penny,hi.
24122,Penny,"no, no, it’s okay. i mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me."
24132,Penny,"okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
24148,Penny,"really? so, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause i said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
24151,Penny,"so, we’re good?"
24156,Penny,"thank you, stuart. it’s nice to know."
24158,Penny,yeah.
24161,Penny,"oh, yeah, me, too."
24177,Penny,"okay, here’s the protocol, you and i are still friends, and you stop saying coitus."
24183,Penny,"you’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?"
24187,Penny,interesting. i’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
24190,Penny,"so, um, was leonard okay with you coming over?"
24193,Penny,"oh, god, i feel terrible."
24197,Penny,have you been running?
24202,Penny,"yeah, i guess you’re right."
24207,Penny,"okay, you can take him for shoes."
24212,Penny,"okay, whatever."
24216,Penny,how was i supposed to know that?
24223,Penny,sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
24230,Penny,"what? what are you doing with, what?"
24232,Penny,oh. what?
24238,Penny,"no, mr. smarty-pants. i ignored the fill gas tank light."
24239,Penny,hello.
24240,Penny,"oh, penny, this is dr. plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. dr. plimpton, penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
24249,Penny,"oh, no, no, it’s okay. you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
24251,Penny,i found these in the dryer. i’m assuming they belong to sheldon.
24253,Penny,"well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
24256,Penny,i’m listening.
24258,Penny,hang on.
24263,Penny,so sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
24271,Penny,what does that have to do with joyce kim?
24275,Penny,"okay, how do you know he said that? you left the room."
24276,Penny,fine. go ahead. 
24280,Penny,"okay, so, basically, you’re the reason i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
24288,Penny,"oh, right."
24294,Penny,"damn you, you rat bastard."
24299,Penny,"you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. now, come with me."
24301,Penny,"put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud."
24308,Penny,"oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
24312,Penny,"look, i said i’m sorry. can’t u please let it go?"
24313,Penny,"oh. hey, leonard."
24315,Penny,are you out of your mind?!
24316,Penny,"ah, cool."
24318,Penny,all right. pass the soy sauce.
24321,Penny,"oh ha-ha, oh. that’s amazing."
24329,Penny,"oh, my god! sheldon and amy."
24330,Penny,"okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
24337,Penny,why not?
24344,Penny,what?
24345,Penny,"well, go ask leonard."
24350,Penny,"well, no, not per se, but…"
24358,Penny,"my point is, i know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
24373,Penny,"so, um, amy, what about you? do you date much?"
24381,Penny,"okay, sheldon, you are so wrong. that is not even close to the real number. i’m gonna need a drink over here."
24385,Penny,you’re still on that?
24402,Penny,"wait. honey,have you ever run before?"
24404,Penny,"oh, my god, that is so creepy!"

24436,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
24442,Penny,get one yourself.
24444,Penny,i thought you were going to talk to sheldon.
24453,Penny,i hear you broke up with amy.
24457,Penny,okay. good.
24459,Penny,"well, i’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but i know sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on tuesdays. and even if raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. and leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
24461,Penny,yeah.
24463,Penny,not since i found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
24465,Penny,"yeah, sure. just yesterday, she asked, why is howard hiding under the table?"
24472,Penny,"oh, you’re right. that is so embarrassing."
24473,Penny,bernadette or the troll?
24477,Penny,"okay, i will think about it."
24478,Penny,"yeah, i said i’d think about it."
24486,Penny,"it’s passion fruit, new on the menu."
24492,Penny,sheldon?
24497,Penny,"i’m sorry, honey, i don’t know millilitres."
24499,Penny,a what?
24522,Penny,"you know amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts."
24528,Penny,not even when you were a kid?
24529,Penny,"okay. well, i guess we’re having a slumber party. oh!"
24538,Penny,"okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. i mean, leonard’s a great guy."
24550,Penny,"get over yourself. i whistled, you came running."
24551,Penny,"okay, why are you arguing about this?"
24559,Penny,"yeah, that’s great. it’s a funny story. moving on."
24564,Penny,good night.
24566,Penny,shut up. you know what i’ve been doing for the last hour?
24572,Penny,maybe.
24574,Penny,"okay, sheldon, you don’t have to do this because leonard and i are not…"
30722,Raj,"hey, leonard, will you please tell howard my sister’s never been attracted to him."
30724,Raj,on caprica night?
32774,Raj,i know.
32775,Raj,"okay. if i make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
32776,Raj,yes.
30729,Raj,how hard did she stomp?
32778,Raj,what kind of scientist are you? everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
30738,Raj,"oh, yeah? what’s that look like?"
32787,Raj,that is so offensive. does everything you know about hinduism come from indiana jones?
30739,Raj,where are we going?
32790,Raj,"you see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? it’s called a sikhara. it symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
30744,Raj,"oh, bella, don’t you see? edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you.  coming."
32794,Raj,"sorry. you’re right. i’m so stressed. but you know what, whenever i walk into that temple i realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. we’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us."
32795,Raj,"whether you call it god or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. s, seriously? you were just gonna drive away? like my life isn’t hard enough right now. a space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs."
32801,Raj,"all right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
30754,Raj,"ah, me, too."
32803,Raj,and you think that’s going to help?
30755,Raj,"i think he’s eating lunch. uh, sheldon, i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson from the hayden planetarium in new york."
32806,Raj,"thank you. ‘cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
30760,Raj,i haven’t cried like this since toy story 3.
30763,Raj,"you know, guys, when facing disappointment, eat, pray, love teaches us–"
32812,Raj,did he respond yet?
32819,Raj,i’m so sick of people being mean on the internet.
30773,Raj,is that racist? it feels racist.
32823,Raj,"yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
32824,Raj,"smart, looks like we’re being helpful."
32825,Raj,"dude, i, i think that’s nathan fillion."
32833,Raj,thanks.
32834,Raj,"are you sure you’re not him? uh, you can tell us. we’re scientists, not crazy fanboys."
32835,Raj,"and you’re eating alone at a deli. i don’t buy it, you’re not him."
30786,Raj,yeah. like his haircut material.
30793,Raj,"no, you wouldn’t. you’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. my only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people i hired to be my living chess set."
32845,Raj,"yeah. mrs. wolowitz was pretty special. when i first moved to america, howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought i was the gardener."
32851,Raj,"well, even if the study’s nonsense, i don’t believe in tempting fate. same reason i wouldn’t use a ouija board, or pick a fight with an asian guy. he probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?"
32854,Raj,"ooh, uh, emily gets off work soon. why don’t the four of us go out?"
32857,Raj,"so, what do you guys want to do?"
32859,Raj,"uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?"
32860,Raj,"ooh. okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
32862,Raj,"uh, origin of species."
32864,Raj,"it’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
32865,Raj,"so, where’s your roommate tonight?"
32866,Raj,"but remember our agreement? you can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
30816,Raj,"oh, hey."
30818,Raj,"well, type two diabetes runs in my family. the thought of losing a toe…"
30821,Raj,no. but it’s a stupid test.
32873,Raj,i can’t get emily’s night-stand to close.
32884,Raj,you’re not helping.
32887,Raj,how was the hospital?
30842,Raj,first day of cricket camp. they drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
30845,Raj,no.
32895,Raj,no. just the drawer.
30854,Raj,"oh, man. scooter sucks. he’s the aquaman of the muppet babies."
32905,Raj,you got it.
30860,Raj,i think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
32915,Raj,"dude, three-time sanskriti school for well-born boys badminton champion."
32916,Raj,what?
32917,Raj,"we are. we are. oh, no. what a terrible serve. sorry, brother."
30873,Raj,"well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? you know, get the word of mouth going."
32922,Raj,"what, and that’s not offensive? where’s the line?"
30874,Raj,"i’ll tell you one thing. if i get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl i want to take on a submarine ride. and yes, that time, i meant it to be dirty."
32925,Raj,the guy who invented it says it’s jif.
30877,Raj,okay. come on in.
30880,Raj,what did i do?
32929,Raj,"hmm. what if he’s in prison? what if he’s a spy? what if he’s in a beatles cover band? i’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer ringo."
30882,Raj,i’d like to weigh in here. no.
30883,Raj,"ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their flickr account."
32932,Raj,enough chitchat. how do we know you are who you say you are?
32934,Raj,"a kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
32935,Raj,you’re in a beatles cover band and you need howard to replace your dad as ringo.
32940,Raj,"but technically, yes."
32941,Raj,hey.
30893,Raj,just that i’m definitely not gay.
32945,Raj,and i was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
30897,Raj,"it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.  it’s howard. howard, hello."
30904,Raj,"oh, right. good one."
30905,Raj,"here’s what i wonder about zombies.  what happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? they can’t starve to death, they’re already dead."
30906,Raj,"yeah, okay, so, zombies."
30908,Raj,or maybe he heard it’s tator tot tuesday. that’s why i’m here.
32958,Raj,"eh. although, to be fair, i watched e.t. build a telephone out of a speak & spell and an umbrella. dude was like a little brown macgyver."
32961,Raj,and gertie can’t stop crying.
32962,Raj,"okay, let’s talk about something else."
30916,Raj,do him first.
32967,Raj,"ooh. ooh, ooh. we could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
30920,Raj,you can’t come in.
30922,Raj,you heard me. i forbidded it.
30924,Raj,"clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, mike."
30928,Raj,"yeah, but you were just sleeping, because i forboded you to have sex."
30930,Raj,"there it is, priya. we’re indian. we believe this stuff."
30931,Raj,"some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. my point is, you can’t go out with leonard."
32980,Raj,"well, i think we should show what earthlings look like."
30933,Raj,"penny, you became disenchanted with leonard as a lover. would you please tell my sister why?"
30936,Raj,all the more shame that will fall upon the house of hofstadter.
32988,Raj,"look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. ooh, do you own a t-shirt cannon?"
32989,Raj,i don’t know. why do i own one?
32992,Raj,"if you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask."
30950,Raj,"yes, it is. very cool!"
30952,Raj,these cards have barcodes on them. the wand is a reader. it’s transmitting to your phone.
30959,Raj,"hold on. i’m talking to an orc under the bridge in thunder bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things."
33011,Raj,not cool.
30965,Raj,"good, because i would hate that."
30966,Raj,"oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. i’m not going to be your go-between."
33022,Raj,how old is this jell-o?
33023,Raj,"yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
30975,Raj,very nice. you lie to my sister.
33029,Raj,"no, no, no. hey, you should totally get it. in fact, i’ll buy it for you."
33033,Raj,what difference does it make?
33039,Raj,"oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and elizabeth mcnulty, who apparently died when she was the same age i am."
33042,Raj,i think we should talk.
30994,Raj,are you listening to this guy?
30995,Raj,so what’s up?
30996,Raj,"oh, no. i hope everything’s okay."
30997,Raj,yeah. good or devastating.
33047,Raj,didn’t even crack the top ten.
33048,Raj,i’m sure you guys will figure something out.
33050,Raj,"yeah. come on, i’ll give you a ride."
31003,Raj,no. it’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. like when the three of us went to the movies and you and i waited outside the bathroom while howard threw up red vines and cherry coke. do you remember that?
33055,Raj,hang on. what do i need to do to make you trust me?
31007,Raj,my sister told me.
31009,Raj,what can i do? i can’t stop thinking about her.
31012,Raj,wow. i can’t believe old smelly pooper finally got laid.
31014,Raj,this is it.
31015,Raj,you will?
31018,Raj,i have to feel sorry for myself. i’m the only one who cares. just like i’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
31024,Raj,what?
31026,Raj,what are you doing?
31027,Raj,"oh, cool. can i play?"
31029,Raj,"no, thank you. i’m fine."
33078,Raj,are you turning it the right way?
33079,Raj,"here, let me try. you’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way."
33081,Raj,there’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
31036,Raj,"i’m a scientist. my ability to think is my bread and butter. i’m afraid if i take this, i might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
31038,Raj,"okay, let’s see if this drug works."
31040,Raj,india.
33090,Raj,"hey, we’ve always talked about playing together."
33092,Raj,"it’s been around for years. it’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
33093,Raj,"dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name."
33095,Raj,what is it?
33096,Raj,i just got chills.
33097,Raj,"so i have an idea for a filk song. it’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
31048,Raj,"ooh, fire demon. sheldon’s turning up the heat."
33100,Raj,"that is, that is so good!"
33102,Raj,"hey, remember the ark of the covenant?"
31060,Raj,like what?
33109,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it."
33111,Raj,i still love it. i just think there’s room for improvement.
33113,Raj,"no, no. i’m just evolving as a musician. you’re the one who’s stuck in the past."
31067,Raj,what if she wasn’t kidding?
33120,Raj,"thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
33126,Raj,"ooh, ooh, i forgot about princess bride. that’s my answer."
31082,Raj,you’re kidding.
31083,Raj,i was sleeping.
33132,Raj,"whoa, whoa. walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work."
31093,Raj,what the hell is this?
31094,Raj,this says you can make end of life decisions for me.
33143,Raj,i have that same underwear.
31096,Raj,"well, that seems fair."
33146,Raj,"hmm. i’m doing okay, and i was very popular at 13."
33147,Raj,"oh, no. at home. the servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. i wish i knew their names."
33149,Raj,"so, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
33152,Raj,you sure? it’s a pretty great wall.
31104,Raj,"well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
33154,Raj,that is so generous of you. i’d like to switch sides.
33155,Raj,"well, it’s easy to find out. just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
31106,Raj,it’s my sister. can we not talk about this any more?
31107,Raj,yeah.
33158,Raj,so what’s up?
33159,Raj,you’re not wrong about fruit stripe. i was always a hubba bubba man.
31109,Raj,"what’s wrong with me, penny?"
31110,Raj,"hey, you totally got that right! e equals m c squared."
31112,Raj,hey.
33165,Raj,"oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner sheldon’s contact information."
33166,Raj,i’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
33172,Raj,sixty seconds. this is not looking good.
31128,Raj,"aw, there’s a thing."
33178,Raj,answer it.
31133,Raj,"of course. i’m always packing. anyway, um, i had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
33182,Raj,nice try. it only recognizes my voice.
31135,Raj,"penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
31139,Raj,"okay, just the candle thing."
31145,Raj,"sure, whatever."
31149,Raj,"oh, yeah. this is one good-looking panini."
31152,Raj,i’ll try it. like this?
31154,Raj,better?
33207,Raj,"hey, dude, trent just checked in at the coffee shop on fair oaks."
33209,Raj,"from there, it was easy to find him on instagram, snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
31161,Raj,maybe. why not? who do i have in my life to watch my figure for?
33214,Raj,"it’s okay. oh, it’s okay. he’s done."
31169,Raj,"okay, i’m going to play it cool. tell her, maybe. whatever, babe."
33219,Raj,"guys, they’re gonna sell out."
33221,Raj,i don’t know. have you ever seen a movie with stuart before?
31173,Raj,"tell her it doesn’t matter. tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
31176,Raj,you’re blowing this for me!
33229,Raj,and we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
33230,Raj,it is.
31181,Raj,"let’s see, what else can i tell you about me that would make you like me? ooh, i love music. do you love music?"
31182,Raj,you’re right. everyone loves music.
33236,Raj,oh. what if leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
33237,Raj,low self-esteem.
31192,Raj,"whatever, dude. she kissed me."
33241,Raj,still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
31193,Raj,"oh, fine. let’s agree she kissed both of us."
31194,Raj,i’m so mad at you!
31196,Raj,i’m hammered.
33252,Raj,a medium-sized asteroid.
31205,Raj,"well, i choose love."
33255,Raj,you dream different than me.
31210,Raj,"look, penny, you’re great, but i had a long talk with my parents, and they said if i date an indian girl, i get a maserati."
33259,Raj,"yeah, s-so it’s, like, kooper with a k?"
31211,Raj,"mmm. oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though i can’t have sex with you."
31216,Raj,"hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the borg queen in first contact?"
31222,Raj,i’m so lonely.
33272,Raj,"oh, ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
31225,Raj,he’s probably right.
33274,Raj,of course i do.
31226,Raj,i had pee his pants.
31227,Raj,what is she doing in a comic book store?
31228,Raj,you have a thing of paper clips right there.
33278,Raj,"fine, how about this? you’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and i wish you’d stop."
33279,Raj,"no, come on, please don’t leave."
31236,Raj,"come on, sheldon, star wars."
31237,Raj,i really don’t get your problem with birds.
31238,Raj,hummingbirds are pretty.
33290,Raj,"i’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
31245,Raj,"stuart, settle an argument for us. who would win, billy the kid or the white wizard?"
31247,Raj,wild bill witchcock.
33296,Raj,"yeah, i get that. i’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
33297,Raj,"well, astrophysicist."
31252,Raj,"hey, guys, check it out. the deluxe limited edition wild west and witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
33304,Raj,i do. i just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
33308,Raj,"all right. i’ve made up my mind. i’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that i’m in a relationship."
33311,Raj,"actually, that’s why i’m calling. i, um, i just, i need to let you know that i have a girlfriend."
33314,Raj,"come on, i just told you i had a girlfriend. the least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
33316,Raj,"right. good catch. anyway, so i’m sorry to waste your time. and, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
33319,Raj,"bye. all right. so, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. everybody’s happy. easy peasy."
33324,Raj,i will.
33325,Raj,hey.
33326,Raj,spending valentine’s day with emily.
31278,Raj,i guess it didn’t go well.
31279,Raj,you were in the middle of an erection.
33333,Raj,"you’re right, let’s talk again in a few days."
33337,Raj,"yes. whenever things are going well, i always find a way to ruin it. you two look happy, how do you do it?"
33338,Raj,"no, sheldon’s right. emily did say i always talk about my feelings too much."
31289,Raj,what are you doing right now?
31294,Raj,i’d like you to call me sexy.
33346,Raj,"if it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in december, congratulations, you’re the first one."
31299,Raj,it’s just a phone.
33352,Raj,"yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
31305,Raj,"oh, my god, kenny g? this woman can read me like a book. i can’t believe i bought my soul mate at glendale galleria."
31307,Raj,"um, expedition 31 will launch this spring to the international space station. crew members will include commander tom ‘tombo’ johnson, astronaut mike ‘supernova’ novacelik and payload specialist howard wolowitz."
33356,Raj,i hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
31308,Raj,"dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
33364,Raj,he’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. maybe we could get him a fossil.
31319,Raj,"okay, um, how about crash”? howard “crash” wolowitz."
31322,Raj,"okay, uh, what if we make rocket man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, i’ll call you and they’ll hear it. plant the seed."
31326,Raj,gamma.
33377,Raj,"you know, on game of thrones, balon greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box."
31329,Raj,"you know, if i had a week off, i’d go back to the two bunch palms resort and spa in the desert. i tell you, an hour on the massage table with trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
31335,Raj,follow your heart.
31336,Raj,like what?
31342,Raj,"ooh, limited edition. nice."
31343,Raj,how about you decide this with rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock?
31346,Raj,"i’m happy for you, sheldon. but i have to admit i’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
33395,Raj,will do.
33397,Raj,"i don’t know. i lost track and i missed my exit. so, uh, so what’s up?"
31349,Raj,"what, you don’t like wind chimes?"
33400,Raj,"right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, i’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. but it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything."
31353,Raj,it doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
33404,Raj,"no, no. please don’t cry."
33406,Raj,i don’t think so. she sounded pretty upset.
33408,Raj,"i think we both know if i come over, we’re gonna get back together and…"
33415,Raj,"well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. you need any help?"
33418,Raj,leonard and howard don’t have a flat. they went to the movies. look.
31371,Raj,i’ll let you know.
31372,Raj,"alright, uh, fine, i’m coming and i’m bringing somebody. uh, koothrappali plus one."
31376,Raj,"listen, uh, there’s something i want to talk to you about. i, i wasn’t ready until now, but i think it’s time."
31377,Raj,"no, i’m not gay. if anything, i’m metrosexual."
33427,Raj,no spoilers. no spoilers.
31380,Raj,yes.
33432,Raj,i don’t understand.
31387,Raj,and this is howard.
33436,Raj,"i appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. i overstepped my bounds."
31388,Raj,please have a seat.  i’m thinking double wedding!
31389,Raj,"well, i hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
31394,Raj,say again.
33448,Raj,"no, i’m actually dating two women. later."
33449,Raj,"man, i’m worn out."
31400,Raj,w-w-with women. i like to boogie with women.
33453,Raj,"hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?"
33455,Raj,"oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. can’t even remember what that’s like."
33459,Raj,i never said that.
33463,Raj,"okay, i think i see what’s happening here. you’re jealous of me."
33466,Raj,"okay, then you go there."
33468,Raj,"says i was talking too much about dating claire and emily, and i accused him of being jealous."
31421,Raj,"that’s incredible. oh, here, break out the math."
33482,Raj,"hi, yeah. um, i was wondering, if you’re free saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
31438,Raj,"may i have your attention, please? we are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend howard wolowitz."
31449,Raj,"seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. anything under ten miles an hour and i can combat-roll into the street."
31450,Raj,"thank you, bernadette."
33499,Raj,"yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great claire is."
31453,Raj,all right. more sailor moon for me.
31456,Raj,you weren’t?
33505,Raj,"uh, i’d say by three."
31459,Raj,"from that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. shh, no one can know."
33509,Raj,you can’t make me feel bad.
33512,Raj,you’re right. you realize what this means?
31464,Raj,"oh, thanks, man."
33514,Raj,open it.
33515,Raj,is there a window around here we don’t know about?
31469,Raj,i believe you two have prepared vows?
31473,Raj,peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
33524,Raj,"what about the guy on the channel four news? you know, four on your side? maybe he can be on your side."
31476,Raj,"hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, i heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. i don’t need to tell you in los angeles, sandal season is year round."
31480,Raj,yoo-hoo! over here!
33530,Raj,hello.

33534,Raj,may i ask what this is about?
31488,Raj,"i was, but it’s their anniversary and i didn’t want to be a third wheel, so i figured i’d come over here and hang out with you and penny on your date."
33538,Raj,what are you talking about? they’ve always known where you live.
33542,Raj,that’s what he said to me.
33543,Raj,"calm down, okay? try not to think about it."
31494,Raj,what? why?
31499,Raj,"oh, penny. that’s ridiculous. you know you love him. you, you look him in the eyes and you say it. "
31513,Raj,i should go.
33562,Raj,"wow. you’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. now i know how all those army wives feel."
31515,Raj,"hey, stuart."
33564,Raj,he is so afraid of his feelings.
33565,Raj,"well, i didn’t get to see you last night. it was the least i could do."
33566,Raj,"so, what should we do today?"
33567,Raj,"well, i don’t mind. oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
33568,Raj,"oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
31516,Raj,"do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?"
31519,Raj,"bye, buddy!"
31523,Raj,"so, what are you guys doing later? stuart and i were thinking of going out for a drink."
33572,Raj,"you didn’t think i was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here i am."
31524,Raj,‘cause that’s what we do.
33575,Raj,"oh, that’s a nice one. was it yours when you were little?"
33578,Raj,"yeah, that’s not worrisome at all."
31530,Raj,i’m in her head. let the dance begin.
33580,Raj,"i think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. so, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
31534,Raj,"okay, the nasa web site says howard’s final descent has begun."
33583,Raj,"well, not now."
31536,Raj,"oh, uh, come in, come in. oh, i, uh, i didn’t think i was going to get to see you until tomorrow."
31537,Raj,"wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"
31541,Raj,"it’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes."
31542,Raj,which part?
31547,Raj,would you like me to help? i do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
31548,Raj,"you know, you don’t worry about money. i’ll take care of everything."
31549,Raj,"yeah, you’ll love it. ain’t no party like a koothra-party."
33600,Raj,"the polite response is, thank you for noticing."
33601,Raj,"if you want, you can find out right now."
33602,Raj,"well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
33605,Raj,"what? this is not a problem, okay? if you don’t want to know, i don’t have to tell you."
33606,Raj,"okay, well, that’s a problem."
31558,Raj,what’s wrong with you?
31559,Raj,"oh, howard, i’ve got a party to plan. don’t make me pull it out of you."
33612,Raj,"i don’t know. if i want to watch old people sweat, i can just facetime my family in india."
31565,Raj,"try to keep up, howard, i’m killing it."
33614,Raj,maybe howard and bernadette said i could be here.
33616,Raj,here you go.
31568,Raj,i’m not finishing your sentence. you pulled the plug on my funk.
31570,Raj,"because when i use my regular voice, i feel like i’m making fun of them."
31571,Raj,"dude, my accent is brilliant.  hey, my snow-white american friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese."
29525,Raj,why?
29527,Raj,are there any chopsticks?
31577,Raj,it’ll be okay.
29531,Raj,"intoxicating, isn’t it?"
29534,Raj,i’ve got him leonard. tonight i spice my meat with goblin blood!
29535,Raj,"oooh, he’s got me."
33631,Raj,wait till you see the crib we found.
33632,Raj,"yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. i wouldn’t even call it a crib, i’d call it a fortress of solitude for babies."
33634,Raj,"though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
29539,Raj,you might be bound by them right now.
29541,Raj,you could power down.
29544,Raj,why don’t you just have robert e. lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh.
31592,Raj,"boy, what i wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."
33647,Raj,"i’m not really a part of this, so i’m just gonna dig in."
33648,Raj,"now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
33650,Raj,"we can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
33653,Raj,"oh, no, it’s okay. i just found a wobble."
29557,Raj,what is your move?
29559,Raj,"oh, that’s very impressive. and a little racist. "
31607,Raj,"sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."
29561,Raj,"oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from. "
29564,Raj,that works. 
31616,Raj,do you think he’s building a bomb?
29573,Raj,"all i’ve got is a needler, and i’m all out of ammo. "
31624,Raj,how did you get your hands on that?
31626,Raj,i don’t know.
29580,Raj,"no, no, not like haroun and tanweer."
33678,Raj,"uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
29582,Raj,"okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
31631,Raj,"yeah, well, i know how to make your egg salad now."
29588,Raj,"if you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
29589,Raj,why are you telling me about my own culture? 
31641,Raj,"howard, that’s not how we practiced it."
31642,Raj,just say it.
31644,Raj,"i know, but that sounds anti-semitic. anyway, i was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. the theme, movies that killed their franchises."
31645,Raj,"miss congeniality 2: armed and fabulous. i mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl sandy b can’t save it."
31653,Raj,"so, listen, i know we talked about getting a bite to eat in silver lake, and then seeing the christmas lights in griffith park, but leonard’s talking about a big d and d game at his place."
29606,Raj,"is there another penny here? i had such plans. i had dreams. i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astro-physics. but with a penis, of course. "
31654,Raj,"oh, man, the first monster i see, i’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
33707,Raj,over half a million dollars.
33709,Raj,"this is tough, but i’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me youtube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
29616,Raj,"you have lost so much weight! that must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! do you remember?"
33714,Raj,"he doesn’t just look like c-3po, now he walks like him."
33715,Raj,"it’s a human emotion, sheldon. everyone gets jealous. i’m jealous of leonard and penny and howard and bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
33716,Raj,sure.
31668,Raj,"great. i bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
31669,Raj,what?
33719,Raj,"hey, stuart. what are you doing here?"
31672,Raj,it’s true. i’m always attracted to women i can’t have. i do it all the time. i did the same thing with the two of you.
33722,Raj,"oh, but i bought chinese takeout."
33726,Raj,"well, they already had a village."
29631,Raj,yes mommy.
29632,Raj,"can we please stop talking about my testicles? sheldon, tell them what you did."
29633,Raj,sorry? that’s all you can say is sorry?
31680,Raj,"sometimes i get so lonely, i sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then i put it in my right hand and pretend i’m holding hands with another person."
31683,Raj,thank you. i hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
29636,Raj,"but papa, please…."
31684,Raj,damn it.
29638,Raj,go for stereo. 
29640,Raj,i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. but that’s something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. 
31693,Raj,your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
29646,Raj,shotgun.
31694,Raj,"i say you tell alex your heart belongs to penny, i provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later i give it to her good."
31696,Raj,how else am i supposed to talk to the human resources lady?
33747,Raj,"you’ll be happy i did. okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. you wanted to make an entrance. i get it. and here’s your daddy. when he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
31699,Raj,"well, this is all your fault."
31700,Raj,"if you weren’t screwing around with sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening."
31704,Raj,that is so cool.
29658,Raj,"as it turns out, yes."
31707,Raj,"and we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done."
29661,Raj,she was sleeping with you?
31709,Raj,phasers on the borg! charlie’s angels.
33763,Raj,"oh, great, now i can say things like i can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? yes, i’ll still help you move."
31715,Raj,insurance is gonna buy you a new car. it’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
31716,Raj,"and about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now."
31719,Raj,"don’t be like that. come on, howard, talk to him."
33768,Raj,"guys, she’s my goddaughter, i think i’ll know when i see her. that one."
33769,Raj,hello.
31722,Raj,okay. did we at least rent the car from enterprise? get it? enterprise? screw you. that’s funny.
33773,Raj,"she’s tired, that was funny."
29677,Raj,"hey, look at that.  it’s dennis kim."
29679,Raj,i’d be more interested in a scene depicting spock’s conception. 
31725,Raj,"so, i found this web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. how awesome is that?"
29681,Raj,good story.  
33778,Raj,have you tried anything to fix it?
33779,Raj,"i know. blue shag, what were you thinking?"
29682,Raj,okay. first order of physics bowl business. we need a truly kick-ass team name. suggestions.
29684,Raj,then we can be the bengal tigers.
29689,Raj,"you know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played tv’s blossom. she got a phd in neuroscience or something. "
33786,Raj,"okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and i will mark them down. "
31738,Raj,"oh, true. they’re practically giving them away. you know, in exchange for money."
33791,Raj,"hold on, i don’t think she was impressed."
31746,Raj,are you sure you want to do this? give up your half of the 3-d printer?
31748,Raj,aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
31749,Raj,here you go.
31752,Raj,cool. did she discover a cure for something?
29706,Raj,"congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
31754,Raj,"way to make lemonade. you know, from around the corner where fudge is made."
33806,Raj,"don’t worry, i’m a grown man. i have a thick skin."
33808,Raj,"okay, first off, i want to thank you all so much for coming. howard is here to interpret for emily, and to take notes. "
29716,Raj,twice a month.
31765,Raj,"okay, i guess."
29718,Raj,"also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 pasadena. "
33817,Raj,"yes, i’ll take you back."
29722,Raj,my turn! 
31769,Raj,"oh, boy. breakfast."
29726,Raj,"three hundred, and i’ll throw in my original 1979 mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effects. "
33823,Raj,"well, that was a waste of time. i’m such an idiot."
33824,Raj,maybe i won’t settle down. maybe i’ll just play the field.
29728,Raj,"oh, i call dibs on the golden age flash."
29729,Raj,"too bad, i called dibs."
33827,Raj,"but theoretically, if you and i were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? like, print up announcements?"
31775,Raj,"i’m trapped. my clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. i think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. what do i do?"
33829,Raj,"yeah. well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
33834,Raj,"hey, i was being hypothetical, okay? i would never marry you."
33835,Raj,"yeah, right. wait, is it rose gold? actually, don’t tell me, i want to be surprised."
31788,Raj,"then i’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion."
33837,Raj,"uh, the one at caltech has a crazy wait list. i warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
33838,Raj,whoa. just trying to help.
29742,Raj,"the indian sex book. in other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
31789,Raj,we’re glad you could make it.
31790,Raj,what is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
31794,Raj,"later, losers!"
29748,Raj,"i’m not happy, it’s the medication, i can’t stop smiling. "
31799,Raj,"no. i took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."
33850,Raj,how is that a t?
31802,Raj,"you’re wasting your time. just please, leave me alone."
31806,Raj,"you’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, i’ve made my choice."
33856,Raj,she was blowing a spit bubble. it was adorable.
29760,Raj,incredible. you managed to screw up the screw-up. 
33864,Raj,"what are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? what kind of father gives up on his son?"
31816,Raj,i lied. i love them. i only said that so you’d go out with me.
29770,Raj,did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
31821,Raj,thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
33870,Raj,it turns out he doesn’t care if i’m married or if i’m single. he’s basically given up on me.
29774,Raj,i hate trains. 
29786,Raj,doesn’t count.
33883,Raj,the housekeeper does the shopping.
31840,Raj,"couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?"
29794,Raj,"i bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  and he told me his name was kimberley!"
29796,Raj,sure.
29798,Raj,it’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
31848,Raj,it would be nice to have the increased income. stop taking money from my parents.
33900,Raj,like a business manager?
29805,Raj,thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
29810,Raj,the people from people.
31858,Raj,i have a thick accent. you don’t know what i said.
31859,Raj,"you two should be ashamed of yourselves. using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever amy plans on doing."
29813,Raj,"it’s very nice of you, i would like that."
31860,Raj,yes.
33912,Raj,"yeah, you’d think. ooh, maybe i could sell my blood and sperm."
33914,Raj,"oh, double stuffed oreos, i remember when i could afford you."
31868,Raj,"yes, mummy was right. american girls are sexually voracious devils."
33918,Raj,what’s this?
31870,Raj,"no, no, i don’t know if i should. if she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. it’s almost like i’m reading her diary."
31871,Raj,"no, this is creepy."
29825,Raj,"oh, i’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? in india we just call them untouchables."
33922,Raj,"i’ve been plenty of times. if i miss one, it’s fine. i’m a big boy."
33923,Raj,"that would be amazing. i was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
33924,Raj,i cannot thank you enough.
31877,Raj,"well, that doesn’t seem fair."
31881,Raj,"uh, lucy’s coming over. i need some advice."
31883,Raj,"good, black is more slimming. oh, that’s her. i got to go be butch. toodles. hey."
29837,Raj,"it was in the limo. they sent a limo. i have a limo. i just love saying limo. here, sip on this while you’re getting ready."
29838,Raj,that’s what you’re wearing.
31885,Raj,"yeah, well, i wouldn’t get too close. if i give the right command in german, she’ll rip your face off."
31890,Raj,i don’t know. maybe it’s all those steroids i’ve been taking.
33943,Raj,"maybe moving in was a bad idea. i haven’t been here one day, i’m already causing problems."
29847,Raj,"no, it’s time to put on some r. kelly and suck face."
31896,Raj,no. bought this at the staples center when i went to see taylor swift.
29851,Raj,"now you listen to me, i am no longer a child, and i will not be spoken to like one. now if you’d excuse me, i have to go throw up."
29852,Raj,why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
31901,Raj,and it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
33950,Raj,"i’m sorry, guys. sheldon was upset, leonard and penny were fighting, i just wanted to go some place where i wasn’t causing problems."
29855,Raj,i have a better idea.
31904,Raj,"hello? what do you mean, you found my dog? she’s with my friends. is she okay? oh, thank you. uh, just text me your address, i’m on my way. oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. but do not give her anything starchy. she’s having risotto for dinner."
33953,Raj,"well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
31905,Raj,hmm. interesting. did they take a walk down liars’ lane?
31906,Raj,"a lane frequented by liars. like you, you big liar."
31907,Raj,"well, i trusted you, and you let me down. the poor thing’s been shaking for hours."
29861,Raj,"damn, there’s always a catch."
31910,Raj,"sorry. i, i just…"
31913,Raj,i’m actually glad lucy had to work tonight. saved me the awkward conversation about how i was gonna be hanging with my bros.
29867,Raj,"not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment."
29871,Raj,"party with the pretty girls, dude!"
29874,Raj,"oh, pause it. that’s it. confirmed. we now have the address of the top model house."
29880,Raj,"okay, i think i got it. "
29881,Raj,what are negs?
29882,Raj,i saw what you did there.
31928,Raj,don’t be ridiculous. waiter?
29885,Raj,star trek v!
29886,Raj,i have three words for you. wrath of khan.
33983,Raj,"yeah. you know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
31933,Raj,"you don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
33986,Raj,"hang on, i’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. i just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
31938,Raj,"so, anyway, last night on video chat, i spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into lucy’s eyes."
31940,Raj,"i’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
29894,Raj,you told me you were going to have the talk with him.
33992,Raj,"are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? actually, never mind, don’t answer. i’d love to."
33993,Raj,"genius. i was gonna say, why does anyone think sheldon’s a genius? but i didn’t."
29896,Raj,for which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light leonard.”
29899,Raj,yeah.
31946,Raj,"okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
29903,Raj,of course not. look at her.
31952,Raj,good idea. bernadette?
29905,Raj,"it’s got a big bird on it, dude."
34003,Raj,"uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on colorado boulevard."
31958,Raj,we might as well go ahead and eat. she’s not coming back anytime soon.
29914,Raj,"oh, yeah, like you have a shot with zac ephron."
34011,Raj,"well, i’m very happy for you."
34012,Raj,can’t believe bert has a girlfriend and i don’t.
31962,Raj,"a little one. it’s, it’s a farewell for leonard, so all the attention will be on him. if you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
31967,Raj,"uh, go ahead. read it."
29922,Raj,"man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
31971,Raj,no.
31976,Raj,"no, it’s not. i haven’t had a drink since last night."
31979,Raj,"uh, no, water’s fine. anyhow, i’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and i totally see why lucy did what she did. i pushed too hard. but you know what? if i back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
29933,Raj,"but, sheldon, we don’t have a chance. the only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
34032,Raj,"could you say that in english? i actually, i never learned hindi."
34033,Raj,hey.
34034,Raj,"okay. shall we? oh, my god. it’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. you don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
29936,Raj,"come on, sheldon, you got this."
34036,Raj,"damn it, he’s good at that, too."
29944,Raj,fo’ shizzle.
31992,Raj,"oh, great. there go my chances of being sexually harassed."
29946,Raj,damn it. i had lysine and changed it.
31994,Raj,"you know, i recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
34044,Raj,really? you kept sending me apartment listings.
34048,Raj,"i am, but i’ll miss you guys."
29953,Raj,that’s how we missed it.
32001,Raj,"mrs. davis, i, uh, i must confess, i came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead i got to connect with you at a human level. that’s a much better evening. you’re a lovely person."
34051,Raj,"come on, sheldon. amy’s only gone for a few months. and now that i’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
34053,Raj,"well, here’s your key back."
34054,Raj,as soon as i have the place set up i’m gonna have you guys over.
29958,Raj,"oh, cool, i got a sword."
32005,Raj,who died and made you king of moments?
32009,Raj,"well, i’ve been quite enjoying that. it combines all the superhero fun of spider-man with all the body-switching shenanigans of freaky friday. both versions, original and lohan."
32010,Raj,"hey, what’s your problem?"
29963,Raj,"if anybody cares, i still have to pee."
29965,Raj,"nope, i think mocking you is more fun."
32015,Raj,"well, it’s kind of hard to tell. "
34064,Raj,do you see the way she’s looking at him?
29970,Raj,"god, i love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
34067,Raj,can you even eat those things?
32023,Raj,yay.
29977,Raj,"and plus, you got a rapid prototyper. that’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
34074,Raj,she’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
34075,Raj,i could have made her very happy.
21787,Raj,"oh, yeah, i saw that. that was hilarious. "
29981,Raj,"it’s not so bad, really. at least these trains have modern plumbing. in india, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan."
29980,Raj,what’s wrong with jiffy lubes?
32025,Raj,"uh, it wasn’t anything weird. it was just to see how big they were."
21792,Raj,you’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
29985,Raj,"no, you didn’t. i did."
32026,Raj,"uh, can i just say, i’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
29987,Raj,"sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
34084,Raj,"she’s so chatty. maybe my parents are right. maybe i’d be better off with an indian girl. we’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. "
32029,Raj,"don’t worry, i can take a hint. no more murder mystery parties."
34086,Raj,"hey. sorry i’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
32035,Raj,"okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
32040,Raj,i invited you to my murder mystery party.
32041,Raj,oh.
34090,Raj,we brought food.
32042,Raj,"oh, yes, leonard. yes, it was."
29996,Raj,yes?
32047,Raj,i just wanted to do something beautiful.
34096,Raj,"wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from india. i want you to meet my parents."
30003,Raj,"you know, if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this, i could have stayed in india."
32053,Raj,"come on. one more time. yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but i think that works in your favour. do you want a beer?"
34106,Raj,stairwell.
32058,Raj,"okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
34108,Raj,that’s still not funny.
34109,Raj,and she was my second cousin.
30012,Raj,the wolowitz coefficient?
34111,Raj,"namaste, white people. good news! i rented us the four-hour edition of watchmen."
32060,Raj,"three, two, one. "
32064,Raj,"in the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. how many of them have sent us messages?"
34114,Raj,"so, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
30020,Raj,why?
34122,Raj,you are my heart!
30026,Raj,interesting. are you a droid?
34124,Raj,who is it?
34125,Raj,"oh, guess who."
30029,Raj,are you spock?
34127,Raj,"sheldon, i’m talking to someone. you’re being rude. i’ll bet you’re an actress. if not, you should be. you have a very expressive face."
30032,Raj,"is it me, or was that sheldon’s way of saying vegas baby!"
32080,Raj,that’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
34130,Raj,can i sleep here tonight?
34131,Raj,"hey, look who decided to show up."
30035,Raj,what are you going to tell your mother?
32081,Raj,you want a tums?
30038,Raj,"oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
34135,Raj,"hello mummy, daddy, how are you?"
30039,Raj,sounds like a plan.
32086,Raj,that is so beautiful.
32088,Raj,fine. i will melt her heart. and her face.
34140,Raj,no!
34142,Raj,"oh, just because i’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? maybe something good happened."
30046,Raj,what? no. ..
34145,Raj,that’s a fitting pun-ishment. i still don’t know what you do for a living.
32097,Raj,"got it. now, uh, i have a question about the song. i was thinking at some point i could bust out a little rap."
34151,Raj,"oh, no."
34152,Raj,"all right, teams. get ready to open your first puzzle. go. do you see what i did? the first puzzle is a puzzle. oh, my god, how adorable is that? i wish i had a friend like me."
30059,Raj,a little baby.
30063,Raj,"he’s right. this is an important achievement, for two reasons. number one, and, of course, number two."
32111,Raj,thank you.
34161,Raj,"hey, claire. hi. it’s, it’s rajesh. i was, i was wondering if you’re free for valentine’s day?"
30065,Raj,interesting. penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
30066,Raj,he can’t figure out how to fix it.
32116,Raj,i didn’t know you were coming again.
30071,Raj,"be afraid of penny, nice, very crafty."
30073,Raj,"it’s not superstition. it’s practically newtonian. for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. it’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
30078,Raj,"that what that’s for? in india, the lid just touches the cheese. of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
34175,Raj,what fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
30080,Raj,"wow, that’s heavy."
32128,Raj,not even to sleep?
34178,Raj,hello.
32130,Raj,i don’t get it.
34182,Raj,that’s equally effective.
30089,Raj,"me, too."
32137,Raj,"well, can i say she looks nice?"
34188,Raj,huh. that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. we could take some more simulated instrument readings.
30092,Raj,me either.
32143,Raj,"well, and i ate all the crumb cake. we both made mistakes."
32145,Raj,"i think i know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
30098,Raj,i say double feature.
30099,Raj,it was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
32146,Raj,"this is all your fault, i should’ve listened to mun-mun because i’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is penny. why are you so cruel? do you enjoy my pain?"
32147,Raj,"i love you, penny."
32151,Raj,it’s horrible. why would you push a cow over? they’re sacred.
32152,Raj,"hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
30108,Raj,i like the new look.
32156,Raj,"great. that makes one of you. okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. that’s right, i see you. okay, if you have any questions, i’ll be over here basting my ass off. focus is key."
30110,Raj,i feel bad for the guy.
30111,Raj,"well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
32158,Raj,"no, no, speak up. i’m about to use the blender, and i don’t want to miss anything."
32163,Raj,"well, i couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. martha stewart and rachael ray."
30118,Raj,"yeah, but since you and penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
30120,Raj,"okay, who had leonard gets a floppy disk?"
32169,Raj,"hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did i tell you how to fix it? no. i said, aw, that must hurt, and i rubbed your belly."
32171,Raj,there’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. and it’s when you’re ten.
30126,Raj,"whatever, dude. the point is, leonard’s got one and you don’t."
32174,Raj,he loves you.
30131,Raj,"great. now how are you going to settle it, hmm? there is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
32179,Raj,hang on.
32180,Raj,nonsense. you need a little fattening up. you’ve been looking too skinny lately.
30134,Raj,"my stomach. indian food doesn’t agree with me. ironic, isn’t it?"
32183,Raj,"look, i’m sorry you’re upset with me, but i just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
30136,Raj,be careful.
32184,Raj,"i can’t believe they’re still married. oh, no, i forgot cinnamon’s toothbrush at howard’s. i guess you’re sharing with daddy again. "
32186,Raj,"and, amy, you need to be patient with sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
30147,Raj,"oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
30149,Raj,"well, i finished reading the pelican brief and loved it so much, i dived right into the client. he was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
32199,Raj,"my father’s a gynaecologist, i think i can handle it. and, now, i’m gay."
32203,Raj,"yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding."
32204,Raj,"yeah, i was wrong. but i do think you and i would have had a great time."
32210,Raj,"ooh, mark harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
30163,Raj,dark and fun.
32211,Raj,so i read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
32218,Raj,no. no pretty girls. the point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
30173,Raj,"i like it, i like it. did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
30177,Raj,i’m sorry. go on.
32226,Raj,"okay, nice talking to you."
32232,Raj,and does sheldon know you’re dating sheldon?
32233,Raj,"yeah, knock it off, howard."
30186,Raj,"so, my visa’s only good as long as i’m employed at the university, and when they find out i’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. by the way, when i say squat, i mean diddly-squat. i wish i had squat."
30189,Raj,"oh, beef, i’m going to miss you so much. do you know, at the mumbai mcdonald’s, you can’t get a big mac? all you can get is a chicken maharaja mac. and the special sauce, curry, which, in india,"
30192,Raj,i’m sad.
30193,Raj,what are you eating?
32243,Raj,"so we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?"
32245,Raj,"oh, it all comes down to this."
30200,Raj,i’m on it.
30202,Raj,"it’s a little early, isn’t it?"
32250,Raj,"oh, they only have thursday and sunday passes left."
30206,Raj,"thank you. would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? so, when do i start?"
30207,Raj,"you know, he’s british, i’m indian, ever since gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
30208,Raj,"that’s okay. a complaint has been filed. so, that’s it. that was my last hope. i’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin sanjay. or, as you may know him, dave from at&t customer service."
30211,Raj,no.
32261,Raj,that’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
30218,Raj,then you leave me no choice. i accept the job.
32266,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
30227,Raj,i need an aspirin.
30228,Raj,thank you.
30229,Raj,yes.
30230,Raj,"no, no, no, no! that rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
30231,Raj,i’m the astrophysicist. astro means space.
30232,Raj,"okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, i’d be kicking your butt."
32276,Raj,"oh, my god, cinnamon, are you okay? i can’t believe you two. you do whatever it takes to save her life. if she needs new organs, i’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
30234,Raj,"my god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. well, let me tell you something. some of those thoughts are pure caca."
32280,Raj,"oh, is cinnamon gonna be okay?"
30239,Raj,let me finish.
30240,Raj,"i’m not defacing it, i’m fixing it."
32287,Raj,"oh, actually that’s a van dyke. a goatee is just hair on the chin."
32293,Raj,magic wand tv remote?
30246,Raj,"what do you want, sheldon?"
32304,Raj,not at all. he’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. it’s like me in those moments when i miss india.
30261,Raj,why don’t i just tell you what i heard today.
30262,Raj,"saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a mystic warlords of ka-ah tournament. first prize is five hundred dollars. if we team up, we’d be unstoppable."
32311,Raj,like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
30264,Raj,but this is other money.
32312,Raj,"and how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. and you threw up again. and so on and so on."
30266,Raj,"leonard, help."
32314,Raj,screw that! i sat on the floor for seven years. i’m staying right here.
32315,Raj,fine. but no more making fun of how i say tings.
32325,Raj,"i don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so i’ll put up with it."
30278,Raj,lava serpent.
30280,Raj,"okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! now, come on, sheldon, finish him off!"
32340,Raj,but i’m always on howard’s team. we’re best friends. the kind who finish each others…
32343,Raj,plane tickets? yeah.
30301,Raj,fine. paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
30302,Raj,it’s open.
30303,Raj,what do you want?
30304,Raj,"the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang, an indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from new delhi. it took me a day to put together and two days to paint. this is hello kitty."
30305,Raj,"wow, you just don’t get it, do you? buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
30311,Raj,"no, i’m mad at you. i hate myself, but i’m mad at you."
32363,Raj,stuart?
30320,Raj,"yeah. absolutely. it wouldn’t kill you to take a pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
30321,Raj,"actually, in this case, i think she was."
30322,Raj,yeah.
32373,Raj,"great, everyone’s a byomkesh bakshi. now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
30328,Raj,"really! did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, howard, i am upset."
30330,Raj,sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that i had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? rice!
30331,Raj,"oh, my god, you are such a mama’s boy."
30332,Raj,you brought your mother into this!
32378,Raj,"yeah, i was. i was 200 pounds by the time i was in middle school. kids were mean. cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. anyway, i was pretty lonely, so i had to make up my own stories and games, and i promised myself if i ever made any friends that, that i would play those games with them."
30336,Raj,i don’t care! and why don’t you think i can find a woman for myself?
32385,Raj,perhaps this will help. here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
32386,Raj,"oh, no. in this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after i became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, madonna."
30344,Raj,wow. wonderful. how old are they?
32392,Raj,thank you. i thought it was inspired.
30354,Raj,"okay, how’s that?"
32404,Raj,"uh, xbox one."
32407,Raj,what am i supposed to do? how am i supposed to choose between emily and lucy?
30360,Raj,"i know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
30361,Raj,"oh, i’m so hungry!"
30362,Raj,he’s right.
30363,Raj,"me, too. but what? "
32412,Raj,did he help you make a decision about the movie?
30366,Raj,"actually, i’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
32414,Raj,"you look, you look really pretty tonight."
30369,Raj,i thought it was funny.
32420,Raj,"are you, are you sure? because this is the part of the night where i’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
30376,Raj,foamy vengeance.
30379,Raj,i believe that’s the president of the university.
32428,Raj,at least now i can focus all my energies on just one girl.
30383,Raj,"ha! eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
30386,Raj,"well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
32435,Raj,you better be. no jokes about how close i am with my dog. or the truth about how close i am with my dog.
30398,Raj,"oh, boy."
30401,Raj,"sheldon, i’m begging you. i want to go to this mixer, and i don’t want to go alone."
30403,Raj,thanks for coming with me.
30404,Raj,did you really have to bring it in with you?
30412,Raj,"not so loud, but ideally, yes. thanks."
32461,Raj,i’m just gonna say it. that’s not okay. why can’t i be in a relationship with a girl who likes the sound of music?
32465,Raj,"and i have to be honest, i thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
32467,Raj,sure.
30420,Raj,"जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. that’s hindi for whatever floats your boat. uh, listen, i got a text from that girl abby, and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again. what do you say?"
30422,Raj,"please, sheldon, i’m a lost indian boy far from home, and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring martha."
32473,Raj,"hey, uh, sheldon, you want anything?"
30428,Raj,so?
30430,Raj,"no, no, no, no, i think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
30431,Raj,there’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
30434,Raj,"no, it’s okay. i don’t have to go. i’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. i’m a walking brown yelp.com."
30442,Raj,i’m on a cloud. swing me. 
30444,Raj,thank you.
30445,Raj,me.
32492,Raj,is that a real thing?
30448,Raj,it’s okay. i don’t mind hearing about your sex life. it’s his that bugs me.
30450,Raj,"no way, dude!"
32511,Raj,eleven. wait. do i count the 200-pound sailor moon girl that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con?
32512,Raj,i’ll stick with eleven. she liked howard better.
30466,Raj,"bruce banner, reed richards, sue storm, stephen strange, otto octavius, silver surfer, peter parker, oh, and worst of all, j. jonah jameson, jr."
32515,Raj,"of course. please, come in."
30469,Raj,"hey, i didn’t even mention dum dum dugan or green goblin, matt murdock, pepper potts, victor von doom, oh, and worst of all, millie the model."
30471,Raj,"and worst of all, fin fang foom."
30472,Raj,and an aquaman action figure.
32519,Raj,"thank you. not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
32522,Raj,i don’t. i have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
32525,Raj,"but, uh, before i take my shirt off, i just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
32526,Raj,"what up, guys?"
32527,Raj,and i thought me having sex with emily was gonna be the big news.
30481,Raj,who else could it be? it has to be eddie crispo.
30489,Raj,"gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
32538,Raj,"wow. how’s that hater-ade taste, bro? hey, this isn’t the way to work."
32540,Raj,how so?
30497,Raj,"wait, my laptop. "
32552,Raj,"hey, as long as the baby’s healthy."
30505,Raj,why don’t we go after your mother?
32553,Raj,"but half-man, half-owl could fly…"
32555,Raj,"oh, well, her last name is sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about koothrapeeney."
32557,Raj,you enjoy giving people grades.
30519,Raj,"well, good for him."
32567,Raj,you look like a jackass.
30521,Raj,"yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. it turned brown while you were talking."
32568,Raj,"so you never played baseball as a kid, not even little league?"
30524,Raj,what?
30526,Raj,do you want to do this or not?
32580,Raj,"emily, you know almost everybody here."
32583,Raj,"you know, he might not reopen. he didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company."
30538,Raj,interesting. that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. you know what i’m talking about.
32586,Raj,"ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
32587,Raj,we are now.
30541,Raj,"really? because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
32588,Raj,"um, well, in my defence, i tell everybody."
32591,Raj,"well, i would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list."
30546,Raj,"yeah, i think we’re getting close."
30557,Raj,"hey, leonard?"
32611,Raj,"for your information, emily is working tonight."
32613,Raj,"oh. it’s wonderful, and i swear i’m not saying that because justin timberlake is in it."
30566,Raj,"but we’ll have sex first, right?"
30571,Raj,i don’t know. do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah?
30575,Raj,no.
30583,Raj,"relax, it’s nyquil."
32632,Raj,"you know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
30585,Raj,"did you get a cold, too?"
32633,Raj,"you know, sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
32639,Raj,"oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
32640,Raj,"well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket."
32641,Raj,"look, i get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, i was thinking about when howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
32642,Raj,exactly.
30599,Raj,good?
30601,Raj,"follow my lead. almost. we’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
32652,Raj,"well, that’s what we wanted. this is as hot as the mines will be."
30605,Raj,"wait a second, the good wife is crying. something’s very wrong."
30606,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
32655,Raj,do you know any mining songs?
30615,Raj,"yeah, look. breasts and everything."
30617,Raj,do you know what he’s talking about?
30619,Raj,that was a lousy suggestion.
30625,Raj,"but it’s true. but we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. her name is amy farrah fowler."
30626,Raj,"howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but i said no, our sheldon would say hokum."
32676,Raj,preach.
32678,Raj,"hey, we’re going to oliver’s house to see his collection. you want to go with us?"
30635,Raj,where does he poop?
30636,Raj,"what would a toilet look like in atlantis? how would you flush it? and when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
30637,Raj,you slipped and fell into a robot hand?
30642,Raj,"right now, all i can think about is cookies and hawaiian punch."
30644,Raj,now can we have cookies and hawaiian punch?
30645,Raj,that’s my joke. i told it last night. you can’t just use it.
30647,Raj,i’m a lamb.
32698,Raj,"it was our first date, there was an awkward silence. what was i supposed to say?"
30651,Raj,it’s a potty. what do you call it?
32699,Raj,this is so messed up.
32700,Raj,"okay. here we go, say cheese. iskip) say cheese. iskip) say cousin. iskip) say…"
32701,Raj,"oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and i can’t think of a thing to get them."
32703,Raj,"they used to like going to the mumbai symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
30657,Raj,"philadelphia. okay, now i get it."
30658,Raj,"i’m very comfortable here. penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
32706,Raj,"uh, that was my dad on the phone. he moved out."
30660,Raj,"well, if that’s the case, penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
30661,Raj,"oh, god, never again."
32713,Raj,"i think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
30669,Raj,"don’t try to change me, dude. i am what i am."
32717,Raj,"you know, i thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then i found his dentures and realized it’s also gross."
30672,Raj,"oh, you’re so arrogant. if you were a superhero, your name would be captain arrogant. and you know what your superpower would be? arrogance."
30675,Raj,you’re being unreasonable. why can’t i have a desk?
30677,Raj,but i can’t have one.
30678,Raj,"oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of red vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
30685,Raj,one more time?
32733,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
32737,Raj,"amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. i gave up when no one cared about my tom hanks-giving."
30690,Raj,no.
32738,Raj,you guys suck.
30692,Raj,knock yourself out.
30693,Raj,no.
32743,Raj,yup. bye.
32745,Raj,should have put it in the bag first.
32746,Raj,hey.
30700,Raj,"it’s not gonna work, dude, i grew up in india, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
32751,Raj,come on.
32754,Raj,"dude, it’s not breathing."
30716,Raj,did you pinky swear?
30717,Raj,okay then.
32767,Raj,i’m worried about the new horizons space probe.
40962,Sheldon,"howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"
40963,Sheldon,"wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally."
40967,Sheldon,"please, leonard, he said it’s okay."
40968,Sheldon,"howard, i have a few questions. i found three bowling pins. now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?"
40972,Sheldon,"wait, can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?"
40976,Sheldon,"oh, dear. my mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city."
40980,Sheldon,"well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. you know. that doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and i’m a trash can full of sweets."
40988,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll tell you. my goodness, everyone’s on their game today."
40989,Sheldon,my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead.
40992,Sheldon,i panicked. he looked taller than usual.
40993,Sheldon,"it’s simple, really. it occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. the, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once."
40998,Sheldon,i would like to change mine. the pirate’s name was peg-leg antoine. now it’s completely different from goonies.
41000,Sheldon,"you know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing i read in the closet. bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages."
41007,Sheldon,"excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. a guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. if we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."
41010,Sheldon,pchew! pchew! pchew! pchew!
41017,Sheldon,"but i suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. let’s see. oh, janine davis. oh, dear."
41019,Sheldon,even you. you’re a slave.
41023,Sheldon,the tragic history of slavery in america. fun for the whole family.
41027,Sheldon,"i won’t be able to make our date night this thursday, so, bad news for you."
41034,Sheldon,glad.
41036,Sheldon,fine. bad.
41041,Sheldon,"well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. don’t just stand there. take your breasts out."
41043,Sheldon,"okay, because that was not clear."
41047,Sheldon,"i don’t know what you’re doing, but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with raj’s mother for a dollar."
41050,Sheldon,"wait. hold on. i believe screw it, i’m going in is what i said to your mother last night. don’t worry, i didn’t really say that. i find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
41052,Sheldon,"i just found out that you recommended myself, dr. hofstadter and dr. koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
41056,Sheldon,"yeah, right on, sister."
41057,Sheldon,"oh, dear. penny, have you been recording shows on our dvr again?"
41058,Sheldon,answer honestly. this is not a trial. that’ll come later.
41060,Sheldon,i’m deleting it.
41070,Sheldon,"oh, quite sure.  that proves nothing."
41073,Sheldon,by playing tic-tac-toe?
41078,Sheldon,yes.
41081,Sheldon,"amy, i must say, i was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
41082,Sheldon,"well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…"
41094,Sheldon,of course i do.
41099,Sheldon,i’m getting worried.
41101,Sheldon,the third floor landing. the poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. it’s really you.
41106,Sheldon,"oh, no, there are no kids. no, the, the show’s for me. come on. i’ll race ya, arthur."
41107,Sheldon,"yes. and if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
41109,Sheldon,"oh, no. how could anybody hate gino the neutrino? it’s nice, huh? i got him for 20 bucks on ebay. including the shipping!"
41122,Sheldon,"met my childhood hero, now i get to ride in an ambulance. boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever."
41131,Sheldon,"so, in a way it’s like i’m your son."
41133,Sheldon,dungeons & dragons.
41134,Sheldon,"i’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. hello, new dice smell."
41139,Sheldon,"go on, give him your lunch money."
41144,Sheldon,"well, i’ve just never played dungeons & dragons with girls before."
41146,Sheldon,"yeah, we, now, penny, we don’t consume alcohol during dungeons & dragons. it impairs our judgment."
41147,Sheldon,"okay, literal goose bumps. look."
41151,Sheldon,yay!
41152,Sheldon,"yeah, uh, wait. doesn’t he say something first? you know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
41156,Sheldon,another quest by wolowitz? count me in.
41159,Sheldon,i’ve never knocked on my own door before. that was a wild ride.
41163,Sheldon,and now what?
41172,Sheldon,"yeah, i used to be uncomfortable around people, but then i learned a trick. i pretend everyone i meet is a beloved character from star trek."
41183,Sheldon,"leonard, you’re being selfish. we need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
41186,Sheldon,"this is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
41189,Sheldon,"it’s not that big of an opportunity. and even if hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. i mean, me? i’m interested in the big questions."
41195,Sheldon,wow. no wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
41196,Sheldon,"um, can i have your attention, everyone?  that’s, uh, b-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. i would like to propose a toast to my best friend, dr. leonard hofstadter. he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and i couldn’t be happier for him."
41200,Sheldon,"penny, we’re in the red zone. the white zone is for loading and unloading. we’re breaking the law."
41206,Sheldon,"back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case, and back to the future iii was, get this, in the back to the future ii case."
41211,Sheldon, penny. 
41213,Sheldon,"to be honest, i did."
41229,Sheldon,my queen can now take your rook from below.
41233,Sheldon,"oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
41236,Sheldon,you were.
41240,Sheldon,"oh, no, i don’t think that’s true at all."
41242,Sheldon,"actually, i can’t. before leonard left, he made me promise that i’d take care of you."
41244,Sheldon,"plus, if i do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
41250,Sheldon,i own nine pairs of pants.
41262,Sheldon,now i know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
41265,Sheldon,"joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. with leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
41276,Sheldon,"oh, penny, i see you’ve ordered pizza. i have chinese food. "
41281,Sheldon,"i’m quite familiar with plumbing. not to brag, but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
41285,Sheldon,there are takeout containers in the trash can.
41291,Sheldon,"uh, elephant?"
41300,Sheldon,"please. why would leonard come home early and waste his time kissing penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? yeah, that’s it. i’m catching her in the act. "
41305,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. you find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
41306,Sheldon,"well, leonard, i think it’s high time you and i address the tweepadock in the room."
41308,Sheldon,"fine. leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
41309,Sheldon,"no, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with penny."
41310,Sheldon,you honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
41312,Sheldon,hello.
41315,Sheldon,"okay. by the way, you have something on your shirt."
41321,Sheldon,"you say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
41328,Sheldon,"careful, amy. the friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy. "
41330,Sheldon,maybe there’s a third option.
41332,Sheldon,"a crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
41333,Sheldon,or a mutant army. it depends on how my kickstarter goes.
41339,Sheldon,yeah.
41347,Sheldon,he is a born showman.
41359,Sheldon,"it is a marathon, not a sprint."
41360,Sheldon,not with a bowling ball on their back.
41377,Sheldon,"no, no, that’s not mine. it has a big spot on it."
41379,Sheldon,be there in a minute. i just have to pre-soak these.
41384,Sheldon,"oh, i see your confusion. you don’t understand. indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
41390,Sheldon,"of course. you know, why couldn’t she just like ziggy? yeah? that thing’s riddled with plot holes."
41391,Sheldon,"ooh, i think she’s a fan of garfield as well. oh, darn it, now so am i."
41395,Sheldon,i’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
41397,Sheldon,"um, i’m putting on lotion. are you in or not?"
41403,Sheldon,"fine. i’m mad at you. not only did you ruin raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
41404,Sheldon,thank you.
41413,Sheldon,really?
41415,Sheldon,"not as relieved as i’m about to be. it’s a brave new world, little lady."
41418,Sheldon,"well, i appreciate your concern, but i won’t be seeing any more of amy than i already do. i assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
41425,Sheldon,"last week, you told leonard he couldn’t wear his wookie jacket out in public."
41430,Sheldon,"howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with sheldon misunderstood. that’s a dead giveaway."
41439,Sheldon,"it’s a physical relationship, too. hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. ow. okay, here’s a new one. apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. how do you like it when i do it to you? not so much, huh?"
41442,Sheldon,"oh, baguettes. yes, i like baguettes. what exactly are you doing?"
41443,Sheldon,"so, goofing off. as i was saying, i’m done with work and leonard’s not. so good news, you get to take me home. play your cards right, i’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
41445,Sheldon,aw. embarrassed you?
41451,Sheldon,did you know that los angeles has a little sri lanka?
41463,Sheldon,"well, i cannot give this stuff away."
41466,Sheldon,"my point is, we’re a couple, and i like you for who you are, quirks and all."
41471,Sheldon,when did we get to the cheesecake factory?
41474,Sheldon,"leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
41475,Sheldon,"look at it. i feel like my mind just made a baby. and it’s beautiful. it’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
41481,Sheldon,"now give me that cookie, i discovered an element."
41484,Sheldon,"well, you should be. my discovery is spreading like wildfire. unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
41488,Sheldon,"this table, it’s in square centimetres. i read it as square metres. you know what that means?"
41493,Sheldon,"oh, great. now i’m worse than a fraud. i’m practically a biologist."
41495,Sheldon,"no, leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows. i’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
41496,Sheldon,"you know, frankly, i’d prefer a sex tape."
41498,Sheldon,stop it. stop celebrating me.
41503,Sheldon,you’re not?
41506,Sheldon,"i hate to pile on the bad news, but i just got a raise."
41508,Sheldon,"is it me, or does she not look so good?"
41511,Sheldon,you distract me. i’ve been distracted since the moment i met you. 
41512,Sheldon,"well, you should be. because all i can think about is how much i want to kiss you. and not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. like mommies and daddies do."
41514,Sheldon,"hey, isn’t that professor proton?"
41521,Sheldon,"no, no, no. i’m really good at this. all right, give me a hint. does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
41522,Sheldon,"but i’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. look how happy he is."
41524,Sheldon,"that’s strange. that he would come to you for that and not me. oh, i got two emails from him. do you have leonard’s email address? and. never mind, i found it. i can’t believe he picked you over me."
41527,Sheldon,"yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
41530,Sheldon,"that’s kind of a stretch. look, when it comes to social skills, i’ve mastered the big three. there’s the coy smile. there’s the friendly chuckle. there’s the vocalization of sympathy. aw. that last one’s tricky, i’m still working on it."
41567,Sheldon,"that seems like a reasonable request. although so did, hey, leonard, would you mind returning that dvd?"
41574,Sheldon,you say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. i say situations like this make me feel the same way. 
41579,Sheldon,i’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
41587,Sheldon,how is it i can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
41598,Sheldon,"oh, since you put it that way, i’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
41612,Sheldon,they passed against a nickel defence. they should have run it off-tackle.
41629,Sheldon,i just vomited on a lot of clowns.
41630,Sheldon,"thank you. uh, the university made me come here. i didn’t want to. uh, big fan of the show."
41633,Sheldon,can we talk about something else? do you know that i yodel?
41654,Sheldon,really?
41655,Sheldon,so no more interviews?
41656,Sheldon,i can’t believe it.
41666,Sheldon,"i have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so i agree."
41673,Sheldon,what’s that animal doing in our apartment?
41675,Sheldon,it probably won’t.
41679,Sheldon,i believe i can answer that.
41681,Sheldon,"you’re telling it wrong. ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. a small town in east texas, where a young genius named…"
41685,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t just say smart things about science. i also yodel. "
41691,Sheldon,yes. i’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. lucky duck.
41698,Sheldon,and turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic slip ‘n slide.
41704,Sheldon,"of course i’m doing laundry. saturday night is laundry night, and i’m in a laundry room, so, i believe your inference is justified."
41710,Sheldon,i don’t know. i just got back. 
41712,Sheldon,that’s it. the baby’s here. it’s a boy.
41713,Sheldon,"oh, thank you. i wasn’t sure i was gonna to make it. but my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and i just thought to myself, sheldon, if you can make it through the green lantern movie, you can make it through this."
41718,Sheldon,"me, too. i got a lot of tv to catch up on."
41720,Sheldon,i would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
41730,Sheldon,i think i’m hysterical.
41736,Sheldon,i’ve never seen this show before and now i’m starting with episode 246? it’s unnatural.
41740,Sheldon,"this is interesting. apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. "
41745,Sheldon,ointment?
41750,Sheldon,but i used science to construct the perfect joke.
41758,Sheldon,does that mean the relationship is over?
41778,Sheldon,i’m on vacation. what do you think?
41784,Sheldon,wow. didn’t see that coming.
41787,Sheldon,"a fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
41789,Sheldon,why do you ask?
41797,Sheldon,i’m willing to if you guys are.
41799,Sheldon,penny?
41808,Sheldon,"it’s live. go, go, go, go, go."
41822,Sheldon,you don’t know that. i still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
41824,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
41826,Sheldon,"simple. earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. i googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. that’s where he’ll be, and that’s where i’m going, and…"
41830,Sheldon,"me, too. but he wasn’t, was he?"
41837,Sheldon,"in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
41851,Sheldon,"i hate every word in that sentence. including in, at, we and a."
41857,Sheldon,"wow. i’m feeling the urge to hug you. and one, and two, all right, gollum, we’re good."
41859,Sheldon,"oh, i’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
41865,Sheldon,get out of town.
41866,Sheldon,"do another one, do another one."
41869,Sheldon,wow. your life’s amazing.
41885,Sheldon,"let’s see. what’s next? oh, kissing’s romantic."
41902,Sheldon,"think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home."
41905,Sheldon,wait. is this really worth it? we’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
41909,Sheldon,you’re absolutely right. nope.
41911,Sheldon,"what about the roommate agreement? it specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the furnishing committee. which only sits on alternate years. yeah, and by the way, it sits over there."
41914,Sheldon,that’s not true.
41928,Sheldon,"okay. i’m sorry i gave you such a hard time, i just had to be sure."
41930,Sheldon,"no. sorry to disappoint you, but amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me."
41932,Sheldon,"yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
41949,Sheldon,hello.
41952,Sheldon,"that’s a great idea. and in the spirit of our new arrangement, i will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
41954,Sheldon,i’m glad because i would not have seen that coming.
41957,Sheldon,remember the old days when i used to point out that your check engine light was on?
41958,Sheldon,"well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. penny, your check engine…"
41960,Sheldon,"oh, in that case, i’d like to be partnered with my good friend howard."
41962,Sheldon,"it is. you were wrong, friend howard. she completely understood."
41967,Sheldon, howard?
41975,Sheldon,but i still need to use the bathroom.
41998,Sheldon,"okay, let’s do this."
42002,Sheldon,"earlier, i came here to surprise you. i looked in the window and i saw you with a man."
42007,Sheldon,"perhaps not. but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of ethan allen’s finest sofas."
42013,Sheldon,apparently any man is welcome in this house. why not you? i thought you were waiting in the car.
42014,Sheldon,no. i’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
42016,Sheldon,i didn’t know she did.
42017,Sheldon,what did you do?
42021,Sheldon,i am.
42029,Sheldon,"boy, do i have to urinate."
42034,Sheldon,here come the waterworks.
42038,Sheldon,"okay, now, the ps4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
42042,Sheldon,see? that’s what i thought. but then they go and throw in an esram buffer.
42044,Sheldon,"no, i am not. and this esram buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two ram types."
42046,Sheldon,good night.
42058,Sheldon,"yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record the macneil/lehrer report. now i also was certain that hd dvd would win out over blu-ray."
42060,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. it’s an mp3 player brought to us by the makers of xbox."
42076,Sheldon,why would you do that? you’re a string theorist as well.
42082,Sheldon,you mean your acting career?
42088,Sheldon,"break it off, shake hands, walk away."
42090,Sheldon,"i am. yeah, penny pointed out that what i’m going through is essentially a breakup. and according to cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
42093,Sheldon,"it was. this seemed so elegant at the time, but now i realize i was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
42095,Sheldon,the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
42098,Sheldon,"oh, i’m in your hands. do a good job and i’ll tell you cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your pms."
42103,Sheldon,she’s right. i’m too hot.
42104,Sheldon,"oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. why do we have a geology book? leonard, did you throw a children’s party while i was in texas?"
42111,Sheldon,a bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
42136,Sheldon,all right.
42146,Sheldon,"and amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
42149,Sheldon,i don’t understand my food. chinese noodles with korean barbecue in a taco.
42151,Sheldon,not at all.
42176,Sheldon,professor proton is dead?
42182,Sheldon,"oh, i’m not going to the funeral."
42183,Sheldon,"all those people blowing their noses. you can’t tell the sick from the sad. mm. i’ll be at home celebrating star wars day, as planned."
42184,Sheldon,"amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
42187,Sheldon,i’m fine.
42191,Sheldon,"howard, i think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
42197,Sheldon,i know why. you’ve come to me because you’re my obi-wan.
42224,Sheldon,i brought my own. no sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
42225,Sheldon,"well, until they invent nose condoms, i’m not finding out."
42230,Sheldon,"oh, quite all right. after my forehead melanoma scare i’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. well, sorry, i don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
42231,Sheldon,"no, i do. you’re upset about emily and you’re indian. i need to make you chai tea. now, i have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. do you happen to have any on you?"
42232,Sheldon,"oh, i’ll make english breakfast tea. they destroyed your culture. that’s close enough. you know, i’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man?"
42233,Sheldon,can’t happen. we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
42240,Sheldon,how many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
42246,Sheldon,i just got called into president siebert’s office. the university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. they’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
42252,Sheldon,you’re right. i’ll take that out.
42257,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, well, i’ve already given this some thought, and i’m willing to let penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
42268,Sheldon,"ugh, it’s like walking into the amazon. and not the good amazon with one-day shipping. the awful one with birds and snakes."
42270,Sheldon,i don’t know. perhaps.
42274,Sheldon,no.
42276,Sheldon,and you couldn’t put it out?
42278,Sheldon,"so, tomorrow?"
42286,Sheldon,don’t be melodramatic. i’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
42292,Sheldon,"leonard, i am overwhelmed. everything is changing and it’s simply too much. i need to get away and think."
42311,Sheldon,"you know, sherlock holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. but i’m sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick."
42312,Sheldon,"leonard. oh, i’m so happy to see you."
42324,Sheldon,"oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. you idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
42326,Sheldon,yes.
42332,Sheldon,"indeed. i was the world’s smartest caterpillar. and then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, i’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly."
42336,Sheldon,"yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the cloud."
42337,Sheldon,"here, day one, uh, this was the seat i was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. as it was first class, i suspect ritz. this is the train bathroom. this is the imodium i took so i would never have to use the train bathroom."
42343,Sheldon,swish.
42357,Sheldon,"a valid point, but unoriginal. b-minus."
42359,Sheldon,"it is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. feynman, einstein, professor x. humorously, in the case of professor x, some of his students actually had wings. that’s rich. i’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
42361,Sheldon,no one signed up.
42364,Sheldon,"oh, yes. fig newtons. i was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? and then after someone said newton, i was going to tell them they’re wrong. the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts. and then i’d throw the cookies away."
42366,Sheldon,"oh, howard. i appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. i don’t think you’d understand a single thing i was talking about."
42367,Sheldon,no.
42373,Sheldon,i am trying to prepare my lesson plan for howard. why are you telling me this?
42375,Sheldon,not now.
42379,Sheldon,"interesting point. you’re suggesting that i have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
34191,Sheldon,thank you very much.
34192,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. that was me having fun with you. look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. yes, that’s how you say it. but, you possess an intelligence i envy. which leads me to my answer. i would choose the ability to read people’s minds."
42385,Sheldon,good. and how it relates to the calculus of variations?
34195,Sheldon,"oh, yeah."
42387,Sheldon,"ha! i knew it. all right. we have a lot of information to cover before your first test. which, by the way, is in eight minutes. the good news is i’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a c."
42389,Sheldon,what are you doing?
42390,Sheldon,will you stop it. this is a classroom. this is not american bandstand.
42391,Sheldon,"now, where was i? let’s see. oh, yes. over here. you… what are you doing now?"
42392,Sheldon,why?
34201,Sheldon,i think this is the place.
34206,Sheldon,i want to leave.
34207,Sheldon,what’s the protocol for leaving?
34216,Sheldon,"two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
42416,Sheldon,"leonard, i assumed you knew. the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy, howard and bernadette, raj and his girlfriend, penny and chardonnay, penny and you."
34229,Sheldon,hi.
34236,Sheldon,"oh, come on. who hasn’t seen this differential below “here i sit broken hearted?”"
34237,Sheldon,"i didn’t invent them, they’re there."
34238,Sheldon,"in all of them, that is the point."
34239,Sheldon,"um, penny, that’s where i sit."
34242,Sheldon,"in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, i could go on, but i think i’ve made my point. "
42440,Sheldon,he makes a valid point.
34252,Sheldon,you’re lactose intolerant. 
42445,Sheldon,i go to the bathroom like everybody else.
34256,Sheldon,yes. 
42452,Sheldon,"i’ll give you a plan right now. step one, open comic book store. step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
34261,Sheldon,point taken. it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. 
34262,Sheldon,"so, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
42453,Sheldon,"so, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
42454,Sheldon,"nice. you mean, like at parks and schools?"
42456,Sheldon,"on the bright side, that oxford study was right. one friend down. i wonder who you’re going to lose next."
42460,Sheldon,"yes, but as a store owner, i’ll finally have a good comeback to, you don’t work here, shut up."
34270,Sheldon,i really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
42462,Sheldon,"because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list."
42463,Sheldon,if only penny had said that once in a while.
34275,Sheldon,no i don’t. and neither do you.
34276,Sheldon,"you did not break up with joyce kim, she defected to north korea."
34277,Sheldon,so we get to have a scene with him?
34283,Sheldon,it’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
34287,Sheldon,tell him about our iq.
34288,Sheldon,leonard.
42480,Sheldon,i’m not going to a cabin in the woods. did you see the movie cabin in the woods?
34290,Sheldon,you’re going to have to call her.
34291,Sheldon,"it’s okay. it wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
34292,Sheldon,well you got me out of my pants.
34296,Sheldon,"thank you. you’re not done with her, are you?"
42490,Sheldon,i’m sorry. is that a no?
34300,Sheldon,they would be gastronomically redundant. i can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
34301,Sheldon,"i don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable mack daddy."
42506,Sheldon,"well, i wonder if anyone’s tried that."
42511,Sheldon,"wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?"
42515,Sheldon,i think you mean positive punishment. negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. it’s a common mistake.
42518,Sheldon,but we didn’t see them bust one ghost.
34327,Sheldon,no.
34328,Sheldon,"excuse me, but i think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
42522,Sheldon,why not?
34332,Sheldon,"because it was immaculate, i mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
42524,Sheldon,i miss the old days when i couldn’t tell.
34334,Sheldon,nan
42529,Sheldon,yeah? we have to be somewhere.
34348,Sheldon,"i have to say, i slept splendidly. granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
34349,Sheldon,sarcasm?
42540,Sheldon,"uh, let’s see. 704? no, wait, it’s on clock. uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees."
42542,Sheldon,good. little claustrophobic.
34353,Sheldon,"do you want some cereal. i’m feeling so good today i’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. hello, honey puffs."
34356,Sheldon,"really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
34357,Sheldon,"and snoring. and that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. it’s a throat doctor."
34360,Sheldon,that wasn’t sarcasm?
34363,Sheldon,his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
34364,Sheldon,check.
34365,Sheldon,check.
34368,Sheldon,"run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. "
42560,Sheldon,we’re not stopping.
42566,Sheldon,it’s too late for koothrappali. let’s go.
34378,Sheldon,"wooh, i’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, i just built a virtual pool."
34380,Sheldon,penny for your thoughts. 
42573,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
34382,Sheldon,"well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
42579,Sheldon,why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? we can both play this game.
34388,Sheldon,"well, no."
42584,Sheldon,"oh, please, you know, i’ll tell you how he did it. implacable, relentless badgering. in urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. and she was a urethra that could not shake him."
34394,Sheldon,"leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
42592,Sheldon,"leonard, as your friend i feel i should tell you something."
34402,Sheldon,not if you’re a rugby team. 
34405,Sheldon,"of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
34406,Sheldon,"if i could of, i would of. "
34407,Sheldon,is the sex starting now?
42601,Sheldon, penny?
42606,Sheldon,there are post-prom mating rituals?
42608,Sheldon,"i may be an alien, but i have urges. if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, i will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. i’m not the best at reading facial cues, but i can see that you’re a little turned on."
34419,Sheldon,"so, how was your date?"
42613,Sheldon,"yes. i’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
34423,Sheldon,"yeah, it really takes the pressure off. "
34426,Sheldon,"at the last department party, dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
34427,Sheldon,"you know what’s interesting about caves, leonard?"
42619,Sheldon,excuse me.
42623,Sheldon,what’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. and there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what mr. bob eubanks called making whoopee.
34432,Sheldon,a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
42624,Sheldon,it’s not just that. leonard and penny also made comments about it. and i’m not blind. even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
34444,Sheldon,i need eggs. four dozen should suffice.
34448,Sheldon,theoretical physicists do not get canned. but yeah. 
34449,Sheldon,"no it doesn’t. not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. "
34453,Sheldon,"no, no. let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
42650,Sheldon,"remember when i said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
42652,Sheldon,"leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?"
34461,Sheldon,isn’t it?
34465,Sheldon,"are you sure. there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. for example, i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
34466,Sheldon,"well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
34472,Sheldon,"i read an article about japanese scientists, who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and i thought hey, fish nightlights."
34477,Sheldon,thank you.
34481,Sheldon,i went to the market with penny.
42673,Sheldon,"oh, stop it. i assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
42674,Sheldon,that’s for the fire marshal to determine.
42676,Sheldon,very well.
34487,Sheldon,"what do you want, mom?"
34489,Sheldon,what for?
42683,Sheldon,"well, i’m not making any promises. not only did leonard take what i feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
34492,Sheldon,why not?
34496,Sheldon,i got my job back.
34498,Sheldon,"thanks, mom. mom?"
34500,Sheldon,"alright, i’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings, we flank the tennessee volunteers, and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg."
42693,Sheldon,"oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. you still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. the minute you sneeze web, i’m moving out."
42694,Sheldon,"i was not panicked, and i am not overly attached to leonard."
34509,Sheldon,"he asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. "
34515,Sheldon,i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
34516,Sheldon,"semiotics. the study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
42710,Sheldon,i have no idea. because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock.
34519,Sheldon,what does it mean?
42714,Sheldon,no. this is. stop looking at my legs.
34526,Sheldon,"i don’t know what the protocol is here. do i stay, do i leave? do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? "
42718,Sheldon,"well, since you’re here, i’d like to get your opinion on something. in honour of black history month, i portrayed george washington carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. what do you think?  hi. my name is george."
42723,Sheldon,hello.
42727,Sheldon,"too bad your show is done. i kind of liked it. leonard, did you hear that? oh, the people are heartbroken. i can’t take this away from the world. fun with flags is back."
42729,Sheldon,"oh, no, i’m not going to drink it. i just wanted to hear the pop. yeah, i knew it was coming. still scary."
34538,Sheldon,"inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. "
42731,Sheldon,"you told me not to call, and i didn’t know how else to give you the good news. fun with flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
42737,Sheldon,"well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
42739,Sheldon,"because in the last ten minutes, santa came to town, kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer. i had a drunk uncle who did all those things. nobody sings songs about him."
34548,Sheldon,"i won’t go out on a limb, but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger. "
42745,Sheldon,i’m going to buy her a present.
34555,Sheldon,"you know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. "
42747,Sheldon,"yes. maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
34560,Sheldon,"the thing is, we’re not…."
34565,Sheldon,anime?
42757,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. which is why i got amy this."
42758,Sheldon,"oh, not just something, no. it’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and i swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
42761,Sheldon,but what about our agreement?
42762,Sheldon,cookies?
42763,Sheldon,they’re perfect. it tastes like her hugs.
34578,Sheldon,yes. it’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
34580,Sheldon,"i’m confused. if there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? "
42774,Sheldon,you know what you could make us do? ice-skating. the cold air will trigger leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a zamboni.
34583,Sheldon,"well, i actually might be able to help."
42775,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, leonard, i’m a problem-solver, it’s what i do."
42777,Sheldon,you should point out the hypocrisy of that.
42781,Sheldon,"well, once again, it’s what i do."
34590,Sheldon,"alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors i’m much more suited to being the guy from the faa, analysing wreckage. "
42785,Sheldon,"oh. well, that’s all right. there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
34599,Sheldon,"oh, snap. so i guess we’ll be leaving now. "
34601,Sheldon,"or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. "
42793,Sheldon,"oh, yes. i, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. did i say anything? no. i compromised and kept my mouth shut. like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you."
42794,Sheldon,"oh, i learned how. amy taught me."
34604,Sheldon,true. why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
42798,Sheldon,"well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown."
42804,Sheldon,i’m not upset. i’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
34615,Sheldon,tea. when people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. there there. you want to talk about it?
34616,Sheldon,good. there there was really all i had. 
34618,Sheldon,coming. 
42812,Sheldon,it’s not a basket. it’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century china.
42813,Sheldon,i saw that.
42820,Sheldon,"how could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
42826,Sheldon, penny?
34635,Sheldon,"okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
42833,Sheldon,"according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. so i’d like to ask you all to do something for me. keep me on my toes. just throw me off my game. essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
42835,Sheldon,done.
42836,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
42840,Sheldon,who eats them horizontally?
34660,Sheldon,"okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
34665,Sheldon,"no more talking, everybody go. "
42858,Sheldon,"well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. you know, who has the best cervix. which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
34682,Sheldon,"you can’t go out, it’s halo night. "
34683,Sheldon,you go dancing every wednesday.
42879,Sheldon,"i knew you’d understand, armadillo isaac newton."
34688,Sheldon,"it’s the chinese restaurant all over again. i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
42890,Sheldon,"well, you could have set newton’s gravitational constant to one. and, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. you know i can’t stand these scented markers."
34700,Sheldon,"the online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable id, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable id takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare. "
34704,Sheldon,"if i may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
34705,Sheldon,you seemed confused.
42901,Sheldon,"only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. i have it ready to go, but i wasn’t gonna do it without you."
34710,Sheldon,"understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
34713,Sheldon,"with certain obvious exceptions. suicide, for example. "
34715,Sheldon,fine. i’ll have a virgin cuba libre. 
34718,Sheldon,a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
42921,Sheldon,he still hasn’t responded. what’s taking him so long?
42930,Sheldon,he’s right. i say we call this person back. we’ve got no reason to hide.
42931,Sheldon,"click it with me. one, two, three, click."
34741,Sheldon,i could eat. 
34744,Sheldon,"oh. alright, noted. sorry."
42936,Sheldon,how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
42937,Sheldon,who cares? he stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
34750,Sheldon,"look at me, look at me, i’ve got goosebumps. "
42943,Sheldon,"oh, really? when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?"
42945,Sheldon,"i’m being petty? you know barry and i have a professional rivalry. you heard him, he told me to suck eggs. if we were friends, he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant. why are you laughing? did you learn something?"
42948,Sheldon,i’m mad at amy.
34759,Sheldon,"because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. which, if i were there, it would be. "
34760,Sheldon,"leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a nobel prize, is the day i begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. "
34761,Sheldon,"no we don’t. we have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. "
42953,Sheldon,"ugh, let it go. i have heard that my whole life. every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way i feel."
34764,Sheldon,it doesn’t need proving. 
42957,Sheldon,"oh, give me that. just out of curiosity, if i were to let something go, how would i do that?"
34767,Sheldon,if i’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is. 
34770,Sheldon,"penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that i’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. "
42962,Sheldon,okay.
34772,Sheldon,a little misunder…. galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding.
42969,Sheldon,"she’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. that’s when amy said, want to make this interesting?"
42974,Sheldon,i think i left my pen in there.
42975,Sheldon,i can’t. i’m naked.
34785,Sheldon,then why did you say it.
42981,Sheldon,but i think it would be comforting.
42983,Sheldon,"i didn’t care for her yelling. but now that i’m not going to hear it again, i’m sad."
34793,Sheldon,"you continue to underestimate me, my good man. "
34802,Sheldon,"oh we’ll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
43005,Sheldon,"uh, i wake up. uh, i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup. uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
43008,Sheldon,i don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
34817,Sheldon,you just lied to penny.
43009,Sheldon,i believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
43010,Sheldon,ha. keep dreaming.
34821,Sheldon, leonard…
43016,Sheldon,"so, it would be today? huh. well, i suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
43018,Sheldon,"well, i don’t enjoy presents. and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas director’s cut."
43020,Sheldon,thank you.
34835,Sheldon,"when we played chess earlier, you were terrific and i can’t wait to play you again. goodnight. "
43031,Sheldon,it was a monday afternoon. you joined us for indian food.
34841,Sheldon,"of course i do. my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder, colorado. it’s accurate to one tenth of a second. but as i’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
43036,Sheldon,"gary con, do we fly or drive? do we wear costumes? and if so, who gets to be gary?"
34846,Sheldon,to help you. 
34847,Sheldon,"she was going to see through your lie eventually, so i told her that you were lying to protect me. "
34848,Sheldon,"hunger? indigestion, i’m sorry i’m really not very good at this. anyway, penny now believes that on friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin leopold’s drug intervention. "
34849,Sheldon,"yea, who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee, remember that, it’s important. "
43038,Sheldon,"well, this is me. it’s been a very interesting evening."
34855,Sheldon,"no, of course not, there’s no cousin leo, there’s no intervention, focus leonard."
43051,Sheldon,"i know. i like him, too. hi, little guy. how’d you like to come home with us? you’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house."
34867,Sheldon,"no, that’s the least of our worries. i’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie. "
43063,Sheldon,what if i play the star trek theme on my nose?
34872,Sheldon,fine.  we’ll talk in the morning.
34873,Sheldon,"excuse me, we just went over this. as the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
43065,Sheldon,"i was going to make you red zinger, but since mars is the red planet, i went with peppermint."
34876,Sheldon,"well, you see, while leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
34879,Sheldon,"unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab. "
34881,Sheldon,don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
34883,Sheldon,"how could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. "
43080,Sheldon,"oh, look, it’s the scientific american that covered the paper leonard and i wrote."
43084,Sheldon,why? the theory he came up with just got mentioned in scientific american. he ought to be thrilled.
34894,Sheldon,"oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. "
34897,Sheldon,i’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. 
43091,Sheldon,"oh, that kid. poor leonard."
34900,Sheldon,we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment. and having never been to nebraska i’m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies. 
34904,Sheldon,"no, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
43097,Sheldon,an article was just published in scientific american about our theory.
34906,Sheldon,"oh, dear god.  leonard! leonard, i’m sick!"
43098,Sheldon,"no. no, they loved it. they, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it."
43111,Sheldon,well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill?
43117,Sheldon,is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
34927,Sheldon,can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
34928,Sheldon,then surprise me.  would you call that moss green or forest green? 
34929,Sheldon,thanks for bringing me home. 
43127,Sheldon,"leonard, please. his mother just died."
34936,Sheldon,"no. no, my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. "
34939,Sheldon,"well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. "
43133,Sheldon,"she said my name first, that must kill you."
43140,Sheldon,i don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell.
43150,Sheldon,"so they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
34960,Sheldon,"not bad, i myself started graduate school at fourteen."
43152,Sheldon,let me ask you this. do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
43153,Sheldon,"so it’s like the musical equivalent of russell’s paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?"
34966,Sheldon,"oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. goodbye. "
43160,Sheldon,"yes. oh, i’m so excited. and i just can’t hide it."
34971,Sheldon,get him out leonard.
34972,Sheldon,"yes, in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it. "
43168,Sheldon,"you pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
34977,Sheldon,"yes, but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. "
43170,Sheldon,"all right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
34982,Sheldon,"but, since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless, i just have to find something else to focus on."
34984,Sheldon,"what exactly is it you do? i know you chatter on about it all the time, but i’ve never really paid attention."
43177,Sheldon,"i can see the ranch, leonard. oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. i’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. i’m gonna make it. i’m gonna make it. they have tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… aaaaaaagh!"
34989,Sheldon,alright.
43182,Sheldon,"excuse me. leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
34991,Sheldon,"engineering. where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
43184,Sheldon,are you still mad at me?
34996,Sheldon,"now, i notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
43192,Sheldon,"it was. and even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the tasing. no, i got nothing."
43195,Sheldon,"i guess news travels fast. it’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman, and i wasn’t included."
35006,Sheldon,"we’ll make it nice, put out a spread. "
35012,Sheldon,youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
43205,Sheldon,"hey, look at that. even in your example, you’re all by yourself."
43206,Sheldon,"i can just picture them all right now at feynman’s house, probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing schrodinger. see? they’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
35016,Sheldon,you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? would you ask picasso to play pictionary? would you ask noah webster to play boggle? would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish? 
35017,Sheldon,"by that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition."
35024,Sheldon,he does. 
35026,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
35028,Sheldon,"but i answered, it’s called teamwork. "
35030,Sheldon,and of course it’s gravity probe b.
35034,Sheldon,"oh please, you don’t even have a phd. "
43230,Sheldon,"there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. j-a-m-e-s, c-l-e-r-k space m-a-x-w-e-l-l, and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o, a-m-e-s…"
35043,Sheldon,"okay, i don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because i’m on the team and i wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet. "
35044,Sheldon,why?
43236,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm."
43239,Sheldon,"i don’t recommend it. you’ll be doing it the rest of your life. anyway, if you’re looking for leonard, he’s with koothrappali."
35048,Sheldon,"it’s on, bitch. "
43240,Sheldon,"how nice. here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
43245,Sheldon,"no, that train has left the station. now, we can play this one of two ways. you can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and i’ll start."
43246,Sheldon,"so, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, i prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
35056,Sheldon,lamda equals one over pi r squared n 
43249,Sheldon,"all right, then. you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
35058,Sheldon,"hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. what are you doing?"
35060,Sheldon,"well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, i answer the questions."
35061,Sheldon,"hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia, but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist. . ow!"
43256,Sheldon,"well, well, well, did you hear that, howard?"
35065,Sheldon,informal protest.
43257,Sheldon,certainly.
43259,Sheldon,tonight works better for me.
35068,Sheldon,i don’t understand the question. 
35071,Sheldon,who?
35072,Sheldon,alright that is very immature.
43263,Sheldon,"you’re out, and you’re out. i win. who wants pizza?"
43265,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be offended. you know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
35077,Sheldon,"well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
35081,Sheldon,there’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
43274,Sheldon,aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
35083,Sheldon,need you ask? but i still don’t understand why no-one else bid. 
35084,Sheldon,i understand why no-one else bid. 
35085,Sheldon,"in a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
43276,Sheldon,fine. i wonder if they make i told you so cards in braille.
43277,Sheldon,and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
43282,Sheldon,you see where i’m going with this.
35093,Sheldon,"the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor from victorian england into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling eloy. "
35101,Sheldon,"oh, i have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
35102,Sheldon,"if i remember correctly, captain kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stardate 5027.3, which will be january 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
35103,Sheldon,time machine. 
35109,Sheldon,"same paradox. if you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. "
35110,Sheldon,it won’t change the past. 
35111,Sheldon,are you upset about something? 
35112,Sheldon,"well, it was a number of things. first the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
35113,Sheldon,oh! i don’t usually pick up on those things. good for me. 
43302,Sheldon,"oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
43303,Sheldon,whoa.
43307,Sheldon,that’s what my train used to do.
35117,Sheldon,"in addition, your premise is flawed. in the original film, rod taylor got yvette mimeaux with that very time machine. in back to the future, marty mcfly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. "
43312,Sheldon,"don’t worry, everyone in here is safe."
35122,Sheldon,my spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with penny. 
43315,Sheldon,"maybe they’ll be best friends. one of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. sound familiar?"
43317,Sheldon,"oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. it describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
43318,Sheldon,"what did they feed the lions, mother?"
35130,Sheldon,"it worked. it really worked. they said i was mad, but it worked.  "
43324,Sheldon,"beverly, would you like to see the math i worked out to support our hypothesis?"
43327,Sheldon,tell her about the uranium. tell her about the uranium.
43330,Sheldon,"oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
35141,Sheldon,"the papers could have been mailed, mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
43335,Sheldon,"oh, sure."
35152,Sheldon,i’m not ignoring my sister. i’m ignoring all of you. 
43345,Sheldon,while my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
35154,Sheldon,"i guess. don’t worry, i was going to order you cheeseless."
43350,Sheldon,"yes. i thought, i can’t decide if i should watch the flash tv show. i know, i’ll ask amy. anyway."
35160,Sheldon,why?
43355,Sheldon,"oh, good. you’re here. i need your assistance."
43356,Sheldon,what happened?
35166,Sheldon,"you’re out too, by the way."
43358,Sheldon,"amy’s mad at me, and i’m not clear why."
35168,Sheldon,"now that leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. "
43366,Sheldon,"if that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
43367,Sheldon,"no, and i’m confused. it’s been nearly 24 hours. amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now."
43369,Sheldon,that’s right. it’s called foreplay. and i could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
43371,Sheldon,"but you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date."
43373,Sheldon,okay. if you say so.
43380,Sheldon,i’m sorry i’ve upset you. i shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
35189,Sheldon,i’m a theoretical physicist.
43382,Sheldon,"ah, well, very well. so does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?"
35191,Sheldon,"my god! why don’t you just tell them i’m a toll taker at the golden gate bridge? rocket scientist, how humiliating. "
43385,Sheldon,"my aunt and uncle were married 63 years. towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
43388,Sheldon,"hello. listen, i’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and i think…"
43392,Sheldon,"well, gollum, you’re an expert on rings. what do i do with this one?"
43393,Sheldon,"leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
35204,Sheldon,in addition i really don’t think that leonard wants a…
43398,Sheldon,"no, of course not. they thrive on our suffering."
35209,Sheldon,"possibly, but unverified."
43403,Sheldon,amy’s upset? is it about me?
35212,Sheldon,the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
35213,Sheldon,"let’s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because i have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. now i can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. and i ask you, is it worth it? "
35220,Sheldon,"okay, i see, so not a dvd burner."
43412,Sheldon,"oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? that’s sad."
35222,Sheldon,what do you think.
43417,Sheldon,"raj, you’re probably wondering why amy and i aren’t showing any affection to one another."
43420,Sheldon,"i see what’s happening. sides are forming. well, if bernadette’s on amy’s team, i pick howard."
35229,Sheldon,what twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? 
35232,Sheldon,"yeah, i suppose. "
43431,Sheldon,wasn’t mary magdalene a woman of ill repute?
35241,Sheldon,"yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. "
43435,Sheldon,"yeah. i know. turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. i blame madonna."
43436,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry about leonard. thought i raised him better than that."
35246,Sheldon,why?
43438,Sheldon,mandy chao?
43439,Sheldon,"oh, you don’t need to worry about her. she’s brilliant and attractive. she can do way better"
35251,Sheldon,"not surprising. penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex. the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk. "
43450,Sheldon,and you know why? ‘cause you’re a man. the champagne of genders.
35259,Sheldon,a second what? pair of underwear? 
43454,Sheldon,why are you up?
35263,Sheldon,we’re not done? 
35264,Sheldon,"ach, why not? we’re already through the looking glass anyway. "
35265,Sheldon,"well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia. "
43457,Sheldon,"glad you asked. as i see it, there’s a simple solution. your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. it seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. and by dally, i mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
43459,Sheldon,i will tell you what is happening. i am saving my best friend’s marriage.
35273,Sheldon,"i would not say that. no-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. "
43471,Sheldon,you wore it the night we went ice-skating. remember?
43473,Sheldon,"it’s not yours? oh, my. how embarrassing for both of us."
35283,Sheldon,"i can see that. unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
43476,Sheldon,"oh, of course. wouldn’t want to intrude. this is yours."
43478,Sheldon,"now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as i see it, there’s a simple solution."
35287,Sheldon,i assumed you would. 
35291,Sheldon,"alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
35292,Sheldon,schrodinger’s cat.
35298,Sheldon,"oh, hi penny. fyi, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so i’d avoid using that for your delicates. "
43492,Sheldon,she was listening through the door. she wants me.
35301,Sheldon,well i assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? because i’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
35303,Sheldon,"well, for one thing, she was french. for another, it was literature. "
43495,Sheldon,"well, that was fun. good for you, leonard."
43498,Sheldon,"oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?"
43500,Sheldon,it’s bad enough i’m being taken against my will. i don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
35309,Sheldon,you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
43502,Sheldon,no.
43505,Sheldon,"uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside."
35317,Sheldon,"i.e, i couldn’t become green lantern unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, i could be batman."
35318,Sheldon,sure.  i’m batman. see.
35319,Sheldon,"why are you asking me, i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me, nor do i have any method of learning such things.  "
35320,Sheldon,nothing. you seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists.
43509,Sheldon,are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
35322,Sheldon,well i might ask you the same question. why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? but exist between you and penny. a person to whom i barely speak.  
43511,Sheldon,it is extraordinary.
43512,Sheldon,"i usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. however, even i must admit feeling richard feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
35327,Sheldon,forget! you want me to forget? this mind does not forget. i haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. it was a drizzly tuesday.
35328,Sheldon,there doesn’t have to be a reason. 
43520,Sheldon,"ooh, the green lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
43529,Sheldon,we blew up feynman’s van.
43530,Sheldon,"what a wonderful day, thank you."
43532,Sheldon,"age is a state of mind, leonard. in here i’m 90. why are you taking your bins over there?"
35343,Sheldon,i’ve never slept on an air mattress before. no lumbar support whatsoever. 
43537,Sheldon,thank you for letting me come speak with you.
43538,Sheldon,"as my relationships with penny and amy are currently strained, i’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
35347,Sheldon,meh. that poster of halle berry’s a little unnerving. 
35357,Sheldon,i promised penny. 
43549,Sheldon,it says here you’re a chemist. which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
43550,Sheldon,looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
43552,Sheldon,"i was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then i realized what i want to ask you is why is there a band-aid on your forearm, but then i realized what i really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
35363,Sheldon,i drank milk that tasted funny. 
43559,Sheldon,"no, just because i’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean i’m delusional. and since it is 2003, i don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before i call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
43561,Sheldon,"in my present, it’s in the future. in your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man i met in the home depot parking lot."
35371,Sheldon,you’re wearing modern underwear?
35376,Sheldon,"her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
43568,Sheldon,"you can. i’m happy when you come home. and i’m scared of fireworks. by the way, on july fourth, we’re all sleeping here."
35380,Sheldon,"hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
35386,Sheldon,"oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
43579,Sheldon,"technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. swash referring to the sound of the sword. swash. and then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have."
43581,Sheldon,"oh, dear."
35390,Sheldon,you mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
35391,Sheldon,"well, why should i leave, this is my apartment too."
43582,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure i have a dominant leg. they’re both pretty submissive."
43588,Sheldon,i’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
43589,Sheldon,"you know, when my honour is insulted, and i need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
43591,Sheldon,"ah, this is fun."
35401,Sheldon,i don’t like bearclaws.
43593,Sheldon,good to know? what’s that supposed to mean?
43595,Sheldon,"yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb."
35411,Sheldon,"it’s not hard. it’s simple. you can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
43607,Sheldon,"excuse me. i’m recovering from a recent breakup, and i’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. and as ash ketchum said to pikachu, i choose you."
35417,Sheldon,"yes, the doctor doom to my mr fantastic. the doctor octopus to my spiderman. the doctor sivana to my captain marvel."
43609,Sheldon,"well, we gave it a shot. how about you?"
35419,Sheldon,"leslie winkle, penny. she belittles my research."
43610,Sheldon,"ah, what might have been. and you, give my regards to barnum and bailey."
43611,Sheldon,i smell funny. i taste salty.
43616,Sheldon,it was pretty easy. and i think my background in mathletics helped. barry kripke was there. i should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
35425,Sheldon,you continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
35428,Sheldon,"oh mario. if only i could control everyone the way i control you. hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
43620,Sheldon,thanks. and i taste good too.
35431,Sheldon,"i’m listening, amuse me."
35435,Sheldon,only nine more months to comic-con.
35436,Sheldon,"captain, i’m getting an unusual reading."
43628,Sheldon,did you know that i almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
43630,Sheldon,not a chance.
35442,Sheldon,"well that’s not surprising. that baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
43634,Sheldon,where does he work?
35446,Sheldon,"i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. but returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
43639,Sheldon,that’s right. and what did he do?
35452,Sheldon,the conqueror.
43647,Sheldon,i can’t find that quote on the internet. did you make that up?
43657,Sheldon,"not necessarily. uh, many argue the essence of a mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
35467,Sheldon,"well, have you been to the temple of mithra?"
43661,Sheldon,i told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
43662,Sheldon,space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
43663,Sheldon,"and i’m sorry i lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. although i am currently single, if you know anybody."
35474,Sheldon,people can’t be in my bedroom.
35475,Sheldon,i’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
43667,Sheldon,she said buenas noches. what was he supposed to do?
43671,Sheldon,"well, did you see this sticker?"
35484,Sheldon,"god, no."
35485,Sheldon,"oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. dr gablehauser, i have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. all she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
43679,Sheldon,"well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. that’s all i’ve got on me."
43682,Sheldon,"it scared me straight, leonard."
35492,Sheldon,"danger, danger."
35494,Sheldon,she comes into my room. no-one’s supposed to be in my room.
35495,Sheldon,"hang on, leonard, while i have no respect for leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
35499,Sheldon,zip it pip it. can i have your phone number?
43692,Sheldon,"oh, it’s nice to meet you. i admire your father’s work very much. it’s not every day i get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum."
35502,Sheldon,"i must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
35509,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
43704,Sheldon,"no offence, but this is pure 100% nimoy. because of your mother, you’re only 50%. which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
43705,Sheldon,wouldn’t you like to know?
35520,Sheldon,"but wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
43715,Sheldon,"oh, no, he broke my collarbone. i can still hear it click."
43716,Sheldon,"oh, not at all. as i said, the entire point of emulating spock was to rise above human emotion, which i’ve spent a lifetime mastering."
43717,Sheldon,excuse me?
43720,Sheldon,"because when i speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that i’ve put this amy nonsense behind me."
35529,Sheldon,"in general, yes."
43721,Sheldon,hello.
35531,Sheldon,"here, look, look, i found my missing neutrino."
43725,Sheldon,"well, this is ridiculous. being upset about amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. if i want to resolve this situation, then i need to take action."
35535,Sheldon,"how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? when i was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
43732,Sheldon,"i realized something. when amy was in my life, i was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
35542,Sheldon,"oh, sorry. "
43739,Sheldon,gentlemen.
43751,Sheldon,"golly, she sounds too good to be true."
43756,Sheldon,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. you know, probably half that if i break out the old cow eyes."
43757,Sheldon,uh-oh. what if it’s jennifer lawrence?
35566,Sheldon,"while others mourned lucky, i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
43759,Sheldon,"oh, fine, i won’t shut my heart to the love of jennifer lawrence."
43761,Sheldon,all right. can i help you?
35572,Sheldon,"uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. they could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and i’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
35573,Sheldon,he should share our love of technology.
43769,Sheldon,"well, i’m calling because thanksgiving is coming up, and i wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
43770,Sheldon,"no. they’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year i finally touch a starfish. anyway, i wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like."
43774,Sheldon,"oh, and forget what i said about the myanmar catfish. my list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
43775,Sheldon,and there goes my list.
43780,Sheldon,mm. your aunt in modesto?
35589,Sheldon,penny. didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends?
43783,Sheldon,"i don’t know if i’d call it discussing. you kind of sat back and let me do all the work. let’s see, what’s next on the list. oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
35592,Sheldon,thank you for driving me to work.
43787,Sheldon,all right.
43788,Sheldon,just a few.
35597,Sheldon,is there a “check the check engine light light”?  o-o-o-oh!
43789,Sheldon,how many dates have you been on? who were they with? where’d you go? where did you meet them? did you sleep with them? and how much longer to the aquarium? i’m getting kind of hungry.
35599,Sheldon,of course not.
43799,Sheldon,"well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
35608,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, there you are, i’m ready to go home."
35609,Sheldon,"good, perfect timing."
35611,Sheldon,"now, how do you propose i get home?"
43804,Sheldon,"i know. it makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down."
35620,Sheldon,"she’s in my spot. don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
35625,Sheldon,and radio shack.
35629,Sheldon,examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
43828,Sheldon,"bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. this song is never going to stop. have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
43835,Sheldon,it’s about amy.
35645,Sheldon,i haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
35647,Sheldon,what if a simulated van rear-ends me?
35648,Sheldon,thank you.
43839,Sheldon,"i don’t care. amy, there was a song i couldn’t get out of my head. eventually, i realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, i can’t get you out of my heart. so, what i’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. the metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
43840,Sheldon,"i’m, i’m sorry; i didn’t realize you were on a date."
43841,Sheldon,"amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, i really want to be your boyfriend."
43844,Sheldon,what?
43849,Sheldon,"hey, thursday can’t get here soon enough. i’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while i eat enough star wars cereal to choke a wookiee."
43852,Sheldon,"arthur, what brings you back?"
35667,Sheldon,"amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
43862,Sheldon,"see, i, i had tickets to the star wars premiere that night, but professor proton came to me in a dream dressed as obi-wan kenobi and convinced me i should be with you."
43863,Sheldon,"i’ll, i’ll let you get back to sleep now. good night."
43867,Sheldon, penny.
35676,Sheldon,yes. apparently i’m getting a free dinner.
35690,Sheldon,"oh, yes, it’s halo night. let me just dry my tootsies."
43885,Sheldon,"this is an important night for us, and i’m worried i might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
35695,Sheldon,i prefer to think of it as i’m pulling them forward.
43887,Sheldon,"oh, sure. well, you’re fun to look at."
35697,Sheldon,he does want that. does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
43891,Sheldon,"okay. ooh, this is different, hmm? candles and music."
43895,Sheldon,oh. all right. um. i should probably tell you something about this gift.
35704,Sheldon,i formally request sanctuary.
43900,Sheldon,hello.
43903,Sheldon,why?
35712,Sheldon,"never, that’s the problem. i need your help."
43905,Sheldon,"well, i enjoyed that more than i thought i would."
43907,Sheldon,"arthur. what are you doing here? i, i don’t think i need any more advice."
35718,Sheldon,godzilla clause?
43910,Sheldon,i’m glad to see you made it safely. how’s your hotel?
43913,Sheldon,all right. enjoy the neurobiology conference.
35728,Sheldon,"yes, i’m getting a free pizza. i’m on a roll."
35729,Sheldon,"more pad thai, please."
35730,Sheldon,just one more bite.
35731,Sheldon,i’m just so… full.
43920,Sheldon,"uh, stop selling it, kid. you won."
43923,Sheldon,kind of a wuss.
35734,Sheldon,what’s wrong with your tv?
43924,Sheldon,still hasn’t bought milk even though i told him two days ago.
35736,Sheldon,…playing klingon boggle.
43925,Sheldon,what are you doing?
35738,Sheldon,"all right, boggle warriors, kapla’!"
43926,Sheldon,hmm. what are you doing now?
43931,Sheldon,"but, look, an optical transient."
43932,Sheldon,"it wasn’t difficult. you know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?"
35742,Sheldon,is my hamburger medium well?
35744,Sheldon,individual relish packets?
35745,Sheldon,onion rings?
35746,Sheldon,extra breading?
43938,Sheldon,that’s it? how common. that’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
35755,Sheldon,who touched my…
43951,Sheldon,"all right, way to go, cat poster. you hang in there."
43952,Sheldon,"it’s perfect. it appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of valentine’s day forever."
43957,Sheldon,"well, it took a little negotiating, but i wore him down. uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and i have children, they all have to be named rajesh."
43958,Sheldon,even the girls.
43962,Sheldon,i’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
35774,Sheldon,oh! hello.
35790,Sheldon,who is it?
35796,Sheldon,just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
35798,Sheldon,how is deep space nine better than saturn 3?
43992,Sheldon,"fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
35801,Sheldon,"it’s very simple. look, scissors cuts paper. paper covers rock. rock crushes lizard. lizard poisons spock. spock smashes scissors. scissors decapitates lizard. lizard eats paper. paper disproves spock. spock vaporizes rock. and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
35811,Sheldon,"all right, will you at least stipulate that star trek iv: the voyage home is inarguably the best?"
35812,Sheldon,where?
44007,Sheldon,"all right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. and to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative t-shirts."
35817,Sheldon,i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion.
35818,Sheldon,plus i understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
35819,Sheldon,snap what?
44009,Sheldon,i’m afraid it can’t. the trip is tomorrow. and i have more apologies to make.
44011,Sheldon,"you brought me my comic books when i wasn’t feeling well. that, that was thoughtful. and i was insensitive. i’m sorry."
44016,Sheldon,"and, emily, i’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. and i’m sure you’re tired of hearing that."
44017,Sheldon,"well, i would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting botox into old lady faces…"
35828,Sheldon,"if someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should i say?"
44024,Sheldon,"that is true. well, i suppose i should apologize again."
44025,Sheldon,"well, that is fine, because i’ve decided that i won’t be joining you. i’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse i feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
44026,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been on a little trip myself recently. not to sin city but to sincere city. where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth."
44030,Sheldon,"emily, as i’m sure you know, i’m considered an odd fellow. but what you don’t know is that, while i often say the wrong thing, in my heart i mean well. i think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? and we all think that you can do better than koothrappali."
44035,Sheldon,"that’s me. bye, stuart."
35844,Sheldon,"it’s colloquial, a conversation opener. so, do you find the weather satisfying? are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
44036,Sheldon,are you relieved that you and raj were able to patch things up?
44044,Sheldon,"and that’s not helpful. you know, i got her an iphone for christmas. i’ll see where she is."
35853,Sheldon,"anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
35858,Sheldon,"well, this is very pleasant."
35863,Sheldon,good. what’s your favourite fruit?
35866,Sheldon,"i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. when i was 12, i got to ride there in a helicopter."
44058,Sheldon,"a texas special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. thank you, meemaw."
44060,Sheldon,"here you go, meemaw. i made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
35869,Sheldon,"excuse me. when i come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
35870,Sheldon,"i do. do you? because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since i sat down."
44063,Sheldon,yeah.
35877,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, this is it."
35881,Sheldon,"i’m afraid i can’t allow that. pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a, you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command."
44073,Sheldon,no. they asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
44077,Sheldon,"meemaw, look, i’m sorry, but i have to defend my girlfriend to you."
44078,Sheldon,"oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. i always looked up to you and pop-pop. i, i know what a challenging man he could be, but i saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
44081,Sheldon,yes.
35893,Sheldon,"more to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together."
44085,Sheldon,"if any of you are looking for something to do on valentine’s day, amy and i’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of fun with flags. you’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."
44087,Sheldon,"you know, uh, once i ordered an uber by accident. i just got in and went somewhere."
44088,Sheldon,i’m nervous. i hope people will be around to watch even though it’s valentine’s day.
35907,Sheldon,"go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
44101,Sheldon,"and actually, it was three different men."
35910,Sheldon,"fyi, i was defrosting a steak in there."
44102,Sheldon,"well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. the flag of the isle of man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
35913,Sheldon,watery?
35916,Sheldon,"well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. i just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
35919,Sheldon,in which i am not an expert.
44111,Sheldon,"i’m glad you asked. amy, you have a confetto in your nose. no, no, no, no. other side. there you go."
35923,Sheldon,then it must be a tumour.
35925,Sheldon,"it’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
35926,Sheldon,how is it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c? is that imaginary? i don’t think so.
44118,Sheldon,"oh, really? okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
35929,Sheldon,"that being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
35937,Sheldon,see? she’s not offended. and now you finally have an answer.
44131,Sheldon,"this video. the baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
35942,Sheldon,"oh, she is. she’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
44136,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. and if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
35945,Sheldon,hang on. 130 over 80. a little high. we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
44137,Sheldon,"wonderful. i’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. if i knew what that meant, i might just do it."
44138,Sheldon,"a microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? you bet i am."
35948,Sheldon,i understand. all i need is for you to authorize these tests.
35951,Sheldon,wha??
35952,Sheldon,i knew it! what do i do?
35953,Sheldon,for how…
35954,Sheldon,"your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. it is well established superman cleans his uniform by flying into earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
44148,Sheldon,"when i was six, they told me batman was coming to my party. i waited by the door for hours. closest thing to batman i saw was when a robin flew into the window."
44150,Sheldon,"very well. you may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. but then you owe me big-time."
35961,Sheldon,there are no do-overs in wii bowling.
35962,Sheldon,where were you that’s more important than wii bowling night?
44155,Sheldon,but who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
35966,Sheldon,"no, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia."
44158,Sheldon,i am. oh. wait.
44161,Sheldon,"uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. beverly. wil wheaton. adam west, for some reason."
35972,Sheldon,"no, it’s too late. i see it. that elf sticker says to sheldon. the die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, hannibal has crossed the alps."
44165,Sheldon,i know that you worked hard to put this together. i’m sorry i’m ruining it.
44167,Sheldon,"based on this pep talk, i’d say you’re still doing it."
35976,Sheldon,"i told you before, bears are terrifying."
35979,Sheldon,you put no thought into that.
35981,Sheldon,"if i were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
44173,Sheldon,"that’s how you do it, wolowitz. now you see why he’s famous and you’re not."
44177,Sheldon,thank you.
44178,Sheldon,"thank you. that, that was wonderful."
44184,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you’re an engineer. end of joke, burn."
35994,Sheldon,is it wrong to say i love our killer robot?
35996,Sheldon,what did the toaster oven ever do to you?
35997,Sheldon,"yeah, this is an auspicious moment. yeah, like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
36002,Sheldon,"leonard, i believe it is. this is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. also, i’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
44196,Sheldon,so stipulated.
44199,Sheldon,excuse me. i’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. don’t need one now.
44201,Sheldon,"if she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd."
36010,Sheldon,you are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify monte so that he’s prepared.
44208,Sheldon,"oh, please. any contract i sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
36017,Sheldon,do it.
36018,Sheldon,indeed. we are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  that’s new.
36022,Sheldon,"you’re right. monte’s gone. we’ll bury him in the morning. a simple ceremony. i’ll speak. leonard, you’ll play your cello."
44214,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve always valued education over money. and the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive i’ve been of your contributions."
44216,Sheldon,what? i didn’t sign it yet.
36027,Sheldon,"it is also indigenous to brazil, as is the cocoa bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. and you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
36029,Sheldon,"well then, the solution is simple. i shall befriend him. kripke!"
44224,Sheldon,what?  hello?
36035,Sheldon,"it’s a questionnaire i devised. i’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so i’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
36038,Sheldon,"only 211. don’t worry, in deference to you, i’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
36040,Sheldon,well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. may i suggest it as the topic for your essay.
44233,Sheldon,"yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
36044,Sheldon,"there are a number of acceptable answers, for example, c: near earth transport, but certainly not b: avocado rancher. and your essay, suggesting that i’d have better luck making friends if i wait ’til the cylons take over? please."
36045,Sheldon,"yes, well it’s better than what wolowitz did. he drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
36046,Sheldon,what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
44238,Sheldon,but you only have two eyes. you got a lot of nostril hairs.
36050,Sheldon,the skills are transferrable. i just have no interest in going in the water.
44245,Sheldon,we’d have to take your car.
36058,Sheldon,i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
44254,Sheldon,i have a ziploc bag filled with all my old ziploc bags.
36064,Sheldon,"hi rebecca, i’m your new friend, sheldon."
44258,Sheldon,"i’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time i think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and i get butterflies in my stomach. and then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…"
36069,Sheldon,"mmhmm. mmhmm. it’s interesting. but isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? yeah? tell me another interest of yours. hmmm. is there any chance you like monkeys? what is wrong with you? everybody likes monkeys. hang on, kripke.  a loop counter? and an escape to the least objectionable activity! howard, that’s brilliant! i’m surprised you saw that."
44263,Sheldon,i have an old teddy bear i secretly wiped my nose on for years.
36074,Sheldon,"little kid hominids, perhaps.  is this your entire job? your parents must be so proud."
44268,Sheldon,i will always have the dent to remember it by.
36081,Sheldon,"well, it’s not exactly a plan but i think i’m going to pass out."
36085,Sheldon,"maintaining five friendships promises to be a herculean task. so, i’m going to have to let one of you go."
36087,Sheldon,"don’t be silly. howard, you do not have a phd, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays."
36088,Sheldon,"no. you, too, are safe."
44284,Sheldon,oh. do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
36098,Sheldon,they have twizzlers instead of red vines. no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
36109,Sheldon,hang on a moment.  here. take some. pay me back when you can.
44306,Sheldon,"no, i crossed in the middle of the street. and normally, i wouldn’t, but i saw an aggressive-looking girl scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
44311,Sheldon,i’m calling it. i won.
44312,Sheldon,"oh, never have i ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
44316,Sheldon,"i have a question about batman. batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. now, if man-bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be man-batman?"
36128,Sheldon,all right.
44324,Sheldon,you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
44328,Sheldon,"oh, fine. we don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to."
36137,Sheldon,"leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
36139,Sheldon,"all right. leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? say hi to kurt for us."
36141,Sheldon,"they had a terrible time of it, leonard."
44334,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. theon greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
36149,Sheldon,darn. i can’t seem to get the hang of that.
44349,Sheldon,"well, i’ll catch you up. uh, penny is angry at leonard, leonard’s angry at me and penny, i’m angry at leonard and amy, raj is angry at howard, and i’m angry at george r.r. martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for leonard."
36158,Sheldon,the frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
44351,Sheldon,i didn’t say fun fact. i’m not a monster.
36160,Sheldon,what a remarkable woman.
36161,Sheldon,i envy you your childhood.
44353,Sheldon,cersei uses her body to manipulate men. penny just takes me to the lego store.
36164,Sheldon,"leonard, i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
44357,Sheldon, leonard.
44367,Sheldon,"oh, come on. roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, i’ve been avoiding these things all my life. and now, because you’re pregnant, you have to."
44369,Sheldon,"oh, but i won’t be there."
44370,Sheldon,"you know, it’s like how i play warlords of ka’a with you and elder sign with frank and alicia."
36185,Sheldon,"because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. on three. one, two, three, go!"
44377,Sheldon,"oh, no bubble baths either. they can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
36187,Sheldon,"based on your academic record, any number of things, i would imagine."
44379,Sheldon,"oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
44383,Sheldon,you’ve heard of french toast?
44386,Sheldon,you get where i’m going here?
44390,Sheldon,"well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
44391,Sheldon,"and last but not least, this is one that i like to call star wars toast because it has a light side and a dark side. all righty, it’s time for dungeons & dragons."
36200,Sheldon,koothrappali picked me up.
36201,Sheldon,they don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
44393,Sheldon,"oh, i have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
44395,Sheldon,"your name is bernatrix. you are a warrior queen. you’re strong, beautiful and tall."
36209,Sheldon,"focus is important. was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
36210,Sheldon,this is my spot. where else am i supposed to crouch?
44403,Sheldon,"using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. you slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. as you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. the end."
44404,Sheldon,"oh, the fun doesn’t stop. you’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
36217,Sheldon,what? wh-where did my cashew chicken come from?
44409,Sheldon,"oh, i overdid it myself last night. hair of the dog."
44410,Sheldon,of course.
36220,Sheldon,what’s real? what isn’t? how can i know?
36224,Sheldon,that was for my cushion.
44419,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, who is mike drop?"
36228,Sheldon,"stop. we can’t do this, it’s not right."
44423,Sheldon,"oh, easy, bill nye the science guy."
36239,Sheldon,"socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
44432,Sheldon,"i don’t understand. you were happy to do this when i hired you. why, why are you upset with me now?"
36242,Sheldon,no.
44437,Sheldon,"i suppose so. but if i get out of the line, i’ll lose my spot."
44438,Sheldon,you would do that?
44439,Sheldon,you’re a good man.
36251,Sheldon,yes.
44443,Sheldon,i’m back.
44444,Sheldon,"it went well. yeah, i’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. uh, stuart, i relieve you of your line duties."
44446,Sheldon,"no, it’s not fine. it is a breach of line etiquette."
44448,Sheldon,what if each of those people let someone cut?
36260,Sheldon,"oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
44452,Sheldon,"well, no. it’s not cool. if there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. but this line is first-come, first-served. not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. right here."
44458,Sheldon,"well, what a sad state of affairs. that you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you."
44461,Sheldon,i most certainly did not.
36274,Sheldon,"no! leonard, let me tell you something. personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
36276,Sheldon,"yes, i’m still here. where am i going? i’m on a train. now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. hoberman’s sphere. it’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. no, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
36277,Sheldon,that’s the wrong box. put it back.
44468,Sheldon,"because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
44469,Sheldon,"oh, you’re welcome."
44472,Sheldon,"well, actually, i…"
44473,Sheldon,"excuse me, i take care of him."
36282,Sheldon,"you’re holding a japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. first, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. you’ll hear a slight click."
44474,Sheldon,"yeah, and leonard’s mother’s already here."
36284,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the usb port. she calls me moon pie because i’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the usb port. the one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
44480,Sheldon,mom.
44484,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. they’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
36300,Sheldon,but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights?
36303,Sheldon,i think you’re just making that up.
44498,Sheldon,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
36311,Sheldon,i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. good luck.
36315,Sheldon,and you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while i’m doing so.
36320,Sheldon,there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you.
36325,Sheldon,"you’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. no. the moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in 1908. that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. i guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your radiohead."
36326,Sheldon,i assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. it’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
44518,Sheldon,"well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. i mean, look at us. we took things remarkably slow. you and i, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
44522,Sheldon,"yeah, excuse me, i need to say something to someone pretty special, and i just can’t wait any longer."
36331,Sheldon,"hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. i’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
44524,Sheldon,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
36341,Sheldon,brilliant. men love bluetooth.
44540,Sheldon,hello.
36349,Sheldon,"penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. observe. hey! less talk, more work!"
44541,Sheldon,"don’t sign anything? that’s your advice? okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
36351,Sheldon,"no, i don’t drink coffee."
44542,Sheldon,that’s what you said.
44545,Sheldon,you don’t need him. i’ll represent you.
44546,Sheldon,i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting.
36357,Sheldon,"no problem. i’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
36362,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
36364,Sheldon,"no, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. they say it is, but it’s not."
36366,Sheldon,you can’t know that. how can you possibly know that?
44561,Sheldon,i never realized this building was classified.
36372,Sheldon,so? do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
36373,Sheldon,hello.
44565,Sheldon,"oh, while you do that i am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts."
44568,Sheldon,how late?
36378,Sheldon,"hang on. are you now or have you ever been a salsa, irish folk or break-dancer?"
36379,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry. well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. next question, are you fertile?"
44571,Sheldon,and look how irritable it’s making you!
44572,Sheldon,fine.  i don’t think i can go much longer.
36384,Sheldon,"alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. she’s still on probation, of course, but i like her."
44577,Sheldon,"huh, what?"
44582,Sheldon,"the first one’s free? flash, how do you stay in business?"
36403,Sheldon,you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
44595,Sheldon,i do.
44597,Sheldon,with what?
36406,Sheldon,"they’re gone, penny. they can’t hear you."
44604,Sheldon,"no, i can’t figure out the math. i’ve been racking my brain for days, and i’ve got nothing."
36415,Sheldon,"well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of anything can happen thursday."
36416,Sheldon,"rut? i think you mean consistency. and if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it thursday? let’s call it quonko day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra."
44607,Sheldon,"he said start with it, not end with it."
44608,Sheldon,the computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
44618,Sheldon,"interesting. if my official residence were across the hall, i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here."
36427,Sheldon,"yeah, provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the dc multiverse."
44620,Sheldon,"you’re darn right, you wouldn’t. no matter where i am, this will always be my spot. like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
44622,Sheldon,yes. i accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
36431,Sheldon,i need it for my robin collection.
36433,Sheldon,"no, you!"
36434,Sheldon,"yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
44625,Sheldon,"of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys. one pair that was neither dating nor living together. one pair that was dating but not living together. one pair that was living together but not dating. and then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. although, with that many sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
44626,Sheldon,"well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. i would like this experiment to go well. are there any insights you can share?"
36437,Sheldon,"so, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday?"
36440,Sheldon,all right. then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening?
36441,Sheldon,"a moment ago, when you turned off the tv in the middle of }during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode. would you like some advice?"
36442,Sheldon,"then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
36445,Sheldon,my original point.
36448,Sheldon,"oh, good, stuart, i thought i heard your voice. do you have a moment?"
36452,Sheldon,"i am asserting, in the event that batman’s death proves permanent, that original robin, dick grayson, is the logical successor to the bat cowl."
44647,Sheldon,"like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
44648,Sheldon,"fine. okay. now, on this side, i am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
36458,Sheldon,i am forgetting nothing and i resent your tone.
44650,Sheldon,"ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
44651,Sheldon,"now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
44652,Sheldon,i suppose that works.
44655,Sheldon,"oh, i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
44657,Sheldon,"okay, well, i am sorry. i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. and no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
36466,Sheldon,"i believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
44658,Sheldon,"no, dr. feynman. if i solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
36468,Sheldon,"i bet he’s someone from babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
44661,Sheldon,"good morning. see? i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. so, how is everyone?"
36470,Sheldon,"you know, i’m given to understand that there is an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems. where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
36473,Sheldon,and how are you doing this fine evening?
44666,Sheldon,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
44669,Sheldon,"well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
36478,Sheldon,"penny. i realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
44671,Sheldon,fine.
44682,Sheldon,yes.
44684,Sheldon,"when we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. one night, it got so bad i almost grabbed toto "
36493,Sheldon,fine. i was spock. are you and leonard friends with benefits.
36494,Sheldon,are you and leonard friends with benefits?
44686,Sheldon,"do you know that when i get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat?"
36497,Sheldon,"i’m curious about the whole social construct. on its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. what i’ve observed, however, is howard wolowitz crying like a little girl."
44689,Sheldon,"if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
44690,Sheldon,"well, see, why can’t amy be that subservient? she has coitus one time, suddenly she’s gloria steinem. anyway, i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
36502,Sheldon,"thank you, that’s very helpful."
36503,Sheldon,are you suggesting i sleep on the couch.
36506,Sheldon,may i say one last thing.
36510,Sheldon,i’m homesick.
36514,Sheldon,i suppose we can stay up and talk.
44708,Sheldon,"i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. it, it was unnecessary. this is warm. oh, and also, i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
44709,Sheldon,"amy, you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women. and to prove how serious i am about us, i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level. "
44712,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s say that we were to entertain people. what type of gathering did you have in mind? huh? a meal? lunch? brunch? dinner? afternoon tea? a formal tea? hmm? is it a party? and if so, what kind of party? is it a cocktail party? a tupperware party? ooh, is it a surprise party? oh, i hope it’s not a west coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a west coast party don’t stop."
36523,Sheldon,i believe it is. the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
44716,Sheldon,"yes. oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. or possibly penguins. her english is atrocious."
44721,Sheldon,"the average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. if that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
44724,Sheldon,she’s learning english from tv.
36535,Sheldon,"you have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. if that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
44729,Sheldon,"hmm. you see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. help me out here, this is not where i shine."
36538,Sheldon,but the mission is for six months.
44731,Sheldon,oh. thank you. 
36540,Sheldon,i agree. it’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. check your messages.
44732,Sheldon,"well, no, that’s not true. i mean, sometimes it’s koothrappali. but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
36542,Sheldon,"for what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make jesus cry."
44733,Sheldon,"stuart, wait. i do know what it feels like to be left out. "
36548,Sheldon,you’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
36549,Sheldon,"if you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
36551,Sheldon,why does leonard get to go?
44743,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
44745,Sheldon,hit it.
36554,Sheldon,"i don’t see why i have to worry. my career’s not hanging in the balance. that was a joke. it’s funny, because it’s true."
36556,Sheldon,i can’t comment without violating our agreement that i don’t criticize your work.
44754,Sheldon,"you know, if you’d like, i could call your landlord and complain."
44755,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t mind, i’m very good at complaining. if it were an olympic sport, i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold."
36564,Sheldon,"you, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. that entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
36565,Sheldon,"he didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. tell me what my other option was."
36566,Sheldon,do you remember the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic north pole?
44757,Sheldon,"i have a feeling you’re still doing it. but i find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
36568,Sheldon,"yes. in fact, he was quite enthusiastic. he said, “frankly, if i could send you tonight, i would.”"
36570,Sheldon,sarcasm?
36571,Sheldon,"i’m on the horns of a dilemma. can you imagine me, sheldon cooper, at the north pole?"
36572,Sheldon,"i’m not good with cold, leonard. how often have we had to leave a movie theatre because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast? i can’t go."
44765,Sheldon,"well, i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. i have no choice but to confront her."
36574,Sheldon,listen to you. how can i possibly go?
36575,Sheldon,"odd, president seibert posed the exact same question."
44768,Sheldon,"no, no, he’s over there."
44770,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. like that spider-man action figure that used to be on your desk."
44774,Sheldon,leonard?
36584,Sheldon,"well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
36585,Sheldon,"excellent. and just an fyi, as i am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. but don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
44780,Sheldon,how could you lie to me?
44781,Sheldon,it’s all right.
36592,Sheldon, penny.
44785,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
44789,Sheldon,"night. if we did continue living together, would it be here?"
36599,Sheldon,"yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. now where do we stand on the freezer?"
36603,Sheldon,two for two. i’m on fire.
44796,Sheldon,i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
44799,Sheldon,can we just focus on the decision i’m facing?
44806,Sheldon,"what, you’re familiar with the reference?"
44808,Sheldon,thank you.
44809,Sheldon,really?
44810,Sheldon,"huh. yeah, i wonder if that’s related to the 12th century persian philosopher, al-ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
36620,Sheldon,"assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? did she say it?"
44812,Sheldon,how much will it hurt?
44819,Sheldon,"no, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. you know those things bother me. it’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
36632,Sheldon,"flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
36634,Sheldon,three months. this is gonna be great!
44827,Sheldon,"look, look, here i am standing next to the incubator. uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
36636,Sheldon,"oh, hi mom. no, i told you i’d call you when i got home, i’m not home yet.  alright, i’m home. the arctic expedition was a remarkable success, i’m all but certain there’s a nobel prize in my future. actually, i shouldn’t say that. i’m entirely certain. no, mother, i could not feel your church group praying for my safety. the fact that i’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc. no, i’m not sassing you in eskimo talk."
44830,Sheldon,"well, i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
44835,Sheldon,"yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
36645,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in the world of emoticons, i was colon, capital d."
44837,Sheldon,"uh, no. we lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
36660,Sheldon,i don’t have a sad song. i’m not a child.
44852,Sheldon,"hey, it’s not even called the genius grant, it’s the macarthur fellowship. just like it’s not frankenstein, it’s frankenstein’s monster. which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. and if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way i brought that full circle."
36662,Sheldon,are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize?
44861,Sheldon,you want me to read a geology paper?
36670,Sheldon,"but i would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. that man’s name was, surprise, surprise, albert einstein."
36671,Sheldon,"oh, you think you’re so clever. well, let me just tell you, while i do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
44862,Sheldon,"yeh, why? eh, why? oh, that’s why."
44863,Sheldon,"i hope you’re happy making me read this. bert’s work is remarkable, and i’m more upset than ever. this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining."
44866,Sheldon,fine. you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
44869,Sheldon,how did you deal with it?
36678,Sheldon,my objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
44870,Sheldon,"i can’t believe i was surpassed by a geologist. i mean, rocks. he studies rocks. if rock is so great, how come paper beats it? leonard, i’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
44871,Sheldon,perhaps i will. this rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. i will cast you far away. feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
44873,Sheldon,i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
36689,Sheldon,"oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
36690,Sheldon,"excuse me, wolverine: origin. miniseries issue two, page 22. retractable bone claws. if you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
36691,Sheldon,tandoori palace?
44884,Sheldon,"well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
36695,Sheldon,"if that’s morse code, that’s terrible. as i was saying, you and leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. earlier this evening, leonard characterized it as just fine. so what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
36697,Sheldon,"is this it? it was inappropriate to discuss leonard and penny’s sex life in front of leonard and penny.  oh, good! now i can eat."
44889,Sheldon,sorry i’m moving slowly.
44890,Sheldon,"oh, no. a plaque? nobody wants to see this."
44894,Sheldon,"i was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, i’d somehow be unburdened."
44899,Sheldon,"i didn’t punch him. he turned around, and i gave him a captain kirk karate chop. i’m not even sure he knows i did it."
44911,Sheldon,"yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
44913,Sheldon,"yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, i can hang it right now."
44914,Sheldon,what happened to them?
44916,Sheldon,"that seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
44919,Sheldon,"oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
36732,Sheldon,old comic book. i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
44929,Sheldon,"it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing, i skipped kindergarten."
36738,Sheldon,"well, i wish i could."
36743,Sheldon,"leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. i lost a bet to wolowitz."
36746,Sheldon,have i crossed some sort of line again?
36752,Sheldon,"dear lord, are you still going to be here on french toast day?"
36753,Sheldon,"look, leonard, penny made french toast."
44944,Sheldon,"that’s true, but had i done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id."
44948,Sheldon,dividing our belongings is difficult.
36764,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. ooh, penny, it’s as if the cheesecake factory is run by witches."
36766,Sheldon,you said be nice to penny. i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
36770,Sheldon,did you? i didn’t notice. have a chocolate.
44963,Sheldon,"it doesn’t matter what i want. it’s your birthday, you decide."
44965,Sheldon,grape. i find it the most mild.
44968,Sheldon,very well.
36777,Sheldon,"there’s just no pleasing you, is there, leonard? you weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of thorndike and b.f. skinner. by this time next week, i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
44975,Sheldon,who’s killing the mood now?
36785,Sheldon,"no, that would be incongruous, i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
44977,Sheldon,wowza.
44978,Sheldon,"what, a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff? how scandalous. you naughty girl, you went to the wizarding world theme park without me."
36795,Sheldon,the parade.
44993,Sheldon,"yeah. it is good to be home. oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
36802,Sheldon,"forgive me, as you know, i’m no adept at reading facial cues, but i’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
36804,Sheldon,elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
45001,Sheldon,"given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
36810,Sheldon,nailed it.
45008,Sheldon,"well, this is highly insulting."
36825,Sheldon,bazinga! you’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. i’m your boss now. you may want to laugh at that.
45027,Sheldon,yeah. here. i’ll catch you up.
45028,Sheldon,how did we get in the car?
45036,Sheldon,what? is there another twist coming? is the baby not theirs at all?
36845,Sheldon,"fine.  oh, lord. dr. koothrappali, as your superior, i forbid you from writing on my board!"
45038,Sheldon,"thank you, internet. i’m telling you, with the right youtube video, i can give howard a vasectomy."
36852,Sheldon,in this context for me could mean with me.
36856,Sheldon,"i can’t. there’s a big dog outside. on the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles."
36857,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. you can’t possibly win.
36859,Sheldon,"from your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
45051,Sheldon,"leonard, she might be drunk. all she had was chips."
45052,Sheldon,"amy is free. she had a harp lesson on saturday but it got cancelled. boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense. "
36863,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, no."
45056,Sheldon,bye.
36867,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, but i have no interest in playing a game in which i find no challenge."
36868,Sheldon,i have money.
45062,Sheldon,yes.
36874,Sheldon,"thank you. you know, i can buy all these things online. i come here for the personal service."
45066,Sheldon,"wow, and i remember when you loved playing games with me. maybe penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
36877,Sheldon,"i was such a fan that in 1995, i travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in jackson, mississippi, wearing my star fleet academy cadet uniform in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package wesley crusher action figure."
45071,Sheldon,"hello, amy. it’s nice to see you."
36881,Sheldon,"from hell’s heart, i stab at thee."
45073,Sheldon,"you know what? if you’d like, i could whip up a quick relationship agreement. well, i’m at a spa, i might as well do something relaxing. "
36886,Sheldon,silence!
36887,Sheldon,"i play my endless serpent. raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means larry will have to play chaos overlord, then captain sweatpants, molten river. i play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. now fetch me wil wheaton! bortas bir jablu’di’ reh qaqqu’ nay’"
45079,Sheldon,"i get to write a contract? i say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
45085,Sheldon,doesn’t like games. that’s one.
36896,Sheldon,your mee-maw died? that’s terrible.
36901,Sheldon,i… i… i don’t understand. your grandmother’s alive?
45093,Sheldon,"don’t fall for it. he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
36906,Sheldon,"wolowitz is trying to outflank us. let out some string, add altitude and i’ll go under and cut his line."
45098,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re just showing off."
45099,Sheldon,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing. it could help me be a more considerate friend.
36919,Sheldon,"if you want to blend in with penny’s friends, i’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
36920,Sheldon,"that’s exactly what my father said. come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time i was five until i went off to college. longest seven years of my life."
45116,Sheldon,yes.
36928,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
45127,Sheldon,"it’s more than that. it’s me. i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
45130,Sheldon,"i feel the same way about you. now, put your glasses back on. you look weird."
36940,Sheldon,i can see that. i was providing you with an alternative. a courtesy i was never offered in similar circumstances.
36942,Sheldon,oh! great roll! now you can demolish your soviet-style cyclotron and build the large hadron collider.
45141,Sheldon,"i’m looking at the math, and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
36953,Sheldon,has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
45150,Sheldon,no idea. all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
45151,Sheldon,"oh, no. it’s not just me. no. the railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
45152,Sheldon,you.
36961,Sheldon,"come on, come on, we’re late."
36962,Sheldon,"i believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. the movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on colorado boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
36963,Sheldon,"go, go, power rangers, go!"
36964,Sheldon,"no, we’re not. we’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
45156,Sheldon,"i said to myself, i think i can, i think i can. and then i couldn’t, so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
36967,Sheldon,got it.
45163,Sheldon,"oh. well, i guess it’s fixed."
45165,Sheldon,"well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
36974,Sheldon,"i have a few questions. first, i notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
45166,Sheldon,"okay, but this is the last time. nice try, blockheads."
45167,Sheldon,excuse me. i have a girlfriend. i’m already king of the train store.
36979,Sheldon,yes.
45182,Sheldon,why?
36993,Sheldon,right now would be good.
45185,Sheldon,hello.
45189,Sheldon,"bert, i insist that you join us."
36999,Sheldon,i want that one.
45196,Sheldon,why aren’t you talking to me?
45208,Sheldon,"i’m sorry you were embarrassed. and now i understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, dr. fink."
37021,Sheldon,i see no organizational system in here whatsoever. which panties do you wear on mondays?
45213,Sheldon,fine. two years ago i got my driver’s license.
37028,Sheldon,don’t look?
45226,Sheldon,he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
45227,Sheldon,what emergency happened at the l.a. zoo?
37041,Sheldon,"that can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. we need to find a service station."
45237,Sheldon,i’m gonna go as dumbledore.
45241,Sheldon,"i’m always honest with amy. the other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and i said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. when there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
45245,Sheldon,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comic-con. he’s just doing it to make her happy.
45247,Sheldon,why?
37056,Sheldon,"i’ll put, in progress. okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
45249,Sheldon,hello.
45250,Sheldon,are you listening to this? they deceive each other about everything.
37064,Sheldon,"i see. now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
37065,Sheldon,"oh, good, my turn. well, this is very exciting and i wanted you to be among the first to know…"
45256,Sheldon,"when the irs questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
45261,Sheldon,there’s my pretty girlfriend.
37071,Sheldon,"all right. these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow. i need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
45263,Sheldon,"well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. it’s a list of this year’s panelists. it’s long, isn’t it?"
37073,Sheldon,hello.
37075,Sheldon,"biologically speaking, howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
45267,Sheldon,roofing.
45271,Sheldon,"if real dogs gave me buttons, i’d like them, too. well, i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
37081,Sheldon,what do you want?
37084,Sheldon,i refuse to sink to his level.
45279,Sheldon,"yes, probably. but until we know for sure, how can i feel better?"
45283,Sheldon,"uh, wait, before we eat, i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj."
37096,Sheldon,"it may be low-tech, but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
37097,Sheldon,there is no abort.
45288,Sheldon,can you believe this guy?
45290,Sheldon,fine. you took my room. you turned my friends against me. i hope you’re happy.
45296,Sheldon,i hadn’t thought about that.
45297,Sheldon,"i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. boy, you’re good."
37106,Sheldon,perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
37107,Sheldon,my mother was right. hell is real.
37108,Sheldon,"yes. leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  while i appreciate the oh, snap, i’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
45300,Sheldon,"no, i can’t take all the credit. i spoke with leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
45301,Sheldon,"beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy, in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship."
37112,Sheldon,that’s not fair. i got stuck behind a tree.
37114,Sheldon,"it’s not about shoes, is it? i don’t think i could go through that again."
45308,Sheldon,"penny would be the entree. then leonard’s basically a cheese course. and because i love you, you’re dessert."
45309,Sheldon,"you know what? i’m proud of us. yeah, with penny and leonard taking in raj, and stuart living with howard and bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
37121,Sheldon,"okay, point. what sort of foundation do you have? did you take any science classes in school?"
37126,Sheldon,"research journal, entry one. i’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching penny physics. i’m calling it project gorilla."
37128,Sheldon,"one moment. subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. apparently, ignorance is bliss. all right, let us begin. where’s your notebook?"
45322,Sheldon,that is a valid point. perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
45328,Sheldon,"i’d write that down, but i can’t now, can i?"
37138,Sheldon,"now, remember, newton realized that aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. so let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as a and we get force, earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. so we can see that ma equals mg and what do we know from this?"
45330,Sheldon,fire away.
45334,Sheldon,"ooh, that sounds fun. now, we’re talking about real treats, right? not bible verses like my mother used to give me."
45337,Sheldon,"by the way, your name can go first."
37146,Sheldon,greece.
45338,Sheldon,"yeah, the math is so inelegant. i’m not even sure it makes sense."
37148,Sheldon,no.
45344,Sheldon,"just because i am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive."
37154,Sheldon,it’s not. that’s why leonard does it.
37158,Sheldon,"tears seem appropriate. enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
45353,Sheldon,i love that one.
45355,Sheldon,hello.
37169,Sheldon,"well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
37170,Sheldon,"if i can interject here, obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
37171,Sheldon,"if i can interject again. leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. he probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu."
45363,Sheldon,"oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
45365,Sheldon,"the coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. and over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. and lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
37175,Sheldon,august 16th. right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
37176,Sheldon,you did.
45370,Sheldon,"yeah, i felt the same way about the platypus. you know, bird and mammal in the same creature? no way. and spoiler, way."
37180,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure about interesting, but…"
37181,Sheldon,very well. shall we switch topics to isaac newton v. gottfried leibniz?
45372,Sheldon,"well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
45376,Sheldon,that didn’t happen.
37185,Sheldon, leonard?
45377,Sheldon,just do your laundry.
37188,Sheldon,it’s a conversation starter.
45381,Sheldon,"what? you hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? what happened to our love?"
37190,Sheldon,what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule known as sheldon alpha five.
37192,Sheldon,that’s not the comforting part.
45387,Sheldon,"my pants are missing, i don’t remember anything. penny, this is your youth. what do i do?"
45388,Sheldon,"leonard, would you be a lamb?"
37199,Sheldon,i blame penny.
45391,Sheldon,what’s the big deal? it’s full of classified information about the air force project.
45393,Sheldon,i’m trying.
45395,Sheldon,what does it say?
45396,Sheldon,where?
37209,Sheldon,i don’t need anything at the galleria. do you need anything at the galleria?
45401,Sheldon,"um, yes. howdy, partner. do you happen to recollect if i left a notebook in these here parts?"
37211,Sheldon,"well, that’s certainly amusing, but i have no interest."
45402,Sheldon,"it’s called fitting in. by the way, good luck."
45405,Sheldon,not to tell anyone.
45414,Sheldon,"all right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their a-game, good energy. hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
45417,Sheldon,"so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. how, howard, flashback sounds."
37229,Sheldon,okay. what is your game?
37230,Sheldon,"when i lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
37231,Sheldon,it’s a limited edition green lantern lantern. my friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
45422,Sheldon,"and now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments. "
37233,Sheldon,i thought your father was a gynaecologist. i’m sorry. 
45430,Sheldon,hold on. we don’t know anything about this woman. 
45432,Sheldon,"oh great, see you at seven. "
45441,Sheldon,your first date? did you even measure her walls?
45448,Sheldon,"actually, our friendship group is at capacity. but if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. unless it’s raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
45450,Sheldon,"oh, so many things. her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
37261,Sheldon,"oh god, oh god, oh, god! it’s all right. they didn’t take my comic books."
37264,Sheldon,when does the csi team get here?
37274,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
37282,Sheldon,uh-huh.
45476,Sheldon,"okay, i think i got that."
37285,Sheldon,i do tonight. it’s scary over there.
37287,Sheldon,all right. i’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
37288,Sheldon,bad idea.
45480,Sheldon,i hurt myself juggling.
37290,Sheldon, leonard and penny!
37292,Sheldon,what if someone steals my keys?
45486,Sheldon,"oh, i stopped that, it was dumb. uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
45487,Sheldon,"well, it is. if i wanted to hold three things at once, i’d wear cargo pants."
37303,Sheldon,"fine. good night to you, sir. miss."
45497,Sheldon,"i’m doing it. i’m doing it. i’m tall and i’m doing it.  ah, man."
45500,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ll definitely live long enough. vitamin c."
45503,Sheldon,this is disconcerting. 
45510,Sheldon,thank you. can we just talk about something else?
37319,Sheldon,then i’ve been up all night.
45519,Sheldon,i’m confused. you’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
37329,Sheldon,"peas! perfect, they can be electrons."
45526,Sheldon,what does it look like? i’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
37336,Sheldon,they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
37337,Sheldon,impaired cognitive function.
45530,Sheldon,so trick her.
45532,Sheldon,"no, it is. leonard pointed out to me that i’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
37343,Sheldon,"you can try, but you’ll never catch me. "
45536,Sheldon,"well, no, it’s just, i’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, i can’t skype it to you."
45538,Sheldon,"or, what if we fold them?"
37349,Sheldon,i came to tell you i’ve got the answer.
37352,Sheldon,albert einstein.
37354,Sheldon,"don’t be absurd. that’s in washington. you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. no. i’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
37356,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. good night to you, too. oh, by the way, i was watching you sleep for a moment, and i noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
45549,Sheldon,"and just remember, i am proud of you and i support you in all that you do."
37359,Sheldon,"i do. for thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. do you have anything like that?"
37360,Sheldon,shouldn’t you check your database?
37365,Sheldon,what’s sheetrock?
45561,Sheldon,"oh, thanks. dr. nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern. and she brought me this duty-free toblerone."
37375,Sheldon,yes.
37381,Sheldon,"actually, he might have to. there’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. the term was coined in 1976 by economist fred hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
45575,Sheldon,"yes, we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep."
37387,Sheldon,"of course, my good friend. come in. help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
45582,Sheldon,here you go.
45583,Sheldon,"hmm? oh, no, no, no. they’re from many famous people. see? oh, like this one. this is from patrick stewart. it says if i come to his house again, i get to meet his dogs. oh, excuse me."
37395,Sheldon,afraid not. do you recognize this?
37396,Sheldon,"indeed, the roommate agreement. i call your attention to the friendship rider in appendix c, future commitments. number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the large hadron collider, now under construction in switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
45587,Sheldon,"i must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. don’t you agree?"
37399,Sheldon,"i’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. at least once a day i ask how you are, even though i simply don’t care. i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing."
37401,Sheldon,very well.
45597,Sheldon,"because there’s only one of me, i’m more valuable."
37408,Sheldon,"yeah, i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. if you need to void your bladder before eating, i can keep them warm with this beret that i thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
37409,Sheldon,it’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. i’ve had some time to reflect and i’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. it’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. butterscotch scone?
45600,Sheldon,i think dr. nowitzki is a friendly colleague. i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
45608,Sheldon,oh boy.
45609,Sheldon,mommy.
45618,Sheldon,leonard! leonard i’m sick!
45631,Sheldon,hello penny. leonard just left.
37441,Sheldon,"well, look who thinks he’s stuart’s uncle now."
37442,Sheldon,i’ve decided i’m going to have mr. lee sign my copy of this month’s batman.
45638,Sheldon,is that woman aishwarya rai?
37447,Sheldon,because most of the things i’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
37450,Sheldon,it bothers me.
45644,Sheldon,hmmmm?
37453,Sheldon,"yes, it is."
37454,Sheldon,"penny, i have an eidetic memory. also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
37455,Sheldon,"okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
45648,Sheldon,i’ve got it! i finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
37458,Sheldon,i’m not going to pay a fine. that would imply i’m guilty.
45650,Sheldon,"hello, puny insects. as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike."
37462,Sheldon,"well, you’re my friends. you’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when i’m victorious."
45655,Sheldon,"hello, kripke. yes, sheldon cooper here. it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see. well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… i see. no, no, no, wait. don’t hang up yet. what about a recreational activity? i bet we share some common interests. tell me an interest of yours. really? on actual horses? tell me another interest of yours. oh no, i’m sorry, i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to. tell me another interest of yours."
37466,Sheldon,please try to wear something appropriate. it won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
37470,Sheldon,"i’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. so shall we rehearse?"
45667,Sheldon,gentlemen.
37480,Sheldon,thank you.
45674,Sheldon,behind you.
45676,Sheldon,i’d be much further along if i’d been allowed to practice.
37488,Sheldon,please tell the judge i’m ready to apologize.
37489,Sheldon,you know very well how it went.
45680,Sheldon,mine!
37491,Sheldon,"i also now have three points on a driver’s licence i do not yet possess, and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
45681,Sheldon,"oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. uh, mute, please."
45683,Sheldon,"pee for houston, pee for austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. and shake twice for texas."
37494,Sheldon,"not finished. it is because of you that i now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee."
37495,Sheldon,"no, no. i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to have gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime. the moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
45691,Sheldon,"the stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of texas."
45692,Sheldon,"the prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…"
37501,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you where i’ve been. you boys may have had gelato with stan lee and gotten autographed comics, but i saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
45696,Sheldon,you said to do whatever feels natural. this feels natural. certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
37505,Sheldon,"who’s adam west? leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
45701,Sheldon,"i’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home."
37511,Sheldon,"if you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by sauron in mount doom, i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
45703,Sheldon,would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? and the answer was elephant!
37513,Sheldon,"other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
37514,Sheldon,"we can’t sell it. we have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
37515,Sheldon,you mean my ring?
37521,Sheldon," it’s not the first time. i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. if only i’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then i’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly christmas letter."
45714,Sheldon,"take the hint, stuart. the lady said good night."
45715,Sheldon,good lord! would you stop that caterwauling!
37525,Sheldon,"excellent, excellent. tire each other out, the ring will be mine. howard, why don’t you go after raj’s mother?"
45717,Sheldon,ew!
45718,Sheldon,i’m not sure how to do this.
45721,Sheldon,i’m going to need a larger shirt. this one’s a little tight under the arms.
37532,Sheldon,waterfalls!
37535,Sheldon,"oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. i have to pee."
45728,Sheldon,"president siebert, listen to reason. yeah, i understand i don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. i… yes, i’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. and i know you were there, because i saw you through the mail slot. yeah, well, that’s some salty language. may i remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the potty mouth club. there it is again. do you kiss your mother with that mouth? oh, well, i’m sorry for your loss. good night, sir. unbelievable. he says wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university."
45729,Sheldon,"and the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. but, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. the end."
37538,Sheldon,i’ve done it! i’ve won! the ring is mine! it’s mine!  where’s the ring?
37539,Sheldon,i knew it. give us the precious!
45731,Sheldon,"hello, syfy network? yeah, this is your vice president of programming. now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding alphas. yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and i don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if i really am who i say i am, you know? i just. i want this done. no, i am not the person who just called. that man was clearly a cowboy. yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. why do they keep hanging up on me?"
37541,Sheldon,"and you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? i am the william shatner of theoretical physics. all right, i’ll play. what self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
45732,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in bed?"
45735,Sheldon,"do you realize that in less than nine hours, arthur jeffries, aka professor proton, will be in our apartment?"
37545,Sheldon,they expect me to give a speech at the banquet. i can’t give a speech.
45740,Sheldon,i still can’t sleep.
45743,Sheldon,"penny, it’s your lucky day. three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. grab your keys."
45745,Sheldon,amy? amy? did you hear what i said?
45747,Sheldon,"hawkman. it’s your old buddy sheldonoscopy. how come you didn’t pick up the phone? oh, right. my bad."
45757,Sheldon,"i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and i’d like to tell you why i should be chosen to go to mars. i’m exceedingly smart. i graduated college at 14. while my brother was getting an std i was getting a phd. penicillin can’t take this away. being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. in fact, animals don’t trust me because i smell like nothing. literally nothing. during the seven-month space flight, i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. hey, leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
37567,Sheldon,"when i was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
37570,Sheldon,"sim city. more specifically, the sim city i designed, sheldonopolis."
45762,Sheldon,"hello, mother."
37575,Sheldon,"you know, the nice thing about shel-mart is i own it, so i get a 15% discount."
37576,Sheldon,"look, i didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
37587,Sheldon,"that’s how you start a psychotherapy session? how am i doing? i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. instead, i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph’s."
37588,Sheldon,would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams?
37589,Sheldon,"i recently had a dream that i was a giant. but everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
45779,Sheldon,no.
45783,Sheldon,whoopee!
37593,Sheldon,and how did that make you feel?
37601,Sheldon,alcohol? i don’t drink alcohol.
45795,Sheldon,perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
37606,Sheldon,"question one, where are my pants?"
37607,Sheldon,what do i search?
45802,Sheldon,sing me soft kitty.
37611,Sheldon,"not literally. but as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
37615,Sheldon,but i sense you’re going to and i don’t want to hear about it. excuse me.
45814,Sheldon,can you tell me the specials this evening?
37623,Sheldon,please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
45819,Sheldon,it’s still six spots above steve jobs. i care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
37630,Sheldon,"a common spare. the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant. before you jump on twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. i am the ball. my thoughts are its thoughts. its holes are my holes.  yes. tweet that, tweety bird."
37638,Sheldon,no. clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
37640,Sheldon,"you want me to remove him from the team? i’m the captain, i can do that."
37646,Sheldon,"no, not the wesley crushers. the wesley “crushers.”"
37649,Sheldon,do you people even hear yourselves? it’s not the wesley crushers. it’s not the “wesley” crushers. it’s the wesley “crushers.”
37653,Sheldon,"no, after you, as we are currently crushing you, wesley."
37656,Sheldon,that’s not even from your franchise!
37658,Sheldon,you weren’t the ball.
37664,Sheldon,"enjoy the accolades now, wil wheaton, but like your time on star trek: next generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
37665,Sheldon,"all right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
37666,Sheldon,"wait! where are you going? penny, come back! i’ll get you ice cream!"
37669,Sheldon,"no, i suppose not."
37671,Sheldon,uh-oh.
37679,Sheldon,"or fornication. yeah. but that has judgmental overtones, so i’ll hold that in reserve."
37683,Sheldon,i’d rather you pretend i didn’t say it. i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
37696,Sheldon,"excuse me, i’m thirsty, so i’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
37699,Sheldon,"oh, that’s not necessary. you can go first."
37700,Sheldon,i can’t think of a reason why not.
37701,Sheldon,"hold on. nope, no reason."
37704,Sheldon,i didn’t say outside.
37707,Sheldon,i’m going the other way. bye.
37709,Sheldon,perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
37711,Sheldon,"oh. hello, doggie. nice doggie. i bet you think you smell hot dogs. look, a cat!"
37714,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, he said, i’m fine, i don’t care. and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
37715,Sheldon,i’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
37726,Sheldon,i got lost.
37736,Sheldon,i’ve been seeing penny behind your back.
37741,Sheldon,"oh. well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified?"
37760,Sheldon,"i didn’t realize i was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. you enjoy canadian bacon. i’ve been to toronto."
37763,Sheldon,"a, i rarely kid. and b, when i do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
37773,Sheldon,"shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends brad and angelina."
37777,Sheldon,"i would imagine it is. this is my friend and roommate, dr. leonard hofstadter."
37778,Sheldon,i apologize. he’s only an experimental physicist.
37798,Sheldon,"ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. i’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
37805,Sheldon,the implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
37818,Sheldon,there’s doubt?
37820,Sheldon,there you go.
37821,Sheldon,good what?
37832,Sheldon,hello.
37833,Sheldon,"yes. in 1917, when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper zur quantentheorie der strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
37834,Sheldon,"see, now this is a man for penny."
37851,Sheldon,she returned to her apartment. i presume to shower and vomit. not necessarily in that order.
37854,Sheldon,who’s going to tell whom about what?
37858,Sheldon,it’s a time of day i invented. it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. preevning. i’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
37861,Sheldon,"please. even assuming you could answer any question the way i would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
37862,Sheldon,"well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why i’m having this conversation with you."
37863,Sheldon,he didn’t date. it was pon farr. his blood boiled with mating lust.
37865,Sheldon,"as i will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. but for the record, i only drink hot chocolate in months with an r in them."
37869,Sheldon,"in a few minutes, when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer i do it? the standard i told you so? the classic neener-neener? or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
37872,Sheldon,interesting. my mother and i have the same agreement about church.
37874,Sheldon,may i buy you a beverage?
37882,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
37896,Sheldon,huh. it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
37902,Sheldon,you know i don’t drive.
37904,Sheldon,"actually, i’m paraphrasing. having been raised in a christian household, i’m uncomfortable with the language he used. and to be honest, i’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
37907,Sheldon,i’m sorry. do you have other plans?
37908,Sheldon,so this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
37919,Sheldon,no.
37922,Sheldon,muggles.
37933,Sheldon,this is an interesting topic. how many sexual encounters have you had?
37934,Sheldon,i should think so.
37943,Sheldon,the humorous implication being that i am wile e. coyote?
37952,Sheldon,"the earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
37955,Sheldon,a hybrid dog and octopus. man’s underwater best friend.
37959,Sheldon,"not for me. thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night. tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
37962,Sheldon,correct.
37965,Sheldon,"certainly. i’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent p.e. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
37966,Sheldon,"that’s an excellent idea. yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
37968,Sheldon,"well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung’s disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
37978,Sheldon,what about your pedometer?
37990,Sheldon,"coming! . greetings, friends."
37996,Sheldon,"you have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
38000,Sheldon,uganda.
38001,Sheldon,"kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. a central african power block is formed, colonizing north africa and europe. when war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. kenya withers, uganda triumphs."
38006,Sheldon,it’s fun for ages eight to eighty. join us.
38018,Sheldon,"she’s not my girlfriend. she’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
38022,Sheldon,so?
38024,Sheldon,"may i point out that for eight long months, i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore."
38025,Sheldon,yes. and i’d thank you to do the same.
38026,Sheldon,greetings.
38032,Sheldon,"that’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s!"
38041,Sheldon,"penny, i assure you, i’m fine. my relationship with amy was purely intellectual. there were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. the relationship simply outlived its utility, and i’m continuing on with my life as before."
38042,Sheldon,"now, if you’ll excuse me, i’m off to buy a pussycat."
38046,Sheldon,robert oppenheimer was lonely.
38049,Sheldon,about what?
38051,Sheldon,a group of cats is a clowder. or a glaring.
38057,Sheldon,come in. 
38060,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
38061,Sheldon,"oh, that’s preposterous. i’m not pining over anyone."
38064,Sheldon,aw. what is she doing here?
38065,Sheldon,"well, rest assured, i am in full possession of my faculties."
38079,Sheldon,"you’re wrong again. if my superpower were arrogance, my name would be dr. arroganto."
38084,Sheldon,correct.
38087,Sheldon,yes.
38091,Sheldon,"all right, all right. he can buy his own desk."
38097,Sheldon,it’s actually british.
38107,Sheldon,yes.
38112,Sheldon,yes?
38115,Sheldon,"well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
38121,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my best friend. i’ve known you for seven years, and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler."
38122,Sheldon,i sense judgment on your part.
38127,Sheldon,"you know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
38138,Sheldon,are you ill?
38140,Sheldon,i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
38141,Sheldon,you’re welcome. but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
38142,Sheldon,since we got home from the comic bookstore.
38150,Sheldon,"well, i have to void my bladder. it was nice spending this time with you."
38151,Sheldon,yes?
38154,Sheldon,amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
38156,Sheldon,uh-huh.
38157,Sheldon,wait. what?
38158,Sheldon,i don’t want the next level. i like this level. fix it for me!
38161,Sheldon,wait! what am i supposed to do?
38164,Sheldon,amy’s right. he is tedious.
38166,Sheldon,i’m removing my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
38167,Sheldon,exactly.
38175,Sheldon,way to go on the details.
38182,Sheldon,"my apologies. good night, amy."
38186,Sheldon,"agreed. amy, i find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. bazinga. bedtime. please show yourself out."
21805,Sheldon,no! that’s where i sit!
21806,Sheldon,"this seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. it also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. as a result, i’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
38192,Sheldon,cobbler. i’m still laughing.
21808,Sheldon,hmm.
38194,Sheldon,"the fun starts with brunch at carney’s in studio city, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. next stop, travel town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the hollywood carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
21814,Sheldon,"last question. in a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
21816,Sheldon,the second barrier. don’t get cocky. this is the bathroom. are you fairly regular?
21817,Sheldon,this isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. when do you evacuate your bowels?
38203,Sheldon,"oh yes. it runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
21820,Sheldon,third barrier passed. you have won the right to see your room. huzzah!
38210,Sheldon,five more minutes.
38211,Sheldon,everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
21836,Sheldon,explain the couch.
21839,Sheldon,"but you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
38226,Sheldon,"really? leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
38229,Sheldon,excellent choice.
38230,Sheldon,priya?
21848,Sheldon,"they don’t get a vote. it’s one against one. and according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
38235,Sheldon,perhaps. but they might ask me something else.
21851,Sheldon,you’re protected by your turtleneck.
38239,Sheldon,and raj.
21856,Sheldon,won’t work.
38241,Sheldon,"violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
21858,Sheldon,"this is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
21861,Sheldon,you’re welcome. 
38247,Sheldon,"alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl. which i’ve now just told to batman. see, i can’t keep a secret."
38255,Sheldon,and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
38261,Sheldon,"did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
38269,Sheldon,you used my toothbrush?
38271,Sheldon,with real puffing smoke?
38276,Sheldon,you’re so close.
38289,Sheldon,oh. all right. i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex.
38293,Sheldon,"a little, but go on."
38294,Sheldon,"i’m going to answer that with a visual aid. this is my nine-disc complete lord of the rings trilogy blu-ray set.  mr. wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping i wouldn’t notice. would you characterize that as responsible?"
38301,Sheldon,"oh, good. i was afraid you were going to fixate on that mars rover incident."
38302,Sheldon,"well, your expectations have been subverted. aha."
38306,Sheldon,"well, i did mention the mars rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance."
38307,Sheldon,but why should that keep me up?
38311,Sheldon,"that seems fairly conclusive.  no, gorn, no. that’s where i sit."
38314,Sheldon,no.
38322,Sheldon,"if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry christmas. think about that, dr. tyson."
38325,Sheldon,"no. if anything, i made it worse. in any case, i have been riddled with guilt, which is causing gorn-infested rem sleep. so, i’m here now to say i’m sorry."
38334,Sheldon,ah. blame president james “jimmy” carter. he started america on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. he wonders why he was a one-term president.
38339,Sheldon,all right. to the metric system.  i can’t taste the cherries.
38352,Sheldon,there’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
38354,Sheldon,"nevertheless, i’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, i want you to have this."
38357,Sheldon,high five. not too hard. thank you.
38373,Sheldon,hugh.
38375,Sheldon,"under normal circumstances i’d say, i told you so. but as i have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. therefore, i will be replacing it with the phrase i informed you thusly."
38383,Sheldon,"well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. no cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
38385,Sheldon,"this is indiana jones, not star trek. there should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. and even at star trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
38387,Sheldon,"listen to what mr. wil wheaton is tweeting. best seats in house for raiders screening. suck on that, sheldon cooper."
38390,Sheldon,no!
38391,Sheldon,this is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
38392,Sheldon,you know what? i’m going back to i told you so. i told you so.
38394,Sheldon,you whistled?
38398,Sheldon,"don’t worry, wil wheaton. i was just leaving.  da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
38399,Sheldon,"da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
38407,Sheldon,"well, who would ever guess that?"
38410,Sheldon,i’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
38418,Sheldon,"i’m going to propose a hypothesis. last night, raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the united states government to keep it a secret."
38421,Sheldon,clarify something for me. isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? an opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
38428,Sheldon,"well, you’re the expert. if the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then i yield."
38432,Sheldon,all right. what were the symptoms?
38438,Sheldon,"all right, let’s start over. what did you say when zack walked in?"
38444,Sheldon,are you sure? you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
38445,Sheldon,hang on. i don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
38446,Sheldon,"a cross we all must bear. you know, in difficult moments like this, i often turn to a force greater than myself."
38449,Sheldon,cheap science fiction?
38464,Sheldon,it’s illegal to spay a human being.
38470,Sheldon,are you sure this is what you want to do?
38473,Sheldon,i’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
38475,Sheldon,not so fast. infinite sheldon.
38477,Sheldon,"no, although it’s a question i’ve been pondering since preschool."
38484,Sheldon,penny.
38486,Sheldon,milk dud?
38487,Sheldon,literally? literally a million years?
38499,Sheldon,this is how the flash paces.
38524,Sheldon,"you know, leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. very good."
38530,Sheldon,hardly. consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. a young woman alone in the big city. her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
38531,Sheldon,"then it hits her. how is she going to survive? i mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. and then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend howard."
38532,Sheldon,"she befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
38534,Sheldon,"all right, i’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
38536,Sheldon,"duly noted, steve from wichita."
38543,Sheldon,"good one, boss."
38549,Sheldon,does it? a happy accident.
38554,Sheldon,is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
38555,Sheldon,i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
38556,Sheldon,"when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
38557,Sheldon,"all right, let’s get right to the vote. show of hands all those opposed to leonard and his reign of tyranny."
38579,Sheldon,could have beaten around the bush a little.
38581,Sheldon,leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. and his app team.
38585,Sheldon,with you?
38589,Sheldon,"oh, penny, where do i begin? the simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
38593,Sheldon,do you have those little marshmallows?
38604,Sheldon,"oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
38606,Sheldon,"before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership."
38607,Sheldon,"well, i must say, i am impressed."
38608,Sheldon,you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
38610,Sheldon,bored.
38612,Sheldon,"since we come in every tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, i believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, how are they hanging?"
38614,Sheldon,"in order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
38617,Sheldon,"good morning. if i could have everyone’s attention, please? i know we’re all eager to get on the road to big sur, so if we focus, i’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. then it’s just q&a, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
38620,Sheldon,"she made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
38623,Sheldon,"copy that, red five. radio contact is sufficient. no need to extend your middle finger."
38625,Sheldon,no. amy?
38627,Sheldon,"amy, it’s penny’s turn. penny?"
38631,Sheldon,although road trip god does have a certain ring to it.
38639,Sheldon,"all right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
38644,Sheldon,"good evening. i’m your guest lecturer, dr. sheldon cooper. i was expecting applause, but i suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. i agreed to speak to you this evening, because i was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. hmm. of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. best and brightest, my sweet patootie. all right, let’s begin. show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? don’t kid yourselves."
38648,Sheldon,"oh, tweets about my lecture. hmm. that’s rather unfair. that’s downright cruel. plus, insects have six legs. yeah, i’m not familiar with the acronym kmn."
38649,Sheldon,"well, i suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. i think i’ll turn in. i didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
38651,Sheldon,no.
38653,Sheldon,for instance?
38662,Sheldon,"it has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, i suck the big one."
38664,Sheldon,i suppose that’s one way to look at it.
38665,Sheldon,are you going to help me or not?
38667,Sheldon,i’ll pay you 40 dollars.
38668,Sheldon, penny.
38673,Sheldon,"penny, my body and i have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
38676,Sheldon,gotcha.
38686,Sheldon,you have any frozen yogurt?
38687,Sheldon,yes. i didn’t care for it.
38697,Sheldon,hoo!
38698,Sheldon,"shelly! shelly, how many times have i told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? goodness, i’ll never understand that boy. but then again, i’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
38699,Sheldon,"glory be to heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. george, put down that pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
38720,Sheldon,"don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
38731,Sheldon,"okay, i see what’s happening."
38738,Sheldon,why?
38745,Sheldon,"just a few things you may need tonight. there’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something i procured from the school of pharmacology. they say it is to viagra as viagra is to a green m&m."
38746,Sheldon,maybe this will overcome your reluctance. i went on the internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old mrs. latham to get your libido humming. check out those saddle shoes. rar!
38748,Sheldon,"given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
38749,Sheldon,no. but thank you for asking.
38755,Sheldon,what?
38764,Sheldon,"don’t worry. as your tertiary friend, i am prepared to step in and comfort you."
38766,Sheldon,that’s what tertiary friends are for.
38767,Sheldon,would you be sleeping over again this evening? because you’re welcome to.
38768,Sheldon,"well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, i stand at the ready."
38771,Sheldon,"priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to, if i may quote howard, do the dance with no pants."
38772,Sheldon,"that’s remarkable. if pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace german shepherds at our nation’s airports."
38776,Sheldon,it’s actually thai. you’re slipping.
38780,Sheldon,"actually, it’s the three of us."
38781,Sheldon,right. i’ll make tea.
38788,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
38795,Sheldon,"oh, dear!"
38799,Sheldon,is it about me or the dead pixels?
38801,Sheldon,"excuse me. before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
38814,Sheldon,cluck-cluck-cluck.
38824,Sheldon,okay. i have guests coming. i’m afraid i’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
38826,Sheldon,"and good-bye to you, sir. he’ll be back."
38828,Sheldon,"that’s very nice, stuart. zack?"
38830,Sheldon,"patience, patience, barry. the whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
38832,Sheldon,question. was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub?
38838,Sheldon,"better. it has a gold crown. you see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution. because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. but, while bathing, archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
38842,Sheldon,no.
38858,Sheldon,not knowing is part of the fun. was that the motto of your community college?
38859,Sheldon,this deck is rigged in some fashion.
38873,Sheldon,"relax, we’re not under attack right now."
38877,Sheldon,all right. pick a card.
38878,Sheldon,bippity-boppity-boo.
38889,Sheldon,"they stole everything, leonard, everything."
38890,Sheldon,"what didn’t they get? they got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
38891,Sheldon,"what choice did i have? the mighty sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. plus, the fbi hung up on me."
38892,Sheldon,they took my battle ostrich.
38893,Sheldon,"yes, glenn! the only bird i ever loved."
38911,Sheldon,and people think i don’t get sarcasm.
38915,Sheldon,excellent! it’s in a cul-de-sac. we can box him in.
38917,Sheldon,"i don’t know if you’ve been following the news, leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
38920,Sheldon,sure.
38921,Sheldon,fine. leonard?
38925,Sheldon,"sea world is better. it has shamu, who is literally tons of fun. but for the moment, let’s stay focused on todd zarnecki."
38927,Sheldon,this says beyonce bootylicious dance mix.
38929,Sheldon,i always prefer the train.
38930,Sheldon,coming.
38935,Sheldon,your doom!
38937,Sheldon,are you todd zarnecki?
38940,Sheldon,"well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
38942,Sheldon,of course.
38952,Sheldon,"really, amy? gossip? i’m disappointed in you."
38953,Sheldon,"forgive my language, but poppycock."
38957,Sheldon,"have you ever considered trying to do something useful? perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
38959,Sheldon,thank you. my father taught me archery as a child. it’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of kmart bourbon.
38962,Sheldon,really? i didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
38963,Sheldon,"leonard, the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. we have to do our part, too.  that was uncalled for, but i’ll play along. ow! i had an unusual experience with amy last night."
38964,Sheldon,she was attempting to engage me in gossip.
38972,Sheldon,why are you smiling?
38973,Sheldon,"oh, i’m back to trains. woo-woo."
38977,Sheldon,howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to bernadette.
38979,Sheldon,"i’m familiar with everything, but go on."
38984,Sheldon,"look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. you’re a vixen, amy farrah fowler."
38985,Sheldon,hey.
38988,Sheldon,yes. why do you ask?
38989,Sheldon,"did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
38995,Sheldon,this is remarkable. took less than 24 hours.
38996,Sheldon,"interesting. so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
39000,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in the shower?"
39010,Sheldon, penny?
39011,Sheldon,move. move. move!
39018,Sheldon,but…
39022,Sheldon,no.
39025,Sheldon,"thank you. if you think about it, greek food isn’t that far from italian food. they share a spice palette. and what a civilization is the greeks. they gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
39026,Sheldon, penny?
39028,Sheldon,"a girls night? oh, i don’t know if i’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
39047,Sheldon,thank you. is someone smoking?
39048,Sheldon,you own a smoking monkey?
39053,Sheldon,"priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
39062,Sheldon,"affirmative. computer, this is dr. sheldon cooper. activate self-destruct sequence. code 1-1-a-2-b."
39063,Sheldon,"that was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
39066,Sheldon,"he does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
39068,Sheldon,nine.
39085,Sheldon,that’s because it’s simple.
39101,Sheldon,"actually, i was wondering if i could add a third new chess piece. how do you think people would feel about prince joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
39104,Sheldon,fascinating. what’s in it?
39106,Sheldon,it was its own point. go on.
39115,Sheldon,when it’s done charging. or you land on the time machine. obviously.
39116,Sheldon,i knew i should have given my pope the jet pack.
39120,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, do i really need to connect the dots for you? the backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
39123,Sheldon,"oh, this is a nightmare!"
39124,Sheldon,"to the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. gang way! dead man walking!"
39126,Sheldon,fine. thank you for asking. i love you so much.
39130,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord!"
39136,Sheldon,jibber-jabber? i don’t jibber-jabber.
39142,Sheldon,i would think he would know that.
39144,Sheldon,a heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
39147,Sheldon,"i’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
39148,Sheldon,"howard, i have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
39149,Sheldon,"pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
39151,Sheldon,"this might be a good time to point out, howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. hold the door!"
39152,Sheldon,"no, i haven’t. it’s all good."
39155,Sheldon,"zandor, wizard of the north. ha! i win."
39157,Sheldon,it wouldn’help. the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
39160,Sheldon,"unless he takes bernadette’s last name. and considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
39165,Sheldon,still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
39173,Sheldon,"no, i can’t authorize that."
39181,Sheldon,"as your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. please sign."
39184,Sheldon,what is this?
39190,Sheldon,"no. origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
39191,Sheldon,here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
39203,Sheldon,it’s not what it looks like. it’s not what it looks like.
39207,Sheldon,oh. well don’t i look silly sitting here wearing this?
39208,Sheldon,"hey. leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
39210,Sheldon,"gentlemen, if i may interject, i’ve decided my rank will be captain. if it’s good enough for kirk, crunch and kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
39211,Sheldon,"for the record, i do have genitals. they’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
39212,Sheldon,"subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
39217,Sheldon,"all right, this is a google earth view of the field of battle."
39220,Sheldon,"this is a game to you? uh, was the battle of antietam a game? huh? was the sack of rome a game?"
39222,Sheldon,no. jamba juice is for heroes. and that’s what we’re going to be.
39223,Sheldon,"following in the footsteps of kirk, crunch and kangaroo. "
39228,Sheldon,it’s eight o’clock in the morning in mumbai. how can she have dinner?
39232,Sheldon,"oh, yes, priya. leonard, you know i make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
39237,Sheldon,don’t you like amy?
39265,Sheldon,"is not. is not, is not."
39266,Sheldon,thank you.
39271,Sheldon,cholera is water-borne. you’re mocking me.
39272,Sheldon,penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
39273,Sheldon,"all right, name your price."
39274,Sheldon,you mean like salt lake city?
39276,Sheldon,"no. i dislike the sound of the harp. its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think i’m going to experience an episode from my past.  i’m sorry, mommy. don’t be mad at me. don’t do that!"
39277,Sheldon,"penny, a moment. we just had thai food. in that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
39285,Sheldon,"okay, everybody calm down. there is a simple solution here. raj, take me to the train store, and then i don’t care what you people do."
39287,Sheldon,"i don’t want to talk about it. but it’s not a spine,i’ll tell you that."
39290,Sheldon,"all this years, i’ve been so wrong. the tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
39298,Sheldon,"the entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. you manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. what do you do?"
39299,Sheldon,"seventeen. the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. by the by, i liked it, too."
39301,Sheldon,"when you play chutes and ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
39305,Sheldon,"yes. from here on in, i’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. page 14, item seven."
39307,Sheldon,let’s see what i’ll be washing that succotash down with. a pitcher of margaritas.
39310,Sheldon,"and now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. bam! that’s what i’m talking about!"
39313,Sheldon,the dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
39314,Sheldon,"yeah, i actually have information about raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
39320,Sheldon,"can’t figure out what to do? i remember those days. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to…  stay right here."
39324,Sheldon,"well, off the top of my head, i’d have to go with excalibur. it gives you the right to rule england."
39326,Sheldon,"mm. tough decision. there’s no weaponry from lord of the rings, forged in a chinese sweatshop?"
39328,Sheldon,okay? it’s magnificent.
39335,Sheldon,"i’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
39337,Sheldon,it’s part of my sword collection. do you have a sword collection?
39338,Sheldon,i’m not surprised.
39345,Sheldon,"of course. now get it yourself, you traitor."
39349,Sheldon,that was a lovely toast. kudos.
39352,Sheldon,"would you prefer a simpler application of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which i could either know where you are or whether i like you, but not both?"
39355,Sheldon,"well, i started the list when i was nine."
39374,Sheldon,"well, mom, if i did, it would be conclusive proof that your god can work miracles."
39375,Sheldon,"frankly, mom, i’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
39384,Sheldon,"well, there’s actually big news on the amy front. she’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
39390,Sheldon,offer them a hot beverage.
39392,Sheldon,"i’m not going to get my pecan pie, am i?"
39403,Sheldon,"what do i say? i say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. stop it."
39407,Sheldon,"i’m not going, and you can’t make me."
39409,Sheldon,i can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
39414,Sheldon,"no. or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
39417,Sheldon,"oh, yes, the common cold. just like everyone else. you’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
39420,Sheldon,"i hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
39428,Sheldon,"or maybe i’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means i’m still basically a toddler."
39429,Sheldon,does this mean you’re not going to sing soft kitty?
39433,Sheldon,"and reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative i comma zero, and there we have it. conclusive proof that i am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
39440,Sheldon,"yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. you think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. well, you’ve forgotten one thing. i am also a son of the lone star state. i’m texas through and through. and we know how to settle scores down there. if you doubt me, ask mexico."
39446,Sheldon,"well, no, no, i need something more permanent to join these papers. say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
39448,Sheldon,it’s a snake. a terrifying snake.
39459,Sheldon,"on your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
39473,Sheldon,"what? no. you mean this was all a ruse? oh, how could i be so stu… ."
39480,Sheldon,can we? stand back while i turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
39483,Sheldon,"sorry. i’m a little distracted. i can’t seem to get in touch with amy. i tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
39491,Sheldon,would you like to talk about it? and keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
39493,Sheldon,"if you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
39495,Sheldon,"i knew it. just keep going, i guess i’m good at this."
39499,Sheldon,"counterproposal. i will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good amy."
39501,Sheldon,"very well. oh, boy. "
39512,Sheldon,"there’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. that is the hell that is going on. we have no worms or seeds here. shoo, shoo."
39513,Sheldon,"it’s called ornithophobia. and someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. which is unfortunate, because i have a fear of nets."
39515,Sheldon," go away, bird."
39518,Sheldon,"please, that’s a seagull. if you’re not going to help, don’t help."
39520,Sheldon,do you think it’s a date?
39527,Sheldon,"yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
39534,Sheldon,"oh, come now. your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
39537,Sheldon,every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. i’m not going to be another statistic.
39538,Sheldon,"i did it! i actually did it. okay, now flush him."
39539,Sheldon,"it’s remarkable. all that time spent in fear. and for what? he’s magnificent. oh, dear. i just realized i haven’t offered you a beverage."
39541,Sheldon,"yes. it should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? not anymore. we’re going to have so much fun together. you can carry messages to all my enemies. i can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
39545,Sheldon,"well? what do you think of new comic book night? magic, huh?"
39560,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s just play."
39579,Sheldon,i’m the guy.
39580,Sheldon,"are you sure? that would explain so much. your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
39582,Sheldon,"strap on a pair? of what, skates?"
39586,Sheldon,"stuart, please. you’re being rude."
39595,Sheldon,feel free to retain a lawyer.
39598,Sheldon,"relationship agreement section 4, boo-boos and ouchies. you have to take care of it."
39601,Sheldon,you asked penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
39603,Sheldon,"okay, penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. an e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to sweet georgia brown. pick."
39606,Sheldon,"was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
39610,Sheldon,nobel prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from stockholm.
39615,Sheldon,"oh, now perlmutter’s shaking the king’s hand. yeah, check for your watch, gustaf. he might have lifted it."
39627,Sheldon,"you’re being too kind, leonard. you ruined him."
39641,Sheldon,"oh, there it is, tacos."
39642,Sheldon,"i’m not going to say i told you so, but we could have killed him."
39644,Sheldon,"well said, boy wonder."
39647,Sheldon,"i don’t need to outrun him, i just need to outrun you."
39652,Sheldon,"coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. when i was five, billy sparks put a mexican peso up my nose."
39658,Sheldon,"yeah, me, too. triple digits, i’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
39661,Sheldon,"not much. although, i can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. i don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, i just melt inside."
39675,Sheldon,"well, that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it."
39678,Sheldon,"ooh, a pocket watch."
39682,Sheldon," trust me, we are not a couple."
39692,Sheldon,"as you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. but they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. so, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. i love my mind."
39694,Sheldon,"permission granted, commander."
39698,Sheldon,sarcasm?
39703,Sheldon,"and now that i have some wood, i’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
39716,Sheldon,"well, then, i guess it’s plausible. hang on a second, mister."
39717,Sheldon,"after you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
39720,Sheldon,it’s not about you. it’s about a poor immigrant from pakistan trying to make his way in america by working the graveyard shift at the colorado boulevard chevron.
39722,Sheldon,leonard will be here in a moment. he’s looking for a different parking space.
39725,Sheldon,"well, i doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
39727,Sheldon,i’ve got to go with leonard on this. he is wrong more than anyone i know.
39750,Sheldon,"well done, dr. koothrappali."
39753,Sheldon,kripke.
39768,Sheldon,"yeah, they have to, i’m a biter."
39798,Sheldon,"but candles? during a blackout? are you mad? that’s a fire hazard. no, pasadena water and power recommends the far safer glow stick."
39810,Sheldon,"counter-proposal. we reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of mother’s day or father’s day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. we could call it leonard’s day."
39813,Sheldon,no.
39814,Sheldon,no.
39823,Sheldon,ha. perfect. okay. get this. professor jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. five times the limit of e to the upsilon as in a 
39825,Sheldon,stop! i’m going to wet myself!
39832,Sheldon,"i’m sneaking into work. now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
39833,Sheldon,yes. that’s how velma and scooby smuggled shaggy into the old lighthouse.
39839,Sheldon,"it’s like i’m living in a dictatorship. you must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
39847,Sheldon,"what? excuse me, you have dr. sheldon cooper in your lab. you’re gonna make him do the dishes? that’s like asking the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar."
39849,Sheldon,here you go. this is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by carl sagan.
39854,Sheldon,you know what this place needs? a suggestion box.
39873,Sheldon,"i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory. after all, i did book the whole week."
39882,Sheldon,"mm, indeed."
39889,Sheldon,i’m sorry. we just need a word.
39890,Sheldon,we tried. his assistant said he was on sabbatical. although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
39899,Sheldon,you sure i can’t get you that cup of tea?
39904,Sheldon,"is he? well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. i’d smack you with a glove, but just last week i packed away my winter things."
39909,Sheldon,what do you propose?
39914,Sheldon,yeah. call first. 
39919,Sheldon,is it? listen.
39920,Sheldon,"no, i hate them, but it gets worse. there it is."
39951,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, i’m just here to get my hair cut."
39955,Sheldon,"no, i’m not all right. it’s been six days since i was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
39962,Sheldon,three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
39965,Sheldon,richard feynman played the bongos. i thought i’d give that a try.
39968,Sheldon,roommate agreement? are you kidding? we are living in a world of chaos. roommate agreement.
39971,Sheldon,"penny, you’re not trained. you’re not licensed. most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
39975,Sheldon,"at the end of the haircut, mr. d’onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
39977,Sheldon,"hmm, well, it’s a little hollywood. but i think i can pull it off. well done, penny."
39979,Sheldon,movies or video games? or board game? or trading card games? or lego’s? or dress up? or comic books? or dramatic readings of novelizations? yes to all!
39980,Sheldon,the online game? bully!
39981,Sheldon,just tell her i can’t come.
40003,Sheldon,"all right, then, i have no choice but to go on to plan b."
40004,Sheldon,i’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
40014,Sheldon,"oh, good. hah-hah!"
40018,Sheldon,armin who?
40019,Sheldon,"i think i understand. you’re the one person who can say sheldon cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. i forget what i bring to the party and what i take away when i leave. please accept these valuable cooper coupons as restitution."
40020,Sheldon,"well played, amy farrah fowler. let me get my coat.  oh, grow up, leonard."
40023,Sheldon,"yeah, i hate wedding receptions. i wish the bride and groom would take a cue from bilbo baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
40026,Sheldon,"well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
40031,Sheldon,"knock, knock."
40034,Sheldon,"ah! a vintage, mint in box, 1975 mego star trek transporter with real transporter action. hot-darn!"
40035,Sheldon,well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
40045,Sheldon,"well, i’m not going to dignify that with a response."
40061,Sheldon,mmmmm!
40068,Sheldon,"leonard, penny, i just, i want you both to know that i regret my actions toward the two of you. that’s a lie."
40073,Sheldon,"well, i believe i’ve done it. and i’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet sam houston, i did it."
40074,Sheldon,"oh, okay, let me see this. all right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. now, i was thinking… howard, you go ahead and eat. this isn’t going to make any sense to you."
40087,Sheldon,oh!
40095,Sheldon,"he will, he’s really smart."
40097,Sheldon,walking away.
40101,Sheldon,"great, thank you. oh, that’s terrific."
40110,Sheldon,and you want me to return it for you?
40114,Sheldon,those are howard’s.
40116,Sheldon,that’s close enough.
40118,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, condescending means…"
40119,Sheldon,"au contraire. when i correct people i am raising them up. you should know, i do it for you more than anyone."
40129,Sheldon,"oh, for heaven’s sake. i did your laundry, i pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, i, i even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
40130,Sheldon,okay.
40136,Sheldon,"all right, then. thank you, howard. please let professor hawking know that i’m available at his earliest convenience."
40139,Sheldon,i know.
40142,Sheldon,"no, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. i-i don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
40143,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no, of course not. it’s just, i was thinking… oh, gosh, golly, i made a boo-boo, and i gave it to stephen hawking."
40149,Sheldon,"well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
40155,Sheldon,oh. i guess you’re just friends with anybody.  aagh!
40162,Sheldon,here.
40167,Sheldon,you’re kidding. shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
40169,Sheldon,said the hangman offering a noose.
40172,Sheldon,keys! keys! keys!
40175,Sheldon,"i must say, i was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. as i mentioned, the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the lego store is having a midnight madness sale. you ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
40178,Sheldon,"oh, you brain monkeys kill me. dip away."
40181,Sheldon,super mario bros. theme?
40185,Sheldon,"i love strawberry quik. it’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out pepto-bismol."
40186,Sheldon,spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
40194,Sheldon,"it’s awful. this morning, she arranged for me to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day. it, it’s usually only open to children. she got them to make an exception."
40195,Sheldon,"they let me blow the whistle, leonard."
40204,Sheldon,"remarkable. in just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath howard’s keister. and all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been tetris and mail-order brides."
40205,Sheldon,"thank you for the invitation, but i have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something i’ll enjoy."
40207,Sheldon,"it does, indeed. leonard, is it awkward being here with penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
40218,Sheldon,"would you like some aloe vera? you just got burned. all right, my turn. howard, bernadette. daq tu’ tah daq yin tlhej ghajtah."
40219,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll do it in english, but it loses something. the need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. maybe because i’m so interesting all by myself. with that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own. the klingon would have made you cry."
40228,Sheldon,"yeah, wait, raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
40241,Sheldon,i just had cobbler.
40247,Sheldon,"good. now, i assume we’re splitting the cheque?"
40249,Sheldon,"2311 north los robles avenue, pasadena, california to international space station. can you read me? over. "
40251,Sheldon,i am talking to a man in space. if you don’t have the  then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street.
40260,Sheldon,"well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s raisinets."
40262,Sheldon,wolowitz went to mit. what’s your educational background?
40264,Sheldon,this insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
40265,Sheldon,"yeah, of course you do. you’re a girl. you like all kinds of hippy-dippy things."
40272,Sheldon,"now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?"
40276,Sheldon,"thank you. i appreciate that. you’re good people, leonard. there’s something i need to tell you."
40285,Sheldon,are you sleeping?
40289,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it."
40293,Sheldon,did you know that leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? hubba-hubba.
40295,Sheldon,"oh, very well. i can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. she told me that you were thinking of ending it with leonard."
40298,Sheldon,"my point is i don’t like when things change. so, regardless of your feelings, i would like you to continue dating leonard. and also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. i’m not comfortable with the new scent. please stop this madness and go back to green apple."
40303,Sheldon,"yeah, just a heads-up: penny knows that you blabbed about leonard. she’s pretty mad."
40306,Sheldon,"fairy god monster, i win. your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."
40311,Sheldon,call me a romantic. i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
40313,Sheldon,"oh, thank you, penny."
40315,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s journals and research papers i wrote as a child."
40332,Sheldon,"flattery will not get you this job, ms. jenson."
40333,Sheldon,"oh, well, thank you. welcome aboard."
40344,Sheldon,"it’s a kindness, leonard. otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."
40345,Sheldon,i believe alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the nobel prize. behold.
40350,Sheldon,"well, i don’t sell my friendship that cheaply."
40355,Sheldon,i know.
40356,Sheldon,"oh, that hardly seems fair. but i guess any team that i’m not on has a decided disadvantage."
40358,Sheldon,got it.
40359,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. now, how can you not get that?"
40361,Sheldon,it’s a quark-gluon plasma.
40365,Sheldon,"yeah, only after i eliminated all the obvious answers. you’re welcome."
40366,Sheldon,there.
40380,Sheldon,"well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. pool, beer pong, wet t-shirt contests, they’re all out."
40385,Sheldon,i’m okay. i’m okay. i’m not okay.
40389,Sheldon,"so, with all those antioxidants, what if i run out of oxidants?"
40394,Sheldon,"it’s fascinating. let me see if i can duplicate the result. howard, i’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. care to weigh in?"
40403,Sheldon,night of the living garlic bread?
40405,Sheldon,what are you smiling at?
40406,Sheldon,"a tardis makes no sense. it’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. it has nothing to do with halloween. that being said, if you don’t get a tardis, you stink and your party stinks."
40411,Sheldon,"look at that, the problem solved itself."
40416,Sheldon,it was a compromise. i lost.
40417,Sheldon,"paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. "
40422,Sheldon,"and if they ever come out with a game called words with people you once worked with, you’ll be off to the races."
40423,Sheldon,"hold that thought! professor hawking has made a move. boy, oh, boy. oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. i’ll be coop. he’ll be wheels. if he’s okay with that. "
40431,Sheldon,not challenging? i was humiliating the man. i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl.
40433,Sheldon,"good lord, what have i done?"
40435,Sheldon,trying to use a jedi mind trick to control stephen hawking. play. play. ugh! he must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
40447,Sheldon,it sucks to be you.
40452,Sheldon,you’re right. i guess i just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. he played! he played! coop and rolling thunder are together again. he was okay with that nickname.
40453,Sheldon,"yeah, way ahead of you. i will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."
40459,Sheldon,she sounds exactly like you.
40460,Sheldon,it’s stephen hawking.
40461,Sheldon,"professor hawking, how nice of you to call."
40462,Sheldon,"oh, me, too."
40464,Sheldon,"oh, i love brain teasers."
40466,Sheldon,what’s wrong?
40468,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
40470,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
40477,Sheldon,"come to think of it, i would! you, little lady, are on fire."
40484,Sheldon,you’re just repeating what i said. it’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
40485,Sheldon,"fine. it’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. i was this close."
40499,Sheldon,"it’s a band-aid at best. see, the core problem is that amy and wil do not like each other. which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. and i like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on star trek."
40514,Sheldon,"well, that was a long bus ride for not very much."
40517,Sheldon,"i don’t know what she’s talking about, but i’m obligated to agree with her. she’s my girlfriend."
40518,Sheldon,it’s a hypothetical containment field for a frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
40522,Sheldon,"no, thank you."
40523,Sheldon,i’m quite sure. good day.
40525,Sheldon,i just told you.
40526,Sheldon,"well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court."
40527,Sheldon,"to be honest, i didn’t know you were here."
40537,Sheldon,i thought you left a long time ago.
40540,Sheldon,"you don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know."
40542,Sheldon,"if a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. however, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. so, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on."
40546,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. that’s my spot.
40547,Sheldon,"well, i’m not using my nipples, either. maybe they should reassign those."
40554,Sheldon,"no, no, this is a slippery slope, leonard. it starts with a parking space, where does it end? it’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."
40563,Sheldon,get off there.
40570,Sheldon,"i think you’re high on paint fumes. and boy, that’s a lot of band-aids."
40579,Sheldon,"oh, preposterous. i have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, i have changed the way we think about bose-einstein condensates, and i am also the one who got nutter butters in the cafeteria vending machine. maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have work to do."
40583,Sheldon,"oh, of course, come in.  this is an authentic chinese throwing star, and i must warn you, i have seen many people throw them in movies."
40593,Sheldon,is that your son?
40597,Sheldon,"however, the spider-man lyrics posit that spider-man, spider-man does whatever a spider can."
40601,Sheldon,"actually, you can’t have that one either. it’s too good. sorry."
40605,Sheldon,"i’m not allowed to wear my silver surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
40608,Sheldon,"oh, no, i see the confusion. no, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when i’m ill. when you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny."
40615,Sheldon,"how can you sleep? i’m not done making you feel better. i still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply vaporub to your chest."
40621,Sheldon,fine. then i’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
40626,Sheldon,"in a perfect world, i’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. that probably requires a permit."
40632,Sheldon,excuse me. you’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
40638,Sheldon,"oh, where to begin? trees indoors. overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. and the absurd custom of one stocking. everyone knows socks belong in pairs. who uses one sock?"
40642,Sheldon,i signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
40654,Sheldon,melted snowmen? are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
40658,Sheldon,"yes. what, is there a problem?"
40662,Sheldon,"yeah, i’m familiar with your work. c-minus was your gift."
40663,Sheldon,all right. i think i cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
40672,Sheldon,"oh, i hope it’s a train."
40674,Sheldon,i’m getting three trains.
40675,Sheldon,"wait, uh, uh, hang on. in my defense…"
40676,Sheldon,"well, i must say, leonard, when i first heard your idea for giant jenga, i was sceptical."
40679,Sheldon,"jenga, i win!"
40680,Sheldon,"ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?"
40683,Sheldon,"i want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. uh, in the past, i’ve reached out to each of you individually, but i believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative t-shirts i have dubbed sheldon cooper’s council of ladies."
40691,Sheldon,"well, what should i do?"
40695,Sheldon,"well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?"
40697,Sheldon,"you don’t know? oh, you poor dear. your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. you made an inappropriate sexual advance towards dr. hofstadter."
40704,Sheldon,"good to know. yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the council of ladies.  hello. i see. uh, what time? very well, then. huh. that was the human resources department at the university. apparently, my assistant alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace."
40711,Sheldon,"oh! i see the confusion here. no, no, alex thought i was singling her out. no. i meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? even you. you’re a slave."
40716,Sheldon,"actually, i came to speak to mrs. davis."
40717,Sheldon,but i came to file a complaint. somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
40726,Sheldon,"it’s a comic book convention. you know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good."
40727,Sheldon,i think you should turn on the gps.
40729,Sheldon,"ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. i’d put on my listening ears if i were you."
40735,Sheldon,none of you will get it. it’s eisenhower.
40738,Sheldon,stealing is against the law!
40742,Sheldon,maybe we’re better off. what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
40743,Sheldon,"well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."
40745,Sheldon,all right.
40747,Sheldon,"leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. and look at us. at this moment, we are, in fact, a star trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. as long as we have those things, nothing can stop…"
40748,Sheldon,i hate this planet.
40751,Sheldon,"actually, it’s three against one."
40752,Sheldon,"yeah, well, we’re not. we’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. and to tell you the truth, i’m starting to feel like one. i want to go home now."
40758,Sheldon,would it come with kung-fu grip?
40766,Sheldon,tea is for when i’m upset. i’m not upset. the university’s forcing me to work with kripke. i’m outraged.
40771,Sheldon,why don’t you show me yours first.
40772,Sheldon,how do i know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
40774,Sheldon,fine.
40779,Sheldon,yes.
40782,Sheldon,i feel like i’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. why’d you stop?
40795,Sheldon,"because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. anyway, if kripke asks, tell him my coitus with amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive."
40796,Sheldon,of course.
40801,Sheldon,it’s a possibility.
40802,Sheldon,fine.
40805,Sheldon,"no, i gave it to her well. now, over here, i was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…"
40806,Sheldon,i didn’t notice.
40816,Sheldon,"what? i’m annoying? you criticize my behaviour all the time. sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. you’re impossible."
40817,Sheldon,"actually, i have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do."
40819,Sheldon,"roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the american flag, cannot touch the ground."
40820,Sheldon,where are you going?
40821,Sheldon,crazy bastard?
40822,Sheldon,"leonard, wait."
40823,Sheldon,dobby the elf dies in book seven.
40829,Sheldon,exactly.
40834,Sheldon,um…
40836,Sheldon, good buddy leonard.
40841,Sheldon,"feelings? what am i, a hippie at a love-in? no. the problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that i couldn’t refute."
40843,Sheldon,um…
40844,Sheldon,"hello, home wrecker."
40845,Sheldon,"you gave leonard somewhere to go. thanks to you, amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. like i’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it."
40854,Sheldon,"yes. amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"
40855,Sheldon,"yeah, why would you?"
40857,Sheldon,we’re not home right now.
40861,Sheldon,it’s penny’s fault.
40863,Sheldon,"i said the truth. you don’t want to live with leonard, and you know it."
40867,Sheldon,do you want to catch up on some walking dead?
40869,Sheldon,or maybe she doesn’t. let’s find out.
40871,Sheldon,"oh, you caught that, did you?"
40875,Sheldon,"okay. amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. dazzle me. go."
40878,Sheldon,next.
40879,Sheldon,mmm.
40888,Sheldon,what is that?
40895,Sheldon,"well, i thought, if i have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would i want to share that with?"
40896,Sheldon,"it’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend."
40898,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. my apologies that this episode is coming late. i did shoot one last week, in honour of black history month, but i was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of george washington carver could be considered wildly racist. my heart goes out to the members of the african-american community, who, like me, have been kept down by the man. now, fun with flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. she’s had coitus many times. sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. once while he was trying to watch the incredibles. penny."
40906,Sheldon,hello. how’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
40910,Sheldon,why would i do that?
40915,Sheldon,"yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and i found your suggestions extremely helpful."
40920,Sheldon,"oh, so many crazy rules."
40924,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, more rules? where does it stop? can i want to go because i have to want to go?"
40925,Sheldon,"yeah, but now, wait. do whatever i want? or whatever i have to want?"
40933,Sheldon,"it’s about streetcars? oh, great. i won’t need this. "
40937,Sheldon,i got the b word.
40940,Sheldon,i’m not saying people can’t use tools. even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
40945,Sheldon,we’re not. this time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
40949,Sheldon,all your ideas address the issue at a university level. by then it’s too late. you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
40953,Sheldon,"this must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut."
