24763,Penny,"all right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up."
24766,Penny,"i’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it."
24768,Penny,"okay, it’s not a movie. it’s improv. so no one calls action."

24889,Penny,"you know, i gotta tell you, i think you got a real winner with priya."
24899,Penny,"he was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his spiderman underwear. that’s our lenny, huh?"
24907,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake, leonard, this is about priya, isn’t it? she doesn’t want me hanging out with you."
24908,Penny,"okay, look, i happen to like your girlfriend."
24911,Penny,you can hear my toilet flush?
24912,Penny,"leonard, i get it. you’re in a new relationship now. and i’m happy for you. so why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?"
24929,Penny,"no, but i can name all the kardashians."
24935,Penny,"well, doesn’t matter if she gets it, as long as she’s pretty."
24942,Penny,"oh, hi."
24944,Penny,fine. you?
24946,Penny,amy’s right. i do want to fling my poop at her.
24953,Penny,"priya told you. what a little gossip. you know, not an attractive quality in a woman, leonard. not judging, just my opinion."
24954,Penny,"you don’t have to worry. unlike amy and priya, i know how to keep a secret."
24956,Penny,"oh, hey, amy. what’s up?"
24977,Penny,did you take dance lessons?
24985,Penny,screw it. i’ll go later.
24987,Penny,"okay, amy, you’re being silly. i am not concerned about who hangs out with who. and i certainly don’t have a problem with leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. ooh, these are cute. of course if i buy them, i’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
24988,Penny,wait. what are you talking about?
24990,Penny,"no. once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and i’ll have to wear them walking up and down hollywood boulevard in order to pay them off. pretty, pretty, pretty."
24992,Penny,hey. seriously? didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
24994,Penny,wh… what the hell did she say?
25006,Penny,hey.
25012,Penny,"alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber."
25013,Penny,"oh, my god, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."
25014,Penny,"oh, my god! what happened?"
25024,Penny,how else is she supposed to take it?
25025,Penny,"well, he’s my friend. it’s what you do. "
25026,Penny,"it’s just so weird. howard wolowitz is my friend. you know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and i broke his nose."
25035,Penny,yeah.
25038,Penny,"yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. do not believe it."
25041,Penny,"yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. it helps, but everything is not peachy."
25052,Penny,"really? even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
25070,Penny,"yeah, i’m gonna go pack a bag."
25072,Penny,"i know, right? maybe i should just move back to nebraska."
25077,Penny,"oh. gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…"
25084,Penny,oh!
25095,Penny,"hey, what you doing, quick draw?"
25098,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe teach acting.  oh, sorry. hold on. hello?"
25100,Penny,"oh, hell with nebraska. i’m gonna be a star!"
25106,Penny,what name?
25107,Penny,"oh, all right, well, i’m glad you like it. i mean, i still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away."
25112,Penny,yello.
25120,Penny,no. 
25125,Penny,and what’s that?
25128,Penny,"my god, amy, that’s really crappy of you."
25129,Penny,yeah! letting sheldon use you to manipulate me? i thought you were my friend.
25133,Penny,"ooh, me."
25149,Penny,"oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. we should set him up with someone."
25150,Penny,"well, hello? she’s married."
25152,Penny,"um, howard, can i see you for a minute, please?"
25153,Penny,"uh, no, that’s not it. just come with me, please."
25160,Penny,"oh, of course not. she wouldn’t do something like that. she’s deaf."
25165,Penny,"okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car."
25174,Penny,"we didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. and hey, since when are you so chatty?"
25177,Penny,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
25179,Penny,he is cuter now that i know he’s rich.
25181,Penny,"oh, i’m so sorry. i wish i could make you feel better."
25189,Penny,"oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
25191,Penny,"okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
25210,Penny,want some mac and cheese?
25212,Penny,"okay, well, i’d offer you halloween candy, but that’s gone. so, what’s up?"
25213,Penny,"oh, my god, that’s where i know you from."
25218,Penny,"yeah, probably."
25221,Penny,"oh, look at you, you bad boy. did you tell her about priya?"
25226,Penny,"if you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with priya?"
25242,Penny,"well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
25252,Penny,"yeah, sure, sure. vegas is fun, too."
25258,Penny,hey.
25275,Penny,"but come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
25297,Penny,"yes, he is. with his dorky t-shirt and his little hipster glasses."
25298,Penny,"yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically."
25301,Penny,hey. sorry i ditched you.
25312,Penny,"okay, i’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
25327,Penny,"hello, sheldon. come on in."
25329,Penny,"i’m sorry, what?"
25336,Penny,"look, sheldon, all i’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to amy."
25341,Penny,basketball pope.
25344,Penny,hmm. that’s too bad. we could have spent new year’s eve waiting for the ball to drop.
25350,Penny,oh. i don’t know. i guess my school was a nice place. we didn’t really have bullies.
25354,Penny,what? i was not a bully.
25357,Penny,that’s easy for you to say. you weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
25371,Penny,look at us. what are we doing?
25372,Penny,"you know, this is wrong. let’s put everything back. here."
25377,Penny,"sheldon, what is wrong with you?"
25378,Penny,"okay, amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
25383,Penny,"still saying stupid stuff. ooh, does she like bracelets?"
25384,Penny," trust me, we are not a couple."
25387,Penny,"ooh, are these real diamonds?"
25389,Penny,"i said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"
25390,Penny,hi.
25391,Penny,"okay, he wants to talk to you."
25392,Penny,"sheldon, you’re up."

25395,Penny,"why, you guys going somewhere?"
25399,Penny,"okay, just hang on."
25404,Penny,"yeah, okay, no."
25406,Penny,what?
25409,Penny,"amy, stop it. oh, god, i’m so nervous."
25411,Penny,"oh, that’s a good question. how about awkward?"
25413,Penny,okay.
25420,Penny,"leonard, this is nice. i’m so glad we did this."
25424,Penny,so?
25428,Penny,"yes, you are. you always overthink things."
25431,Penny,do not overthink this.  
25436,Penny,so what do you want to do now?
25437,Penny,"i don’t know, it’s complicated."
25440,Penny,"come on, be serious."
25445,Penny,"here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. you need menus or you know what you want?"
25450,Penny,you know what? i just realized i’m on a break. i’ll get someone else.
25460,Penny,that was a really nice dinner. i’m glad you asked me out again.
25463,Penny,"okay, well, maybe not that slow."
25467,Penny,all right. let’s give it a shot.
25468,Penny,"okay. good night, leonard."
25478,Penny,it’s open.
25479,Penny,"yeah, hang on. let me just finish this chapter."
25481,Penny,two weeks to rock hard abs.
25486,Penny,"okay, bug report. i just complimented you. you should take it and shut up."
25489,Penny,wow. you are cute when you get all gangsta. 
25491,Penny,"well, thank you for a really cool evening."
25493,Penny,"good night, you."
25495,Penny,"sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do i know?"
25499,Penny,"you know, in girl scouts, tammie dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. boy, was she wrong. anyway, you want to make out?"
25503,Penny,but he’s sad.
25505,Penny,"hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
25507,Penny,i’m so glad you talked howard out of having your wedding invitations in klingon.
25508,Penny,why wouldn’t you?
25512,Penny,"hey, you."
25516,Penny,"i think about a lot of things. i think about us getting married, i think about us breaking up. once in a while, i think about how i didn’t leave a note on that mercedes i dinged in the parking lot last month, but then i have a glass of wine and it passes."
25528,Penny,"oh, my god. hang it. wow. um, you know, i’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…"
25529,Penny,"oh, look. you, huh, you just, you got it all right there. wow."
25540,Penny,"sure, sure. enjoy. i mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. it’s just going to be my gift to you. bye."
25543,Penny,"no. no, no. it’s just, it’s a little big."
25544,Penny,"no, come on, you’re not an idiot. look, just help me put it back up."
25545,Penny,"oh, amy, come on."
25557,Penny,well where are we going?
25558,Penny,"well, what about bernadette?"
25562,Penny,mm.
25563,Penny,"yeah, good call."
25565,Penny,"you know, sheldon, i used to cut my brother’s hair. i could do it for you."
25566,Penny,"so, if i move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and i win?"
25567,Penny,"well, is it or isn’t it?"
25568,Penny,"well, no, i mean, your king is trapped. he can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy."
25570,Penny,"oh, hey. sorry, sheldon, i’ll move."
25572,Penny,"uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
25574,Penny,"you know, sh-sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. i mean, look at me and leonard. we went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. we don’t know what’s gonna happen."
25575,Penny,"if i were you, i’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
25577,Penny,"oh, leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. i don’t care if richard feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
25579,Penny,"all right, sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. please come home so i can cut your hair."
25592,Penny,an acting choice.
25595,Penny,gummy bears? thank you.
25608,Penny,"well, sickly is the new sexy."
25609,Penny,"mm. you know, amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
25610,Penny,that’s hilarious. no.
25620,Penny,"that’s why you’re lucky to have me. back in omaha, there are two different restaurants i’m not allowed into. both chili’s."
25622,Penny,"ooh, burn!"
25624,Penny,"no, sheldon hurt you."
25625,Penny,oh.
25628,Penny,i’ll let you hold my hair while i throw up.
25642,Penny,c’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
25647,Penny,what is your problem?
25651,Penny,"i didn’t break it. i, i guess stuart sold it to me like this."
25653,Penny,what is the truth?
25654,Penny,mmm.
25655,Penny,hey.
25666,Penny,"fine, howard is being mean to you for no reason."
25669,Penny,"oh, come on leonard, it’s you. what’s going to happen? i mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
25673,Penny,"yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
25677,Penny,"oh, that’s cool."
25678,Penny,"amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?"
25682,Penny,"well, i was gonna, but i didn’t think it would go past the first date. then, when it did, i thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. i mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
25684,Penny,amy.
25700,Penny,mm-hmm.
25701,Penny,"you know, just-just one thing. look, we’re in a really great place right now, and i don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
25702,Penny,"okay. oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, i got a cookie monster tattoo. the acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
25709,Penny,it’s not funny.
25713,Penny,"yeah, i’ve been thinking about it, too."
25719,Penny,it wasn’t a real proposal.
25722,Penny,"yeah, i mean, not to the same people but…"
25724,Penny,"okay, i’ll, i’ll go. howard and bernadette, i know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. it just matters that you have each other."
25727,Penny,"well, he started it."
25729,Penny,"i can’t believe it. this whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying."
25730,Penny,"hey, this is my natural hair colour. now. so, does sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?"
25746,Penny,"yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?"
25759,Penny,"well, i do."
25770,Penny,sheldon.
25785,Penny,"look, there’s something i need to tell you."
25790,Penny,"look, it’s fine. we’re not getting married, okay? we’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis."
25793,Penny,"oh, boy, a whole dollar. now, i can quit my paper route. so, what’s in it?"
25796,Penny,"august 7, 8:42 a.m. this is humiliating. what was wrong with diapers?"
25804,Penny,"a proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. i’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t i?"
25805,Penny,"okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. you just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."
25825,Penny,in a way. we’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
25826,Penny,"well, a lot of people can’t. uh, hey."
25832,Penny,"okay. ready, set, go."
25834,Penny,"oh, my god, we’re gonna kill them."
25842,Penny,"i wonder if it’s from, like, ancient rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. you know, to appease loseroneous, the god of losers."
25860,Penny,"well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. isn’t that, like, his job?"
25863,Penny,"yeah, that’s kind of a problem."
25865,Penny,"yeah, i’m not really clear on what that means."
25872,Penny,"what, is it secret?"
25873,Penny,oh. you might want to put a sign on it.
25874,Penny,"ah. danger. sure, sure. yeah. what’s, what’s that?"
25888,Penny,whoa! that is very cool.
25899,Penny,"because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can i help?” and “i’m so proud of you.” ugh!"
25900,Penny,really? you can’t think of anyone weirder?
25916,Penny,so let me get this straight. you just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
25939,Penny,"and for the record, bleugh. so what are you drinking?"
25942,Penny,"oh. so, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?"
25947,Penny,"come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. i thought you texas guys stood up for your womenfolk."
25950,Penny,"yeah, that she is. here you go."
25957,Penny,"would you stop? look, he just moved here from london, okay? he doesn’t really know anybody."
25959,Penny,it didn’t come up.
25968,Penny,"hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"
25969,Penny,i just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
25977,Penny,"uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax."
25981,Penny,"you know, i remember the first time i got a bikini wax. my sister did it with melted crayolas and duct tape. it’s a bad idea."
25987,Penny,"you idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!"
25989,Penny,thanks. ah!
25991,Penny,"guys, i think i need to go to the emergency room."
26008,Penny,really? that’s how you’re gonna spend your saturday night?
26017,Penny,"of course he is. look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. she’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is slumdog millionaire. i mean."
26018,Penny,"so, how’d it go?"
26020,Penny,"oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them."
26021,Penny,"oh, come on, raj, not even a little bit?"
26022,Penny,what?
26032,Penny,mm-hmm. anything else?
26033,Penny,that’s great.
26040,Penny,"i don’t care about alex. fine, i care. okay, i hate that bitch. but what really hurt is that you liked it so much. i mean, do i need to be worried?"
26045,Penny,"well, i do."
26048,Penny,can i tell you a secret?
26050,Penny,what did you do?
26053,Penny,"no, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. i mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? anyway, i decided i don’t need to be a scientist, i could just look like one. so i bought these."
26056,Penny,hi. here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
26064,Penny,"oh, this is the best. you have booze with breakfast on a tuesday, you got a problem. you do it on the weekend, you got brunch."
26065,Penny,i know. the four of them work at a major university. they’re all super smart. how can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
26075,Penny,"yeah, well, i have street smarts."
26076,Penny,mmm.
26081,Penny,"okay, hang on, what if thor’s hand is on the hammer? i mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean i could lift it?"
26083,Penny,okay.
26085,Penny,yes!
26087,Penny,"if harry potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t thor’s hammer?"
26094,Penny,"honey, if you want one, just get one."
26097,Penny,what is that?
26099,Penny,what beverage do you make for that?
26100,Penny,"all right, i don’t understand. why didn’t you just tell kripke the truth?"
26113,Penny,"um, well, um, all right. you, you know how in harry potter and the half-blood prince, ron didn’t abandon harry just because harry started dating ron’s sister?"
26116,Penny,"no. no, no, i do. i do. it’s just, i mean, it’s a really big step."
26124,Penny,"yes. that is a real thing. and it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine."
26149,Penny,hey.
26152,Penny,"oh, son of a bitch."
26158,Penny,"you know what, screw them. our night is going to be way more special than theirs."
26160,Penny,get up.
26167,Penny,"yeah, well, whatever, okay? i told you, valentine’s day sucks."
26172,Penny,i don’t know. maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and i’ve been really happy.
26178,Penny,"okay. you know what? this might be the wine talking, but i have a very important question to ask you."
26187,Penny,"um, well, i’m from nebraska. so what can you tell me about the state flag?"
26195,Penny,"hey, i don’t want you to go any more."
26201,Penny,"yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. it’s a joke. based on real events."
26202,Penny,"so, blow off work, go on a weekday."
26210,Penny,"all right, whatever. how does it work?"
26211,Penny,guess it would be fun to be cinderella.
26217,Penny,what is your point?
26223,Penny,okay.
26228,Penny,why do you even care? just tell us what it says.
26231,Penny,"yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful."
26237,Penny,"it was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave."
26250,Penny,"oh, what a jerk."
26258,Penny,"uh, sheldon, there are two dumplings left. do you want them?"
26272,Penny,"okay, help me out here. why does he love this show so much?"
26283,Penny,"leonard, i had an epiphany, not a stroke."
26286,Penny,"eh, his giant head did most of the work."
26289,Penny,"aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. like when kids say pasghetti."
26302,Penny,we’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
26304,Penny,no.
26311,Penny,"oh, this isn’t alcohol. it’s a magic potion that makes me like you."
26314,Penny,"yeah, well i’m supposed to be in vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. now give it. all right, what do i need?"
26330,Penny,"oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. no. i mean, look, you have to go. it sounds like an amazing opportunity. and i’m just basing that on how much i didn’t understand what you said about it."
26332,Penny,sure.
26342,Penny,"oh, my god, sheldon the genius is jealous of leonard."
26344,Penny,"it wasn’t me. but she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. she got it. look, i was so jealous. but instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…"
26374,Penny,no.
26375,Penny,why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with leonard and you miss him?
26389,Penny,"leonard, leonard? i cannot believe we were missing that jerk."
26398,Penny,"well, now i miss him even more."
26402,Penny,"no. come on, let’s talk about our lives. tell me something about you i don’t know."
26404,Penny,how about i go first?
26409,Penny,"okay, you know what? i give up. i’m going to bed."
26414,Penny,come on.
26415,Penny,aaaaaaah!
26417,Penny,"well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere."
26423,Penny,"oh, that is so romantic."
26427,Penny,thank you.
26432,Penny,"yeah, thanks, but i kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…"
26437,Penny,"oh. well, you know, i, i’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."
26444,Penny,what the hell?
26447,Penny,it was fine.
26452,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
26454,Penny,sheldon.
26457,Penny,fifty cents off vagisil.
26462,Penny,"mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think i’m smart enough. you think i’m gonna be a liability. even though i totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. yeah."
26466,Penny,no.
26472,Penny,"ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up."
26477,Penny,"oh. okay. sheldon, i, i’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"
26485,Penny,what? why me?
26490,Penny,"yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause i’m still gonna beat your ass."
26506,Penny,"okay, i know you don’t want to talk about it, but can i just ask you one question about your mom’s book?"
26507,Penny,i just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
26522,Penny,"oh, just a little treat. i know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
26524,Penny,bernadette told me everything. now you don’t get the left or the right.
26530,Penny,that’s different. i’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
26536,Penny,"nope, got to go with amy on this one."
26540,Penny,"uh, sheldon, you want to take a break? your food’s ready."
26550,Penny,"okay, good, ’cause i’ve been really struggling with this."
26552,Penny,"i don’t know if i want to cook for him. he’s kind of a picky eater. i mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
26556,Penny,"yeah, i’m trying to be sad about that. i can’t."
26558,Penny,"okay, you know what’s not romantic? rubbing it in someone’s face."
26560,Penny,what?
26563,Penny,yes. the most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
26565,Penny,it’s a first edition of hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy. i remember it was your favourite book growing up.
26579,Penny,what’s going on with them?
26581,Penny,"ooh, that looks like fun."
26585,Penny,"sorry, they’re both married."
26591,Penny,"aw, did she hate you?"
26594,Penny,"yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
26597,Penny,i’m gonna go talk to her.
26598,Penny,i’m not gonna say anything. i just want to check her out. because she hurt my friend. my indian friend. who’s racist now?
26600,Penny,"hey, can i start you off with something to drink?"
26606,Penny,"you know what the worst part is? you’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess."
26610,Penny,"well, i was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, i want to say salmon."
26622,Penny,"oh, stop it. i’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
26627,Penny,"uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
26628,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
26633,Penny,"no, they’re not."
26641,Penny,here. thank you for having us.
26646,Penny,"ugh, i need some air."
26652,Penny,okay.
26654,Penny,"okay, look, zack, come on. you know neither of us thought this was real. i mean, we were married by an elvis impersonator."
26655,Penny,"hang on. you know what? you have been a jerk about this all day. you always do this, whenever i mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it."
26656,Penny,"yeah, we could’ve waited till monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
26667,Penny,bark once if you need me to call peta.
26669,Penny,you’re probably right.
26678,Penny,okay.
26681,Penny,"hey, how’s your sister?"
26683,Penny,"hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? not being born?"
26687,Penny,a few minutes it is.
26691,Penny,i think you’re too late.
26693,Penny,why? 
26694,Penny,hey. did you remember to pay the rent?
26696,Penny,"me, too."
26702,Penny,"okay, that’s enough."
26703,Penny,"so, what do you think?"
26704,Penny,"please, sheldon. i need you."
26707,Penny,i think i know how to change your mind.
26708,Penny,great.
26712,Penny,who’s that?
26714,Penny,"i’m sorry, i have a boyfriend. in fact, there he is now. ready to go, sweetheart?"
26716,Penny,i just got a part on a tv show.
26717,Penny,"um, nc… ii… or, you know, ncstd… i don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and i’m gonna be on it!"
26723,Penny,we haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
26732,Penny,unbelievable.
26733,Penny,then what did you mean?
26744,Penny,"and you didn’t get your part cut. yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!"
26745,Penny,"we can, but the part of penny might get cut."
26746,Penny,thank you.
26747,Penny,are you serious? for what?
26749,Penny,"come on leonard, this is just a pr stunt."
26756,Penny,"no, it’s not, okay? i’ve been out here for, like, ten years. i’ve nothing to show for it."
26763,Penny,"no, no, i just need to be alone."
26767,Penny,leonard…
26780,Penny,"come on, boy. come on. let’s go. let’s go. get in the car. come on."
26788,Penny,really?
26795,Penny,"sheldon, take a break."
26801,Penny,"you keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it."
26810,Penny,what? you were all going as the hulk?
26813,Penny,"yeah, but those tickets only get him into comic-con. that dress gets me into anywhere i want."
26815,Penny,"oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, i should probably put on clean underwear."
26816,Penny,"no, we’re gonna stop at target on the way."
26819,Penny,"so, afternoon tea was a bust."
26822,Penny,"i know. one of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. i mean, i, i almost wet myself. i guess you had to be there."
26823,Penny,"okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
26825,Penny,"i mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?"
26829,Penny,that would really piss me off if i didn’t have a buzz going on.
26834,Penny,don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. it came that way when i bought it.
26840,Penny,yeah.
26845,Penny,a whole box.
26860,Penny,"hi. sorry i’m late, i was at an audition."
26867,Penny,why not?
26873,Penny,"give it a chance, sheldon, you might actually like it."
26874,Penny,"well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot."
26888,Penny,"sheldon, amy, will you please come join us?"
26890,Penny,"forget it, leonard. it’s over."
26895,Penny,"well, i don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career."
26897,Penny,"oh, i’m sure he does it out of love. the same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices."
26899,Penny,"remember the old days when i would’ve said something dumb like why? uh, that doesn’t sound good."
26901,Penny,"yeah, i know it’s on, sheldon. oh, no, no, no, no, no. i cannot afford this right now."
26910,Penny,it’s just so humiliating.
26919,Penny,"oh, my god."
26925,Penny,"sorry. hey, who’s not the murderer?"
26926,Penny,"ooh, i’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
26927,Penny,"okay, can i ask you something? why do you like making us do this stuff?"
26930,Penny,"hey, i’m a famous actress living in london."
26931,Penny,hmm.
26933,Penny,"yeah, but if i become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money."
26935,Penny,really? you think i’m putting this body through three kids?
26939,Penny,that’s so sweet.
26942,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t pout. i’m sorry i ruined your game."
26951,Penny,"yeah, sure."
26958,Penny,i don’t know what to do.
26965,Penny,both of us.
26973,Penny,"come on, really?"
26975,Penny,i wouldn’t exactly call star trek embarrassing.
26981,Penny,great. not like regret at all.
26982,Penny,"hey, you’re up early."
26983,Penny,i told you those walking dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
26992,Penny,"i know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow."
26993,Penny,"so, how do you want me to cut it?"
27018,Penny,no. bernadette’s working late.
27023,Penny,you’re not working late. why did you lie to me?
27043,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake. look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
27045,Penny,"oh, oh, here we go."
27048,Penny,"sheldon, do you hear that? i mean, amy is the key to your happiness."
27051,Penny,"so, when is it?"
27064,Penny,i feel like i want to cry.
27068,Penny,it was a gift. thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
27072,Penny,what would you regret?
27076,Penny,"well, it just wasn’t the right time."
27081,Penny,okay. fine. would you feel better if i propose so you could turn me down again?
27097,Penny,"actually, you know what? can we do one more? i think i could do it better."
27098,Penny,"well, i care. i mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?"
27100,Penny,what? you can’t fire me. i’m the star. i’m the girl that goes bananas. it says so on the poster.
27103,Penny,"all right, i’m sorry, you’re famous."
27104,Penny,"god, what am i doing with my life?"
27117,Penny,"well, yeah."
27126,Penny,"yeah, i think so."
27135,Penny,"well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but i figure at some point, i’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me."
27147,Penny,"oh, i’m sure he’s fine."
27154,Penny,we were worried about you.
27155,Penny,and go where?
27163,Penny,mm.
27170,Penny,"i can’t, i have that job interview."
27172,Penny,nope.
27174,Penny,i don’t have any experience in sales. unless you count the bikini car wash i did in high school. but you already made me take that off my résumé.
27180,Penny,they’re comfortable.
27183,Penny,"uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. i mean, believe me, i convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. i mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump."
27186,Penny,"okay, thanks. um, i’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell bernadette how badly i blew this interview? she’ll get upset. and honestly i’m a, a little terrified of her."
27187,Penny,"yeah, kind of."
27191,Penny,"oh, my god, no."
27197,Penny,i said i’ll get to it.
27200,Penny,hey. ready to go to lunch?
27203,Penny,"well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me."
27206,Penny,"well, you saw her the other night. am i wrong?"
27208,Penny,"so, what are you saying?"
27209,Penny,what?
27217,Penny,"okay, this is not what i meant when i said go outside and play."
27226,Penny,"sheldon, i’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub."
27235,Penny,"well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships."
27250,Penny,can he really throw a ball?
27251,Penny,"yeah, that’s a no."
27255,Penny,i don’t know. i kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
27258,Penny,"yeah. you’re probably right. i used to think my high school p.e. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much."
27261,Penny,yeah.
27263,Penny,thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. i really appreciate it.
27264,Penny,"um, i brought coffee. i wasn’t sure what you like, so i got a regular, a cappuccino and a chai tea. since you like raj, i thought you might be into that."
27272,Penny,"well, i wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up."
27273,Penny,yeah.
27275,Penny,no. yeah.
27286,Penny,what?
27290,Penny,why are you asking me?
27294,Penny,"oh, thank you for coming."
27309,Penny,no.
27324,Penny,yep. shake that thing.
27325,Penny,"good morning. you want to go to the pool? come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. wow, it’s bright out. isn’t it bright? i should probably close these curtains. nah. bye."
27328,Penny,"okay, good."
27329,Penny,"wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?"
27330,Penny,you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
27335,Penny,"yeah. and there’s your money back, and now we’re even. how great is that?"
27337,Penny,"oh, come on, leonard, i know the car was a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both."
27338,Penny,what should i have done? taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
27341,Penny,why?
27344,Penny,"okay, i don’t want this to turn into a fight."
27345,Penny,"great. thank you. can you pass the salt, please?"
27347,Penny,"oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
27349,Penny,mm.
27380,Penny,"please, yes."
27385,Penny,"okay. whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. you got to get rid of him."
27386,Penny,"i can’t do it, he’s my best client."
27387,Penny,dr. lorvis?
27389,Penny,"doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy."
27390,Penny,"okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you."
27395,Penny,"leonard, are you okay?"
27396,Penny,"okay, leonard, let’s go."
27407,Penny,no. i just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
27417,Penny,"okay, just one question. what?"
27420,Penny,you’re kidding.
27425,Penny,"well, who’d you go with?"
27429,Penny,"what, that already happened?"
27435,Penny,"i know, me, too. but it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
27453,Penny,"yeah, ’cause you sound really funny."
27461,Penny,come on. she’s not that bad.
27475,Penny,even though your dress is ugly.
27487,Penny,"oh, that’s rough."
27488,Penny,"oh, great. everything’s good."
27500,Penny,so erase them and walk out.
27506,Penny,did you say it out loud with words?
27512,Penny,"all right, let’s see. what’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? oh, i know, we could go horseback riding."
27513,Penny,"all right, well, what do you want to do?"
27515,Penny,"three words, doctor who convention."
27519,Penny,how come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
27521,Penny,"it does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it."
27522,Penny,"no, you’re right, we should do what you do. have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston."
27523,Penny,bye.
27527,Penny,"well, you know, that was a long time ago. you’re a different woman now. you’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want."
27530,Penny,how are you guys getting along? what? why are there tears?
27531,Penny,"sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready."
27540,Penny,"i love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one."
27541,Penny,"ugh, what?"
27543,Penny,"i don’t know, i guess i like that i hate it. it makes me work harder."
27555,Penny,"wow, this is hard. i’m gonna say cinnamon."
27560,Penny,"yeah, you get some sleep."
27566,Penny,kind of like sheldon’s ant farm.
27567,Penny,"no, i do. i didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing."
27568,Penny,"hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, i’d keep it moving."
27571,Penny,"what, no, why?"
27575,Penny,"okay, we’ve seen plenty."
27576,Penny,"okay, well, i’ve been poking around the internet, and i think i found something we’ll enjoy watching even more."
27578,Penny,you look like a talking cupcake.
27582,Penny,okay. we are reading that right now.
27593,Penny,"with a heavy heart, amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. she regretted giving cooper the part he needed."
27595,Penny,"no, it is. does he stay? do they kiss? does she find out about montana?"
27597,Penny,get out!
27599,Penny,as he stood for amelia to dry him…
27602,Penny,what’s going on?
27606,Penny,"well, i’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
27609,Penny,"well, you could shove them somewhere."
27613,Penny,"you know, some people try visualization."
27614,Penny,"okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
27624,Penny,it’s not interesting. it’s incredibly insulting.
27625,Penny,"oh, my, that’s it. get out."
27635,Penny,really? you couldn’t get it out?
27636,Penny,"eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings."
27643,Penny,"raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with emily?"
27654,Penny,"robert downey, jr."
27658,Penny,"yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? what’s yours?"
27661,Penny,"come on, i’m just having some fun with you."
27662,Penny,"fine. honestly, if i could have one quality, i wish i could be as smart as you guys."
27663,Penny,sheldon.
27680,Penny,do you want to stop? i know you have trouble with eye contact.
27684,Penny,just thinking about the day i met you and leonard.
27689,Penny,like what?
27693,Penny,you can’t be this proud.
27697,Penny,this is why i’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
27699,Penny,mm-hmm.
27700,Penny,"aw, is this your first time?"
27707,Penny,"no. no, come on, i want to do it."
27713,Penny,"yeah, is it a comedy? is it a drama? nobody knows. now, come on. we are gonna do this."
27716,Penny,"sweetie, i beat you at this, too."
27720,Penny,"i mean, who even reads scientific american?"
27729,Penny,you know what? i did it. what’s four bucks?
27732,Penny,"i know, i know."
27734,Penny,"all right, hey, you two, we’re here for howard right now, okay?"
27743,Penny,shut up.
27749,Penny,so when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?
27754,Penny,wow.
27764,Penny,what? a few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
27765,Penny,"i think i started to suspect it was a bad movie when i looked at the script and saw the title, serial ape-ist 2: monkey see, monkey kill."
27766,Penny,"okay, well, i’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you."
27772,Penny,"oh, my, i would love that."
27779,Penny,decent? i make twice what you make.
27780,Penny,yeah.
27785,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you should really get some money."
27788,Penny, sheldon.
27791,Penny,"no, no. it’s about my acting career."
27792,Penny,well.
27799,Penny,oh. you’re right. i’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. huh. you are a wise man.
27802,Penny,"‘cause i already know what he’ll say. wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it."
27803,Penny,"oh, hey."
27811,Penny,"i do, and you know, i don’t think i’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it."
27816,Penny,"i, uh, huh."
27824,Penny,"so, that’s it? we’re not going?"
27825,Penny,"well, that sucks."
27827,Penny,are you sure? i could pretend i’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.
27832,Penny,because you are giving your commencement speech.
27834,Penny,"yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short."
27843,Penny,"i’ll, i’ll tell you later."
27846,Penny,don’t you want to know for sure?
27849,Penny,really? it didn’t work for you.
27853,Penny,"ah, yeah, now that’s what i’m talking about."
27854,Penny,"oh, yeah, let me show you the ring."
27861,Penny,"of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
27863,Penny,"well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
27868,Penny,"oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
27874,Penny,yeah. i’m tapping out. leonard?
27876,Penny,"okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat."
27880,Penny,"hey, i don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship."
27883,Penny,"no. sheldon, we’re getting married."
27890,Penny,you know why.
27896,Penny,i doubt it.
27903,Penny,here we go again. why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? we’re committed to each other. we’re happy. a ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
27905,Penny,"um, i’m free tonight."
27913,Penny,and no regrets.
27916,Penny,yeah.
27918,Penny,what did you do?
27919,Penny,and then what?
27923,Penny,why are you telling me this now?
27924,Penny,"really? because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it."
27926,Penny,"uh, keep your mouth off other women."
27929,Penny,just kissing.
27932,Penny,yes.
27940,Penny,"uh, actually i’m in vegas. leonard and i are about to get married."
27944,Penny,"she’s upset. look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. look at you in your little suit."
27947,Penny,"me, too."
27948,Penny,yes.
27950,Penny,what if they call our names?
27954,Penny,i know.
27955,Penny,"i love you, too."
27956,Penny,"no, thank you."
27957,Penny,no. you wrote vows?
27961,Penny,"right. um, okay. leonard, i mean, you’re not only the love of my life. i mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. you got troubles. i got ’em, too. there isn’t anything i wouldn’t do for you. we stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me."
27962,Penny,he loves that movie.
27963,Penny,we did it.
27965,Penny,"okay, let’s do it. you gonna make it?"
27967,Penny,"well, the night is still young."
27972,Penny,did you feel guilty after kissing her?
27973,Penny,"what do you mean, every time you see her?"
27974,Penny,you still see her?
27986,Penny,i’m with leonard.
27988,Penny,i told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
27990,Penny,sheldon.
27992,Penny,you couldn’t sleep either?
27996,Penny,can we talk?
27998,Penny,"okay, when i’m done with him, i’m gonna need more information."
28001,Penny,"no, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe i should."
28002,Penny,"no, i just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on."
28004,Penny,i guess my big problem is i never saw leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
28008,Penny,"you know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. he’s cockier now."
28014,Penny,"yeah. yeah, sometimes i worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you."
28018,Penny,"it’s getting kind of cheesy, leonard."
28031,Penny,"we are. i mean, he sleeps here. but it’s only a matter of time before sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the leonard-shaped pile of pillows."
28034,Penny,"you know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
28040,Penny,"no. all you need is a needle and an ice cube. i’ve done it, like, a dozen times."
28042,Penny,"uh, no, not yet. there’s still a few people i haven’t told personally."
28043,Penny,"oh, just my parents and my entire family."
28048,Penny,i’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
28057,Penny,"last week. i’m sorry, i should’ve told you. it was a spur of the moment thing. i feel terrible. please don’t be too disappointed."
28059,Penny,"aw, thank you, daddy. that means so much."
28062,Penny,no.
28063,Penny,moondance?
28068,Penny,"before i made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother."
28069,Penny,no. he was a beloved member of the family.
28070,Penny,it’s not funny. you’re up. call your mother.
28072,Penny,try dialing.
28073,Penny,"okay, just give me that. amy broke up with sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. hang on. she wants to talk to you."
28087,Penny,"hey, we’re going to dinner. you want to come?"
28093,Penny,"trust me, this is the right thing."
28098,Penny,sure.
28109,Penny,"well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
28116,Penny,"oh, good for him."
28117,Penny,"so is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?"
28131,Penny,chug.
28134,Penny,i can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
28150,Penny,i know. it just…
28152,Penny,oh pfft.
28157,Penny,"sweetie, you’re yelling."
28162,Penny,are you telling the truth?
28165,Penny,aren’t you worried you’re making french toast on oatmeal day?
28178,Penny,we don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
28181,Penny,"what, and you think i want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?"
28182,Penny,"no, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see."
28193,Penny,i had to; we’re married now.
28194,Penny,"what? here, give me, give me. oh, my god. oh, my god, they’re coming right towards us."
28196,Penny,"oh, no."
28198,Penny,but we can’t.
28209,Penny,"well, you don’t know everything about me."
28219,Penny,how can reading my journal be an accident?
28231,Penny,yeah. so you have a song stuck in your head. it happens to everybody.
28234,Penny,"hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?"
28237,Penny,"oh, my god, he won’t stop."
28238,Penny,nobody knows. that’s why he’s number one. can you please go talk to him?
28239,Penny,once? who got the gum out of his hair?
28240,Penny,fine.
28248,Penny,"she did soften your life, didn’t she?"
28249,Penny,better. you’re the lint trap of my love.
28251,Penny,"uh, sweetie, you do realize thursday is amy’s birthday."
28252,Penny,you guys just got back together. you might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
28254,Penny,"well, find out."
28264,Penny,"sure, sure. or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
28267,Penny,yes. he said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
28270,Penny,"knowing them, they will."
28284,Penny,"yeah, no one cares. did you help me out or not?"
28292,Penny,i don’t wanna.
28300,Penny,i guess i just miss when life was simpler.
28305,Penny,"oh, i love me some leo."
28307,Penny,"sheldon, i cooked you breakfast. i made your bed. i checked your mouth for thrush. you can rub your own chest."
28319,Penny,you couldn’t give us just one weekend?
28328,Penny,yes. i’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
28344,Penny,so what did you say?
28351,Penny,hi there. what’s your name?
28352,Penny,"oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, glen?"
28364,Penny,you’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
28366,Penny,"okay, like what?"
28369,Penny,midnight.
28377,Penny,"oh, that’s all right. all i heard was skinny."
28378,Penny,"yeah, i’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
28379,Penny,"yeah, yeah, we should go out."
28381,Penny,"we can, but all right."
28393,Penny,"so, you gonna get up there later?"
28398,Penny,"on the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
28407,Penny,no music it is.
28408,Penny,"thank you so much for helping us, stuart."
28410,Penny,"yeah, birthday party first. pity party later."
28413,Penny,"because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though i’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. so, what’s going on?"
28420,Penny,"oh, wait, wait, wait. stuart didn’t get to speak."
28421,Penny,you nailed it.
28428,Penny,i know one way to find out. sniff this.
28430,Penny,"well, never hurts to have a spare."
28441,Penny,"you know what, hang on. what if sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?"
28442,Penny,no. what i’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of howard.
28446,Penny,"yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em."
28448,Penny,is there anything we can do to help?
28452,Penny,oh.
28455,Penny,"yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."
28468,Penny,"okay, here they come."
28476,Penny,"okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?"
28485,Penny,"well, we’ll be in the woods."
28487,Penny,it’s so cute and rustic up here.
28489,Penny,"well, she is taking me to an indigo girls concert, so hold that thought."
28494,Penny,got it.
28495,Penny,"hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?"
28499,Penny,"very funny. okay, never have i ever… yeah, you know what? let’s just circle back."
28501,Penny,"what, he arrested you for that?"
28507,Penny,we’re married. we’re supposed to share everything.
28512,Penny,"well, i have a secret i’ve been keeping from you, too."
28513,Penny,i hate my job.
28515,Penny,because i know how important it is to you that i’m having some success.
28519,Penny,i guess.
28520,Penny,"i love you, too."
28531,Penny,really? the only adult?
28533,Penny,"oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting."
28537,Penny,"leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here."
28541,Penny,where’d you get that from?
28542,Penny,"ugh. amy, why did you tell him that?"
28544,Penny,what about your weird relationship with him?
28553,Penny,"hey, you ready to go?"
28555,Penny,you actually smell the wine?
28559,Penny,"no honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it."
28569,Penny,"oh, leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."
28581,Penny,you really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
28582,Penny,or a way for you to avoid her?
28586,Penny,or as i know him?
28590,Penny,"um, does pottery barn, spring count?"
28593,Penny,"oh. sorry. didn’t know you made those. hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"
28597,Penny,"um, it has seat warmers."
28598,Penny,how long have i had spinach in my teeth?
28599,Penny,"okay, you know what? this is ridiculous. i’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly i’m getting nowhere."
28602,Penny,"okay, good example."
28616,Penny,"leonard, come on, she’s your mom. if we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?"
28618,Penny,"thanks to overcrowding, yeah."
28629,Penny,sorry.
28631,Penny,thank you.
28632,Penny,"uh, who’s hungry? we have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
28634,Penny,"you know, beverly, i know you and alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no leonard. so that’s good, right?"
28641,Penny,"so, what did we miss?"
28644,Penny,aw.
28650,Penny,"okay, i’m gonna go pick up my family. like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic."
28652,Penny,"what? oh. hi. okay, hey there, i got, i’m sorry, i got to go now."
28654,Penny,"okay, beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? all we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. "
28659,Penny,"well, mom, i’m sorry, but…"
28660,Penny,"so, uh, randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in california."
28670,Penny,oh.
28680,Penny,"yeah, drive safe. we love you. and give us a call… oh, my god, it was me, it was me. i’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
28697,Penny,does he even like lemon bars?
28704,Penny,"well, it just slipped out. i feel terrible."
28707,Penny,"oh, thank you, and i’m sorry i lied about it. "
28708,Penny,"oh, that’s what amy said. so what’s going on with the research project? are they gonna let you run it?"
28710,Penny,that’s funny. i learned something totally different.
28711,Penny,"oh, that’s so beautiful."
28746,Penny,"you know, i’m very proud of you for trying to live with amy."
28749,Penny,"mm. well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
28763,Penny,i told you not to do the worm.
28764,Penny,"yeah, get it, girl."
28775,Penny,didn’t.
28780,Penny,"sheldon, what do you say to that?"
28785,Penny,as you?
28788,Penny,"well, so does leonard. it’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world."
28792,Penny,is it? oh. it’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
28795,Penny,you kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘cause it’s fine.
28800,Penny,all right. come on. what is really going on with you?
28801,Penny,all right.
28803,Penny,"oh, now i’m with ya. okay."
28810,Penny,okay.
28814,Penny,do you want him back?
28824,Penny,what’s all this?
28829,Penny,"alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
28831,Penny,i don’t know. be cool. he’s coming. he’s coming. hi. 
28846,Penny,"oh, sure."
28847,Penny,leonard…
28884,Penny,that candle and you.
28887,Penny,okay. open your eyes and see your new room.
28900,Penny,"ooh, sheldon gonna get some."
28913,Penny,what?
28915,Penny,"seriously, none of you liked it?"
28917,Penny,i think i hate all of you nerds.
28923,Penny,but it’s a picture of you.
28924,Penny,but you commissioned it.
28926,Penny,i seem to be losing.
28929,Penny,so if it breaks there’d be none of it?
28930,Penny,thank you.
28933,Penny,are you sure?
28937,Penny,"what, what are you doing in our apartment?"
28941,Penny,"we’re good, thank you."
28944,Penny,"yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
28948,Penny,"well, it doesn’t matter. we’re not going to the hospital now."
28950,Penny,"oh, my god. it’s your birthday. let’s do something fun."
28959,Penny,howard and bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. how cool is that?
28966,Penny,oh! 
28970,Penny,"mm, that one kind of looks like bernadette."
28987,Penny,okay. then what happened?
28990,Penny,"to be fair, we may have been on edge because of the christmas tree."
28991,Penny,you do make a cute elf.
29000,Penny,there’s no shame in asking for a break.
29005,Penny,so things started to turn around?
29016,Penny,i hadn’t really thought about it.
29019,Penny,"well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more. "
29028,Penny,"it’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
29030,Penny,"okay, you know what? maybe i’ll take amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
29052,Penny,my dad asked if i can get him a job interview at my work.
29063,Penny,like you talked to me about your gaming room?
29070,Penny,"look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
29071,Penny,"yes, we’re fine."
29073,Penny,"he won’t be mad at me. i mean, you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come, so…"
29088,Penny,i’m just not really in the mood anymore.
29094,Penny,"i get that, okay? it’s just, leonard and i have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
29105,Penny,that must’ve been expensive.
29112,Penny,you don’t how much your rent is?
29115,Penny,"raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
29116,Penny,"okay, only if you’re sure. whew."
29118,Penny,"oh, let me guess. you guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
29119,Penny,"well, he has a job. how bad can it be?"
29122,Penny,"well, leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so i thought maybe this year i’d tag along."
29123,Penny,"so, do you want to come?"
29129,Penny,"well, you and i would get our own room, right?"
29133,Penny,"i can’t, it’ll break his heart. you know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside."
29137,Penny,"this is just something you usually do together, and if i’m screwing it up, i don’t have to go."
29140,Penny,hey.
29146,Penny,"it’s not complicated. amy’s driving, that’s it."
29149,Penny,i just thought it would make you happy.
29150,Penny,"hold on, i’m trying to decide if i’m mad at you. no, i’m happy i don’t have to go."
29158,Penny,you’re an even better husband.
29172,Penny,"yeah, this is a special circumstance."
29179,Penny,"well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
29186,Penny,"yeah, i guess they don’t have sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
29189,Penny,"yeah, bye, sweetie."
29194,Penny,"i bet jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because i work twice as hard as she does."
29198,Penny,"well, this is a moisturizing mask."
29203,Penny,"mm. well, we’ve loved having you around. right, sweetie? leonard?"
29211,Penny,"oh, are you sure? we’re celebrating our new add drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
29221,Penny,it’s nine o’clock. 
29226,Penny,"well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. i mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
29229,Penny,"oh, wait. i remember."
29260,Penny,"oh, that’s a nice offer."
29270,Penny,"what, you wouldn’t trust him?"
29271,Penny,"yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
29280,Penny,"you don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
29285,Penny,"champagne, champagne."
29290,Penny,"okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? okay, that’s cool."
29301,Penny,"oh, come on. look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to new jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one."
29309,Penny,"okay, i’m good now."
29312,Penny,i cannot believe leonard mentioned the toblerone but left that part out.
29320,Penny,come on. looks don’t matter to sheldon. because he only has eyes for you.
29326,Penny,"okay, correct me if i’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
29327,Penny,"you got fingers and a mouth, you call her."
29328,Penny,"all right, this is making me crazy. somebody’s got to go over there."
29333,Penny,we need to talk.
29338,Penny,right.
29346,Penny,leonard!
29349,Penny,"ah, hey leonard."
29354,Penny,"oh hey, when did you get here, hi!"
29357,Penny,"okay, i have a problem."
29358,Penny,"oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
29359,Penny,"hi guys, my friends and i got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. "
29372,Penny,"oh, hey guys."
29374,Penny,"oh, hey guys."
29383,Penny,"i’m fine, leonard, just go away."
29398,Penny,get out.
29416,Penny,hey.
29417,Penny,hello?
29421,Penny,freaky.
29424,Penny,why doesn’t he just get another job?
29425,Penny,"oh, god, how did he know?"
29428,Penny,"hey, sheldon, can i talk to you for a second?"
29431,Penny,oh.
29434,Penny,"oh, it’s about time, i’m starving."
29443,Penny,"here you go, one rosewater ricky."
29449,Penny,"mrs. cooper, hey, it’s penny. yeah, i think i broke your son. hey, hold on. talk to your mother."
29459,Penny,"yeah, sure!"
29461,Penny,what do you think?
29462,Penny,give me a minute.
29469,Penny,you should probably drive.
29473,Penny,what the hell?!
29474,Penny,nothing to see here. just sexy police business.
29478,Penny,"hey, guys. i don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but i thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. so, bernadette? bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from forever 21. and there’s amy, showing all kinds of ankle. in an outfit i’m assuming is from forever 63. and i, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty."
29481,Penny,how could red hulk be worthy?
29482,Penny,"you doing okay, sweetie?"
29486,Penny,leonard! hi!
29488,Penny,hurry.

23072,Penny,"i used sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then i had like fourteen dollars left over."
23073,Penny,"put it back in your pocket, or i’ll find some other place to put it."
23075,Penny,"yeah, i know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way."
23079,Penny,that is not the definition of professional.
23087,Penny,"i don’t know, but i may have to find a cheaper place to live."
23088,Penny,why not?
23091,Penny,and you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
23097,Penny,"well, i cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."

23106,Penny,"uh, i’m penny. i’m his neighbour."
23108,Penny,"uh, why don’t you come with me. i’ll walk you to the apartment."

23323,Penny,"what can i say? i got my geek on, boys."
23326,Penny,"i cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. i mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. you know that just last week, she had howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in orange county to pick up her tv?"
23330,Penny,"uh, no. no, no, no, you know, congratulations, i think you’ll make a great hooker."

23522,Penny,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i’m not feeling so hot either."
23529,Penny,not a lot. just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
23530,Penny,"i don’t know. i mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."

23538,Penny,"tell you what, next french toast day, i will make you oatmeal."
23543,Penny,"you know what, i give up. he’s impossible."
23546,Penny,"ooh, sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think i’ll punch you."
23553,Penny,thank you.
23554,Penny,what’s this cartoon called again?
23555,Penny,"anime. you know, i knew a girl in high school named anna may. anna may fletcher. she was born with one nostril. then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three."
23558,Penny,thank you.
23567,Penny,"oh, you know, that reminds me, i usually go back to nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial."
23570,Penny,tur-briska-fil?
23571,Penny,"raj, what about you?"
23578,Penny,"yes, we know."
23585,Penny,are we terrible people?
23589,Penny,"okay, i’ve got another question. when does this get fun?"
23590,Penny,which one?
23591,Penny,how could he ruin the game?
23592,Penny,"sheldon, that is incredible."
23594,Penny,"because the last me i didn’t go, i ended up playing mystic warlords of ka."
23602,Penny,and you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
23613,Penny,am i a matchmaker or what?
23616,Penny,"oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, i’ve got some friends coming over. not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the nebraska game."
23618,Penny,"well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone."
23619,Penny,see ya.
23623,Penny,"oh, my god, no. why would you ask that?"
23624,Penny,sure you have.
23630,Penny,they have them every week.
23638,Penny,"sheldon, come in."
23645,Penny,"so, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. he is really smart."
23646,Penny,"wow, sheldon, i cannot believe you made up your own game."
23666,Penny,are you ready to apologize?
23669,Penny,"oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
23670,Penny,"oh, thank you very much. come back soon. with the other half of my tip. hey, sheldon, what are you doing here?"
23677,Penny,"no, no, sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
23692,Penny,"i hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
23695,Penny,"oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
23701,Penny,yeah?
23707,Penny,"oh, my god, would you let this go?!"
23709,Penny,"you know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?"
23719,Penny,what?
23727,Penny,ow.
23730,Penny,"i don’t need panties, i just need shorts and a shirt."
23733,Penny,seriously? those shorts with that top?
23735,Penny,"okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
23736,Penny,but don’t look.
23737,Penny,i don’t want you to see me naked.
23740,Penny,is that my arm?
23744,Penny,"all right, can we please go?"
23746,Penny,"in a parking lot in hollywood. now, can we please go?"
23749,Penny,no. the light has been on since i bought the car.
23751,Penny,"oh, god, i’m gonna lose the arm."
23752,Penny,what?
23753,Penny,"it’s not soup, it’s courage."
23754,Penny,how did you see it? you said you wouldn’t look.
23762,Penny,"oh, next question."
23768,Penny,"you know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie wall-e at the end. you’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
23773,Penny,what exactly does that mean?
23783,Penny,"all right, you know what, i will tell you why it’s wrong…"
23784,Penny,what?
23785,Penny,"oh, gee, you’re too late. scarlett johansson and wonder woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
23788,Penny,wow.
23793,Penny,"oh, i am so sorry."
23812,Penny,you’re sitting here playing video games all day.
23818,Penny,ready to get started?
23820,Penny,i have to take notes?
23822,Penny,thank you.
23824,Penny,"um, does this have anything to do with leonard’s work?"
23826,Penny,i have to go to the bathroom.
23829,Penny,sorry.
23831,Penny,hey! you don’t have to be so mean!
23833,Penny,"oh, god, sheldon, look i’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. can you just back up a little bit?"
23837,Penny,squared?
23838,Penny,aristotle?
23840,Penny,then i don’t know.
23846,Penny,"oh, balls."
23848,Penny,"oh, i always tear up when the grinch’s heart grows three sizes."
23852,Penny,"oh, sounds festive. did you at least give presents?"
23861,Penny,why wouldn’t she approve of me? i’m adorable.
23862,Penny,"hey, it’s a big menu. there’s two pages just for desserts."
23865,Penny,"you didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?"
23866,Penny,why not?
23868,Penny,"no, it sounded like a compliment."
23879,Penny,"okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
23892,Penny,"yeah, not bad, not bad."
23893,Penny,"oh, thank you."
23898,Penny,"oh, thank you, beverly."
23902,Penny,"okay. well, i went to this psychic who told me that if i cut my hair, i’m going to get a national commercial."
23906,Penny,"oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
23909,Penny,amazing. would you like to try some?
23910,Penny,"well, the fact is, you can’t."
23911,Penny,maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
23925,Penny,who is it?
23933,Penny,"oh, my…"
23938,Penny,"come on, sheldon, you can’t move. don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
23942,Penny,"sheldon, that’s so… "
23943,Penny,whatcha doing?
23951,Penny,shh.
23952,Penny,"oh, poor baby."
23965,Penny,leonard doesn’t snore.
23966,Penny,"okay, i’ll get those drinks started for you."
23969,Penny,"you just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
23971,Penny,"sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what i do. i’m a waitress, not a busboy."
23972,Penny,"hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. what’s this?"
23976,Penny,"oh. wow. okay. let’s see. we’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, swiss cheese, fondue. my lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then i’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
23988,Penny,hello.
23992,Penny,i’m sorry. is this supposed to be buttering me up?
23995,Penny,i’ll talk to leonard.
23996,Penny,"yes. if it means that much to you, you should go."
23997,Penny,you’re welcome.
23998,Penny,i think we’re there.
24006,Penny,yep. ‘cause i’m gonna be dead.
24012,Penny,"i don’t know what to tell you, sheldon."
24014,Penny,hi!
24027,Penny,"okay, look, they sent me the ticket. i told them i wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?"
24030,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sorry. i’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. you know, as soon as i get a part in a movie or my own tv series."
24041,Penny,we’re home.
24042,Penny,"i’m going to write you a cheque for that. as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
24043,Penny,"okay, i realize that…"
24045,Penny,did he just somehow give me the finger?
24048,Penny,ah. cool. got any fun plans?
24054,Penny,then why did you tell me you had it?
24057,Penny,what kind of deal?
24068,Penny,nice to meet you.
24074,Penny,that is so sad.
24077,Penny,"hey, guys. enjoying your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
24087,Penny,why not?
24093,Penny,"okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself."
24095,Penny,"oh. i say a lot of things, sweetie. so, how about it, sheldon?"
24109,Penny,"here, see if this one works."
24110,Penny,sure.
24111,Penny,having a little trouble catching your breath there?
24112,Penny,do or do not. there is no try.
24118,Penny,hmm.
24128,Penny,"yeah, why?"
24132,Penny,"okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
24137,Penny,"um, ach."
24148,Penny,"really? so, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause i said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
24149,Penny,"look, leonard, you have to know how much i care about you. it’s just that i’ve said the l word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well."
24159,Penny,mm-hmm.
24160,Penny,"yeah, that’s right."
24164,Penny,really?
24168,Penny,i know.
24174,Penny,what?
24177,Penny,"okay, here’s the protocol, you and i are still friends, and you stop saying coitus."
24178,Penny,really?
24188,Penny,"oh. um, okay. why don’t you give me an hour and come over?"
24194,Penny,"no. why, do you?"
24196,Penny,"all right. so, what’s new in your life?"
24197,Penny,have you been running?
24199,Penny,"well, maybe that’s ’cause leonard can’t cook."
24200,Penny,"whatever. ooh, i’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge."
24212,Penny,"okay, whatever."
24213,Penny,"all right, got it. is there anything else?"
24218,Penny,"no, you already threw up once. go put on your pjs and brush your teeth."
24220,Penny,"you’re welcome, sweetie."
24228,Penny,"good night, leonard."
24230,Penny,"what? what are you doing with, what?"
24241,Penny,"nice to meet you, too. are you enjoying your stay?"
24244,Penny,we just broke up.
24245,Penny,not as good as you apparently.
24246,Penny,"you know what? it’s, it’s none of my business. if you want to sleep with sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
24249,Penny,"oh, no, no, it’s okay. you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
24252,Penny,you mean you and dr. slutbunny?
24254,Penny,"no, you don’t."
24259,Penny,"uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
24261,Penny,"well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
24272,Penny,"so, what, that’s it? you’ve stayed with sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
24273,Penny,"oh, yeah, i’m wondering about that. you said it was working when you moved in."
24275,Penny,"okay, how do you know he said that? you left the room."
24276,Penny,fine. go ahead. 
24281,Penny,"excuse me, i was in high school. studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. "
24282,Penny,"oh, hi. what’s going on?"
24292,Penny,"okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun."
24296,Penny,"‘cause in the olden days, i never would’ve known he was so stupid."
24297,Penny,"yes, he was! he thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
24303,Penny,"oh, thanks, i’m not hungry."
24308,Penny,"oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
24309,Penny,"leonard, last night was a mistake."
24317,Penny,"oh, does that come up much on the space station?"
24319,Penny,"oh, it’s not bad. kind of hungry."
24323,Penny,you stole it?
24331,Penny,"okay, i have a question."
24333,Penny,"oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? you know, when your private parts started growing?"
24358,Penny,"my point is, i know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
24360,Penny,"so, um, amy, sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other."
24361,Penny,"yeah, it’s okay."
24366,Penny,"okay. uncomfortable silence it is. hey, sheldon, have you told amy what it was like for you growing up in texas?"
24373,Penny,"so, um, amy, what about you? do you date much?"
24380,Penny,"okay, sheldon, i think you’ve made your point."
24383,Penny,i did not have sex with 31 guys.
24392,Penny,"yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. i’m a little low on cash."
24395,Penny,okay.
24397,Penny,for what?
24403,Penny,"no, it won’t. um, how does he know i jog?"
24404,Penny,"oh, my god, that is so creepy!"
24410,Penny,"no. i just run till i’m hungry, then i stop for a bear claw."
24414,Penny,"okay, let’s just warm up on the run."
24415,Penny,"okay, let’s go."
24423,Penny,"yeah, to be honest, i don’t see much difference."
24429,Penny,"yeah, i know who he is. i watch dancing with the stars."
24430,Penny,"you know, there’s an olive garden down the street. you guys should try it sometime."
24436,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
24440,Penny,"okay, i’m just gonna walk away, ’cause i don’t want to be here."
24442,Penny,get one yourself.
24443,Penny,"god, he’s an ass when he drinks."
24449,Penny,no.
24454,Penny,"wow. that’s like the worst country song ever. so, how are you doing?"
24456,Penny,"well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough."
24462,Penny,"oh, howard, heads up. your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift."
24464,Penny,"oh, absolutely."
24471,Penny,"oh, god. i think i see where this is going."
24481,Penny,are you gonna want to order food?
24482,Penny,okay.
24483,Penny,that’s what i told him when he asked me. i hope that’s not out of line.
24486,Penny,"it’s passion fruit, new on the menu."
24496,Penny,could you be a little more specific?
24498,Penny,"great.  now, where were we?"
24500,Penny,"oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. why don’t you give it a try."
24511,Penny,"okay, help me out here. how does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?"
24512,Penny,"and i can’t believe you’ve never read eat, pray, love."
24516,Penny,"yeah, i think i’ll pass. but you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds."
24522,Penny,"you know amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts."
24524,Penny,so where should we go tonight? a bar? a club? a movie?
24526,Penny,that’s okay. y ou can just sleep here.
24528,Penny,not even when you were a kid?
24530,Penny,howard has a hairy chest?
24531,Penny,"okay, there you go, sultry sunrise red. what do you think?"
24535,Penny,what the hell was that?
24540,Penny,you can only ask one question.
24545,Penny,so you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
24548,Penny,"just guys. anyway, when i told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s leonard? why can’t you get back together with leonard? i bet leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. so to get him off my back, i told him we worked things out."
24549,Penny,what?
24564,Penny,good night.
24568,Penny,why are you making this so difficult?
24575,Penny,"no, you’re right. no, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. so what other annoying habits shall we discuss?"
40970,Sheldon,"uh, just a couple more items. howard, i found this letter from your dad in a box. now, based on the content, it could either be filed…"
40973,Sheldon,thanks. oh. great party.
40974,Sheldon,bleuch. like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
40976,Sheldon,"oh, dear. my mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city."
40977,Sheldon,"oh. oh, i’ve got that in spades. ravage me."
40995,Sheldon,it was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate one-eyed willy.
41006,Sheldon,"if we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, i’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle."
41007,Sheldon,"excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. a guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. if we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."
41009,Sheldon,"raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of leonard like that."
41012,Sheldon,mm-hmm.
41017,Sheldon,"but i suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. let’s see. oh, janine davis. oh, dear."
41018,Sheldon,well…
41025,Sheldon,"because you want to start watching it right now. copy that. let’s see. up next on the tenure committee is professor wu. well, get ready for the complete works of jackie chan."
41029,Sheldon,"eh, it will be. honestly, if i must endure a long and tedious evening, i’d rather it be with you on date night. but i have no choice. the tenure committee’s going to be there."
41031,Sheldon,"actually, i meant you could drive me. but if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too."
41033,Sheldon,sad.
41039,Sheldon,what are you going to do? take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
41042,Sheldon,are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
41045,Sheldon,um…
41047,Sheldon,"i don’t know what you’re doing, but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with raj’s mother for a dollar."
41048,Sheldon,what do you think i should do?
41053,Sheldon,"i don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, i do want to express my gratitude."
41054,Sheldon,"no, no. no, i learned my lesson. i understand that was inappropriate."
41062,Sheldon,"well, they can’t cancel it. it ended on a cliffhanger."
41066,Sheldon,no. they can’t just cancel a show like alphas. you know? they have to help the viewers let go. firefly did a movie to wrap things up. buffy the vampire slayer continued on as a comic book. heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
41069,Sheldon,"yeah, but i just told you, i don’t have a problem with closure."
41075,Sheldon,the same way any normal person would. i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldon-face confetti.
41076,Sheldon,"or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
41077,Sheldon,you don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. to have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
41080,Sheldon,"lucky for you, ’cause i wished you were dead."
41090,Sheldon,professor proton hosted my favourite science show when i was a child. i never missed an episode. he demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
41092,Sheldon,"well, whatever we want. hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
41099,Sheldon,i’m getting worried.
41100,Sheldon,"professor proton was never late when he was on tv. you know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. unless tornadoes were ripping apart east texas, in which case we’d join him in progress.  it’s him. hello. well, i see. yes. all right, we can come get you. yeah, well, see you soon. bye."
41107,Sheldon,"yes. and if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
41124,Sheldon,want me to sing it again?
41126,Sheldon,name it.
41127,Sheldon,"oh, you’re not. you look awful."
41128,Sheldon,are you saying that you want me to be professor proton?
41132,Sheldon,father.
41138,Sheldon,"as good? you just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes."
41141,Sheldon,"okay, well, i have a sound effect for those sound effects. "
41143,Sheldon,"it would? fun? okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play d&d? do you have a drug problem?"
41145,Sheldon,i’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
41147,Sheldon,"okay, literal goose bumps. look."
41151,Sheldon,yay!
41158,Sheldon,you see what happens when you let girls play d&d?
41162,Sheldon,"oh, my. that’s an uncomfortable topic. amy, before i met you, i never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
41165,Sheldon,"i know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
41167,Sheldon,"well, no. hold on. my elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. we wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through."
41175,Sheldon,"well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? uh, you know star trek. should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
41180,Sheldon,"i’m not afraid to be alone. on land. on the sea, it would be terrifying. because of all the drowning."
41188,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. you know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches."
41189,Sheldon,"it’s not that big of an opportunity. and even if hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. i mean, me? i’m interested in the big questions."
41205,Sheldon,"don’t worry, officer. they just love each other. we’re not smuggling drugs."
41208,Sheldon,"you’re dodging the question, i knew it was you. what was that?"
41216,Sheldon,you’re welcome. good night.
41217,Sheldon,"dear lord, you’re an astronomer. although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the milky way."
41220,Sheldon,"penny, did you ever wonder how starfleet captains…"
41221,Sheldon,"well, now that i’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3d chess."
41222,Sheldon,you overestimate his significance in my life.
41225,Sheldon,great. i’ll go first.
41231,Sheldon,we’re all out of alcohol.
41235,Sheldon,are you in danger?
41247,Sheldon,here is a hot beverage to comfort you. it’s in a to-go cup. make of that what you will.
41249,Sheldon,all right. in 4d chess…
41251,Sheldon,i see. i own nine pairs of underpants.
41253,Sheldon,i’ve seen that. yeah. serial apeist. howard found it online the day we met you.
41264,Sheldon,"changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
41265,Sheldon,"joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. with leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
41271,Sheldon,i’m a real collector. how rare is it?
41274,Sheldon,"oh, right, a present for leonard. you better throw in that squirt gun."
41279,Sheldon,"what, now, do you have company?"
41281,Sheldon,"i’m quite familiar with plumbing. not to brag, but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
41286,Sheldon,what’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
41288,Sheldon,have you gotten leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
41289,Sheldon,"oh, great. do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
41292,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i’m just distracted by something that happened over at penny’s.
41293,Sheldon,i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard.
41295,Sheldon,"oh, really? she and i once had a staring contest. she clapped really loud and made me blink. it’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
41297,Sheldon,i hear a woman’s voice.
41299,Sheldon,"there’s kissing in star trek, smarty-pants."
41300,Sheldon,"please. why would leonard come home early and waste his time kissing penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? yeah, that’s it. i’m catching her in the act. "
41301,Sheldon,aha. 
41302,Sheldon,leonard?
41304,Sheldon,"oh, no, i should apologize. uh, i never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
41307,Sheldon,amy?
41308,Sheldon,"fine. leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
41309,Sheldon,"no, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with penny."
41315,Sheldon,"okay. by the way, you have something on your shirt."
41317,Sheldon,"you say you’re from new jersey, but how can i believe you?"
41321,Sheldon,"you say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
41323,Sheldon,hello. so i guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
41327,Sheldon,i let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. you have any idea the kind of coupons i’m going to get in the mail now?
41329,Sheldon,yes. you’re either with me or against me.
41330,Sheldon,maybe there’s a third option.
41338,Sheldon,think of me when you apply it.
41348,Sheldon,"no, oh, it actually is if you get the joke. it’s based on the premise that princeton isn’t a very good school. "
41351,Sheldon,"yes, and do you know what the odds are i’d pick your name?"
41353,Sheldon,what are you doing? you have to start with the edges.
41362,Sheldon,i thought we were the lightning sharks.
41366,Sheldon,"and i’m sure your parents are proud. now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to fantastic four member the thing, who’s made entirely of…"
41367,Sheldon,those are map coordinates. got ’em. let’s go.
41368,Sheldon,"no one likes a know-it-all, penny."
41375,Sheldon,"wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt."
41379,Sheldon,be there in a minute. i just have to pre-soak these.
41380,Sheldon,so what’d you think?
41398,Sheldon,"excellent. then i shall see you tomorrow. good night, dr. fowler."
41402,Sheldon,"are you sure? every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
41410,Sheldon,"you know, riding with leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. the only car game he ever wants to play is the quiet game. and he’s terrible at it, i always win."
41417,Sheldon,that’s a raging ogre.
41422,Sheldon,"well, i was. but that was before howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
41427,Sheldon,hmm. you sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
41438,Sheldon,"oh, please, i’m your boyfriend. you call me sheldon. that’s right, i am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
41440,Sheldon,dr. fowler?
41445,Sheldon,aw. embarrassed you?
41448,Sheldon,"well, now, that."
41450,Sheldon,"oh, i had to take the bus home. fell asleep and missed my stop."
41452,Sheldon,"well, i do now. they’re a lovely people. although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. if you’re hungry, i brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
41457,Sheldon,but you don’t even know…
41458,Sheldon,"but, now, but in my defence…"
41465,Sheldon,"i wasn’t speaking about me. i mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. you know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. giving you the opportunity to drive me home. breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
41467,Sheldon,"well, i should hope so. i don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. not even a good-bye? you see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. poor kid. she just doesn’t see it."
41469,Sheldon,"can’t listen, zone. also don’t care."
41470,Sheldon,really don’t care.
41472,Sheldon,"ooh, somebody call the burn ward. and back to the zone."
41475,Sheldon,"look at it. i feel like my mind just made a baby. and it’s beautiful. it’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
41477,Sheldon,"gentlemen. uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. i don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. "
41478,Sheldon,"oh, well, thank you. believe it or not, i just learned a chinese research team at the hubei institute for nuclear physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
41483,Sheldon,"and that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in physics today? i’ll give you a hint. you measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
41496,Sheldon,"you know, frankly, i’d prefer a sex tape."
41498,Sheldon,stop it. stop celebrating me.
41501,Sheldon,the national science foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
41502,Sheldon,i know. when will this nightmare end?
41503,Sheldon,you’re not?
41506,Sheldon,"i hate to pile on the bad news, but i just got a raise."
41511,Sheldon,you distract me. i’ve been distracted since the moment i met you. 
41518,Sheldon,"this is my girlfriend, amy. amy, this is television legend arthur jeffries. his science show inspired millions of children."
41525,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not cry.
41530,Sheldon,"that’s kind of a stretch. look, when it comes to social skills, i’ve mastered the big three. there’s the coy smile. there’s the friendly chuckle. there’s the vocalization of sympathy. aw. that last one’s tricky, i’m still working on it."
41533,Sheldon,"oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. go ahead, amy, say i’m annoying. i’m annoying. i’m annoying. i’m annoying. yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? look, you know you want to say it, say it. say i’m annoying. go ahead, say it. say it. say it. amy, say it. well, she can’t stand it when i’m right."
41536,Sheldon,"well, i would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of hollywood stars."
41537,Sheldon,it’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that i may have been annoying to you.
41543,Sheldon,"say it. arthur, say it. say i’m annoying. say it. say it. i’m annoying. say it. "
41552,Sheldon,thank you. it would be an honour.
41558,Sheldon,"oh, wait here. i’ll get some alka-seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at bill nye’s house. as long as i’m not within 500 feet of it."
41570,Sheldon,i said i would.
41571,Sheldon,"okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? remember, when you can hear me, i can hear you. and second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. it’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain i can’t scratch."
41579,Sheldon,i’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
41582,Sheldon,"hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
41585,Sheldon,"there’s nothing to tell. maybe i purchased a book entitled don’t sweat the small stuff and i followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
41586,Sheldon,"please. ha-ha, oh."
41595,Sheldon,i know. and it wasn’t easy. do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
41598,Sheldon,"oh, since you put it that way, i’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
41600,Sheldon,"ugh, fine, i’ll go. but if her food is delicious, thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you."
41606,Sheldon,yes. like we’re on a ship. coming from africa to america.
41611,Sheldon,"i don’t know the first thing about women, but i would not follow her."
41612,Sheldon,they passed against a nickel defence. they should have run it off-tackle.
41615,Sheldon,i don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. there’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
41617,Sheldon,so was my dad. and then he did.
41623,Sheldon,"all i know is you can only fit one of her in a car. and there’s the clown that came out of her. i really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best thanksgivings i’ve had in a long time."
41630,Sheldon,"thank you. uh, the university made me come here. i didn’t want to. uh, big fan of the show."
41631,Sheldon,yes.
41632,Sheldon,who? give me their names. i bet it’s wolowitz.
41633,Sheldon,can we talk about something else? do you know that i yodel?
41634,Sheldon,"yes, yes, i’d be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry. everyone laugh at the circus freak. you know, i don’t need to sit here and take this, flatow. it is because of bullies like you, every day more and more americans are making the switch to television."
41640,Sheldon,do you have cookies?
41641,Sheldon,good. i don’t deserve cookies. come in. wil?
41643,Sheldon,"certainly. although, right now, i’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque."
41648,Sheldon,would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
41656,Sheldon,i can’t believe it.
41665,Sheldon,"oh, yes, nine. welcome back, buddy."
41668,Sheldon,can you believe this guy?
41671,Sheldon,"no, no, no, that’s okay. i can fight my own battles. isn’t that right, bawwy."
41677,Sheldon,"thank you. ira, if i may, i’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
41679,Sheldon,i believe i can answer that.
41681,Sheldon,"you’re telling it wrong. ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. a small town in east texas, where a young genius named…"
41694,Sheldon,the second i go out of town you throw a christmas party without me? 
41696,Sheldon,<i>she went into labor an hour ago.
41697,Sheldon,"no, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the stone age and a cave wasn’t available."
41702,Sheldon,did you hear that? a mop. i have two phds yet somehow i’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
41703,Sheldon,hello.
41713,Sheldon,"oh, thank you. i wasn’t sure i was gonna to make it. but my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and i just thought to myself, sheldon, if you can make it through the green lantern movie, you can make it through this."
41724,Sheldon,"we can, but thanks to steve jobs, we don’t have to."
41727,Sheldon,"i don’t think so. i believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. for example, uh, wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. see? the twist is that people don’t usually change. well, they don’t."
41728,Sheldon,"wait, if howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game hungry hungry hippos, they eat marbles. maybe i need to dumb these down for you. "
41746,Sheldon,"now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
41748,Sheldon,all of them.
41751,Sheldon,"so, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. where are you going?"
41752,Sheldon,should i follow you?
41753,Sheldon,"leonard, wait."
41755,Sheldon,can’t sleep?
41759,Sheldon,why don’t you ask her?
41761,Sheldon,"no. you’re my friend, and, i’m sorry."
41763,Sheldon,it’s an outrage.
41766,Sheldon,but i don’t want a vacation.
41771,Sheldon,please. what if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and i’m not there to see it?
41772,Sheldon,no. i was just tricking you.
41776,Sheldon,but.
41778,Sheldon,i’m on vacation. what do you think?
41785,Sheldon,let me guess.
41790,Sheldon,"no, i don’t think you are. "
41801,Sheldon,"yeah, no kidding. despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22. "
41802,Sheldon,"he does that to me, too. why do we put up with it?"
41803,Sheldon,i’m fine with it.
41806,Sheldon,"good lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants."
41809,Sheldon,no.
41810,Sheldon,do not stop refreshing your screens.
41811,Sheldon,yay! and they say firefighters are the real heroes.
41815,Sheldon,i can’t believe we wasted all that time on our hulk costumes.
41817,Sheldon,"i told you. buying scalped tickets is against the rules. if you get caught, you get banned from comic-con for life. life, leonard. you’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
41821,Sheldon,"not true. wil thinks this is a great idea. he was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard."
41829,Sheldon,"he is, mr. earl jones, he is."
41840,Sheldon,whose house is this?
41847,Sheldon,i submitted you a notarised list. 
41850,Sheldon,"people usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
41865,Sheldon,get out of town.
41866,Sheldon,"do another one, do another one."
41867,Sheldon,"it’s like there’s a train in your mouth. howard: oh, yeah. i’ve got one. um, the amtrak wolverine coming into chicago. bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. ooo-ooo."
41868,Sheldon,how many trains have you been on?
41875,Sheldon,i never want this day to end.
41880,Sheldon,how is that possible? i’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
41882,Sheldon,what is your problem?
41884,Sheldon,"well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. oh, look, there’s wine. mmm. grape juice that burns. uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? you blinked. i win."
41888,Sheldon,hello.
41889,Sheldon,it was wonderful. 
41898,Sheldon,do you want the long answer or the short answer?
41899,Sheldon,"chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result."
41902,Sheldon,"think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home."
41904,Sheldon,"you, how can you say that? you show me one thing in here we can live without."
41906,Sheldon,"but we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats."
41912,Sheldon,okay. i think we’ve found the problem here. it’s not the table at all. it’s you.
41923,Sheldon,"wait, wait, now, hang on. you think he manipulates me?"
41924,Sheldon,it is hideous.
41926,Sheldon,wait. how do i know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
41929,Sheldon,hello.
41931,Sheldon,which i also figured out by myself.
41933,Sheldon,"which is stronger than ever. this is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was."
41940,Sheldon,she does. 42 minutes in.
41942,Sheldon,"am i missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?"
41947,Sheldon,"nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over."
41953,Sheldon,i have one question. is this a prank where we land in houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a spanish name and then i get arrested and deported to south america?
41963,Sheldon,hello.
41965,Sheldon,"oh, who’s the real astronaut?"
41976,Sheldon,"no, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. i’m not scared at all. oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
41980,Sheldon,kind of like when firefly was cancelled. but not as big.
41984,Sheldon,it wasn’t easy. was it buzz?
41985,Sheldon,i already am. i’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
41994,Sheldon,"i have to. how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i don’t tell her how disappointed i am, and that i’ll never forgive her?"
41995,Sheldon,"no, i’m just going to tell her i’m coming so she can give that good time charlie the heave-ho."
42002,Sheldon,"earlier, i came here to surprise you. i looked in the window and i saw you with a man."
42005,Sheldon,how long have you been involved with him?
42012,Sheldon,i’m a grown man.
42014,Sheldon,no. i’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
42016,Sheldon,i didn’t know she did.
42018,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why."
42021,Sheldon,i am.
42022,Sheldon,"i think what most upsets me about it, mother, is the hypocrisy. doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?"
42025,Sheldon,"mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then i should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. you know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore."
42026,Sheldon,"my point is that you’re going to need to be careful. you used to be protected by your pre-enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex."
42029,Sheldon,"boy, do i have to urinate."
42035,Sheldon,"so, first there was playstation, aka ps1, then ps2, ps3 and now ps4. and that makes sense. you’d think after xbox, there’d be xbox 2. but no, next came xbox 360. hmm? and now, after 360, comes xbox one. why one? maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."
42036,Sheldon,"you know, however, with the xbox one, i can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. up until now, i’ve had to use leonard."
42040,Sheldon,"no, see? well, you absolutely would not. and furthermore, the xbox one now comes with a kinect included."
42047,Sheldon,"oh, of course.  did i mention the ps4 controllers light up?"
42049,Sheldon,"quick poll, ps4 or xbox one? raj?"
42051,Sheldon,leonard?
42059,Sheldon,"old enough to know better. you know, and now that i think about it, i stood in front of a case of ipods and i bought a zune."
42074,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i’ve had a lot on my plate. we happen to live in a golden age of television."
42075,Sheldon,really? did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
42085,Sheldon,"i said leonard, you said no."
42088,Sheldon,"break it off, shake hands, walk away."
42089,Sheldon,"gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"
42092,Sheldon,"oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface."
42096,Sheldon,you stop it.
42101,Sheldon,have you ever even seen a picture of tesla?
42103,Sheldon,she’s right. i’m too hot.
42104,Sheldon,"oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. why do we have a geology book? leonard, did you throw a children’s party while i was in texas?"
42121,Sheldon,not really. i had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
42128,Sheldon,that’s helpful. okay. of these four areas…
42129,Sheldon,it is just so frustrating.
42134,Sheldon,"you’re right. you’re right. got it. we order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. all right, all right, i’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. got it. there’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every thursday night in griffith park and re-enacts battles from lord of the rings."
42135,Sheldon,any chance that restaurant is near griffith park?
42136,Sheldon,all right.
42137,Sheldon,amy’s sick.
42142,Sheldon,"great. you know, this is how anything can happen thursday turns into it won’t stop coming up friday."
42153,Sheldon,i am. so much so that i’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
42155,Sheldon,"this is asian fusion. for all you know, there’s a tiny chihuahua in here."
42165,Sheldon,that’s an easy guess. i’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
42167,Sheldon,"ha. the opposite. she’s a neurobiologist, and i’m a theoretical physicist. my spirit guides can go suck an egg."
42174,Sheldon,"yes. actually, i’m glad you’re here. i’m working on the star wars day schedule. now, i have a window built in after phantom menace for complaining, but i’m worried an hour won’t be enough time."
42178,Sheldon,"your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t."
42190,Sheldon,"okay, here we go. episode i: the phantom menace."
42193,Sheldon,"well, you know what else was just a suggestion? why don’t we change the raisin bran box? hmm? and you know who got hurt by that? every single person who eats breakfast."
42195,Sheldon,arthur. i thought you were dead.
42207,Sheldon,"of course, my grandfather died when i was five. my father died when i was 14."
42212,Sheldon,"that’s true. oh, it’s a good thing i had a nap."
42218,Sheldon,not at all.
42224,Sheldon,i brought my own. no sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
42232,Sheldon,"oh, i’ll make english breakfast tea. they destroyed your culture. that’s close enough. you know, i’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man?"
42240,Sheldon,how many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
42244,Sheldon,"so, who’s watching her now?"
42247,Sheldon,"he said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. he then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face."
42254,Sheldon,"of course. she’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."
42257,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, well, i’ve already given this some thought, and i’m willing to let penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
42261,Sheldon,did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
42262,Sheldon,"well, then, i’m all out of guesses. what? me move across the hall. why would you even suggest such a thing?"
42264,Sheldon,wow.
42282,Sheldon,can you break a twenty?
42285,Sheldon,"boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
42286,Sheldon,don’t be melodramatic. i’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
42290,Sheldon,i suppose it is. except i have a credit card. and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. and i’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
42295,Sheldon,i will.
42306,Sheldon,"oh, yes, please. a pair of pants. and my toothbrush. yeah, and my mail. and a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “i know you are, but what am i?” was met with stony silence."
42311,Sheldon,"you know, sherlock holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. but i’m sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick."
42321,Sheldon,i just thought you were bad at the game.
42322,Sheldon,"amy, may i please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
42326,Sheldon,yes.
42338,Sheldon,"i know. you know, i almost died in a fire in des moines, but i stayed put. fyi, that’s when the imodium gave out."
42339,Sheldon,"i recently read that during world war two, joseph stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas."
42345,Sheldon, guess who?
42346,Sheldon," that’s right, good job. hello. uh, you wanted to see me?"
42360,Sheldon,there is no class.
34192,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. that was me having fun with you. look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. yes, that’s how you say it. but, you possess an intelligence i envy. which leads me to my answer. i would choose the ability to read people’s minds."
42386,Sheldon,"wonderful. now, what about euler-lagrange theorems?"
42389,Sheldon,what are you doing?
34200,Sheldon,"there’s no point, i just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. "
34201,Sheldon,i think this is the place.
42395,Sheldon,well?
42396,Sheldon,are you sure? it just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
34207,Sheldon,what’s the protocol for leaving?
34209,Sheldon,bye-bye
34213,Sheldon,"no, it’s true, i did a series of experiments when i was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
42407,Sheldon,"good, i had cornish game hen."
34217,Sheldon,hi.
34218,Sheldon,hi.
34219,Sheldon,hi.
34224,Sheldon,we never invited louis-slash-louise over.
34225,Sheldon,i have a very wide circle. i have 212 friends on myspace. 
42418,Sheldon,it’s called parallel play.
34227,Sheldon,chat? we don’t chat. at least not offline.
42423,Sheldon,absolutely not.
34232,Sheldon,actually that’s my work.
42425,Sheldon,"everything is quantifiable. that french fry? a seven. spider-man? a nine. the number nine? oddly, only a four."
34234,Sheldon,yeah. 
42426,Sheldon,"no, i’m not. french fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. which is why a curly fry only gets a two. if i wanted curls for dinner, i’d order a clown wig."
42432,Sheldon,"the answer is one simple test away. hmm? you know, it’s like when i thought there was a possum in my closet. did i sit around wondering? no, i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."
42434,Sheldon,"we got an eight-point-two. trust me, you’re happy."
42437,Sheldon,who’s the bobblehead of?
42438,Sheldon,"no, as long as it bobbles."
42439,Sheldon,"okay, new plan. we go to disneyland, play hide and seek on tom sawyer’s island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch."
34248,Sheldon,i resent you saying we don’t have company.
42441,Sheldon,"oh, i think that sounds wonderful."
34250,Sheldon,"yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
42445,Sheldon,i go to the bathroom like everybody else.
34255,Sheldon,yes. 
34256,Sheldon,yes. 
42450,Sheldon,"oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies."
42452,Sheldon,"i’ll give you a plan right now. step one, open comic book store. step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
34262,Sheldon,"so, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
42455,Sheldon,yes.
34271,Sheldon,"event a. a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. event b. we drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
42463,Sheldon,if only penny had said that once in a while.
34273,Sheldon,you think with your penis.
42464,Sheldon,"yeah, he’s right. once, in a moment of candour, i told amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. she stormed out. which was sad, because we were playing scrabble, and i had all the letters to spell persimmon."
34275,Sheldon,no i don’t. and neither do you.
42468,Sheldon,"now, before i start, i need you to know that i’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. so, keep an open mind."
34277,Sheldon,so we get to have a scene with him?
42469,Sheldon,"perfect. now, i’m considering investing in stuart’s comic book store."
42472,Sheldon,"it would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace."
34281,Sheldon,"leonard, the tv is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
42475,Sheldon,i remember it distinctly because i had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of dr. seuss’s death.
34284,Sheldon,what do you think their combined iq is?
42478,Sheldon,"well, don’t feel bad. i think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
34292,Sheldon,well you got me out of my pants.
34296,Sheldon,"thank you. you’re not done with her, are you?"
34303,Sheldon,"you don’t need chopsticks, this is thai food."
34305,Sheldon,hi.
34306,Sheldon,"don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women."
34313,Sheldon,challenge accepted.  we’re locked out.
42507,Sheldon,"yeah, he’s right. oh, here’s a thought. what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
34321,Sheldon,you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
34322,Sheldon,"yeah, those are men who just had sex."
42513,Sheldon,you said quantum coupling. that made me think of the show quantum leap. that’s a tangent and it’s your fault.
34325,Sheldon,"no, it hurt…  great caesar’s ghost, look at this place?"
42517,Sheldon,leonard’s right. we can’t just jump ahead. we have to watch the whole movie.
42518,Sheldon,but we didn’t see them bust one ghost.
34328,Sheldon,"excuse me, but i think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
34330,Sheldon,straightening up.
42525,Sheldon,"i’m always busy. this mind is capable of advanced multitasking. you know, currently, i’m attempting to solve the penrose conjecture, i’m composing my nobel acceptance speech for when i’ve solved the penrose conjecture, and i’m wondering how mermaids have babies."
42527,Sheldon,"well, i’m from texas and you’re from india, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. next."
42528,Sheldon,"yeah, i have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. next."
34337,Sheldon,"penny, i just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. i’m here for you."
42529,Sheldon,yeah? we have to be somewhere.
34341,Sheldon,don’t be ridiculous. i have no peers.
34343,Sheldon,"evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. if you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
34344,Sheldon,"no,  that’s ridiculous."
34348,Sheldon,"i have to say, i slept splendidly. granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
42544,Sheldon,"just the hits.  where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew."
34355,Sheldon,"goodbye, honey puffs, hello big bran."
34356,Sheldon,"really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
42547,Sheldon,"then i’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."
34358,Sheldon,"depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  oh!"
42548,Sheldon,who’s he?
34362,Sheldon,"i am truly sorry for what happened last night, i take full responsibility. and i hope that it won’t colour your opinion of leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, i hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  i did what i could."
42556,Sheldon,"some york peppermint patties, a couple of dr. peppers, and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show called hannah montana."
34365,Sheldon,check.
42557,Sheldon,"as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature."
34368,Sheldon,"run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. "
42560,Sheldon,we’re not stopping.
42564,Sheldon,voyager the space probe or voyager the star trek tv show?
42567,Sheldon,"you’re not doing it for me. you’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  sheldon’s mine simulation log, entry four. my kit kat has melted. all is lost."
34380,Sheldon,penny for your thoughts. 
42575,Sheldon,"ooh, siam palace?"
42576,Sheldon,"uh, mee krob and chicken satay?"
42578,Sheldon,"eh, well, very well. oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak."
42579,Sheldon,why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? we can both play this game.
42580,Sheldon,"hold on, doctor. leonard, where are your social skills? this man is clearly upset. we should invite him in for a hot beverage."
34396,Sheldon,"okay, look, i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. nevertheless, i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. you did not ask her out. "
42590,Sheldon,"yes. if you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure."
42591,Sheldon,"oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. all the squares have been purchased."
34404,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
42596,Sheldon,you can do this.
34406,Sheldon,"if i could of, i would of. "
34407,Sheldon,is the sex starting now?
34409,Sheldon,"alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
34416,Sheldon,got it. so i’m assuming nothing venereal. i’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
42608,Sheldon,"i may be an alien, but i have urges. if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, i will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. i’m not the best at reading facial cues, but i can see that you’re a little turned on."
34418,Sheldon,why would she be expecting me? 
34420,Sheldon,score one for liquor and poor judgement.
34424,Sheldon,"it’s time travel, leonard, i will have already done that. "
42621,Sheldon,i don’t think that’s a good idea.
34430,Sheldon,do you know there are only eight consonants in the hawaiian language.
42622,Sheldon,"according to an online message board, i may be having a panic attack. soccermom09 had similar symptoms. but to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day."
34433,Sheldon,an actual real scientist.  how was that?
34434,Sheldon,i can’t believe he fired me.
42625,Sheldon,i really did think you looked pretty.
42626,Sheldon,yes. so much so that i started to panic.
34437,Sheldon,"this isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment. "
34438,Sheldon,"i finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
42628,Sheldon,thank you for understanding.
34440,Sheldon,"i don’t want my job back. i’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. before that i spent four years working on my thesis. before that i was in college, and before that, i was in the fifth grade. this is my first day off in decades, and i’m going to savour it."
34441,Sheldon,"i’m not just fixing my eggs, i’m fixing everyone’s eggs."
42630,Sheldon,there’s no denying i have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite. but that seems even more farfetched. the only conclusion was love. i know what’s happening. this is a panic attack. soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
34443,Sheldon,"oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
34446,Sheldon,"never mind, you won’t get it right, i’d better come with you."
42639,Sheldon,"yes, for the first five or six years, but i’ve gotten used to it. it helps me sleep. he’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine."
42641,Sheldon,i believe it was your turn in the game.
34450,Sheldon,or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
34451,Sheldon,"slow down. slow down, please slow down."
34456,Sheldon,"fine. we’re travelling forward at, good lord, 51 miles an hour. now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."
34457,Sheldon,"this is great. look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. "
34459,Sheldon,"uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
34460,Sheldon,"no, this is fun. oh, the thing about tomatoes, and i think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit. "
42651,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, i’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."
42656,Sheldon,"i do. i have the drive to the hospital right here. that is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. and don’t expect me to carry you, i do that enough in life."
42657,Sheldon,you don’t know that.
42661,Sheldon,18 parts per million. and he’s still doing it.
34470,Sheldon,it’s an experiment. 
34475,Sheldon,shhhhh!
42673,Sheldon,"oh, stop it. i assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
42678,Sheldon,"i suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
34488,Sheldon,yeah.
34491,Sheldon,"i’m not going to apologise, i didn’t say anything that wasn’t true. "
34492,Sheldon,why not?
42690,Sheldon,you know this is all your fault.
42691,Sheldon,i told you not to get the surgery.
42693,Sheldon,"oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. you still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. the minute you sneeze web, i’m moving out."
42699,Sheldon,"hello. i’m doctor sheldon cooper, and welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags, the final episode flagtacular. i knew it was coming. still scary. now, i’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? who will stand between us and flag ignorance?"
42703,Sheldon,"and you said you pressed record. anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. and, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the stewards of gondor, and the japanese minamoto clan, but i’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, white flags, who’s wavin’ ‘em and why?"
42708,Sheldon,"crikey, what flag do we have today?"
34522,Sheldon,"oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. last time i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse. "
34527,Sheldon,"hi, leonard. it’s me, sheldon. in the living room. i just, i wanted you to know i saw the tie. message received. you’re welcome. you carry on. give my best to lesley. "
34529,Sheldon,"my equations, someone’s tampered with my equations. "
34535,Sheldon,who told you you could touch my board?
34538,Sheldon,"inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. "
42732,Sheldon,"you, at least listen to the premise. since you were born in germany, i thought we could talk"
42733,Sheldon,"you know, speaking of attorneys, if i ever needed a lawyer, i would not hire she-hulk."
34547,Sheldon,"you know, i think i may have misjudged this restaurant. "
34548,Sheldon,"i won’t go out on a limb, but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger. "
42746,Sheldon,"with gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. if i show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible."
34557,Sheldon,"i was giving clear, concise orders. "
42751,Sheldon,"i do. now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless."
34563,Sheldon,"yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? "
42759,Sheldon,of course it is. it’s the perfect gift. how are you feeling right now? guilty? sad? wishing you were jewish?
34570,Sheldon,"if i have to, i can demonstrate. neeeeoooowwwww!"
34571,Sheldon,"well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
34572,Sheldon,"well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with lewis leakey, a great anthropologist. it had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. "
34573,Sheldon,and you said the party starts at seven. 
42764,Sheldon,"i can’t believe this. you’re happy, i’m happy. well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… get your hand out of that box."
42771,Sheldon,you want to be green?
34580,Sheldon,"i’m confused. if there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? "
34582,Sheldon,and that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
34588,Sheldon,"oh, i hardly think so. "
42781,Sheldon,"well, once again, it’s what i do."
34591,Sheldon,hello.
34592,Sheldon,me? i’ll give you a hint. neeeeooooowwwww!
34596,Sheldon,"yes, well, i’m the doppler effect. "
42788,Sheldon,"let’s see, my armies are going to attack the shire from buckland. and i roll a five and a three."
34598,Sheldon,what do you suppose he’s doing here? besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
42791,Sheldon,"i don’t know why you’re so surprised. if there’s one thing i know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise."
34604,Sheldon,true. why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
34609,Sheldon,i’m not. no offence. 
42801,Sheldon,"you know what? you think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. yeah, you think that i don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but i do. hmm? i have excellent peripheral vision. on a good day, i can see my ears."
42805,Sheldon,it’s okay.
34614,Sheldon,"happy halloween.  if it’s any consolation, i thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. "
42810,Sheldon,when i’m not home.
34619,Sheldon,he’s not here. maybe the avenger summoned him. 
42812,Sheldon,it’s not a basket. it’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century china.
42813,Sheldon,i saw that.
42816,Sheldon,"aw, now i’m sad i didn’t hear it."
42820,Sheldon,"how could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
42821,Sheldon,i’m not going to work today. and would you like to know why?
34633,Sheldon,mine. 
34636,Sheldon,"raj, raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
42829,Sheldon,and to clarify?
34638,Sheldon,what?
42831,Sheldon,"boy, i’m not nearly as mysterious as i think i am."
42832,Sheldon,"yeah, i was, but after talking to penny, i realised something. i, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. and second, the reason i may not be progressing in my research is i’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself."
42833,Sheldon,"according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. so i’d like to ask you all to do something for me. keep me on my toes. just throw me off my game. essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
34643,Sheldon,"hold that thought, leonard, a moment."
34644,Sheldon,where do i begin? 
42836,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
34647,Sheldon,"so, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. "
34648,Sheldon,no-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. 
34650,Sheldon,"okay, well since i’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, i use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly. "
34651,Sheldon,i suggest no liquids after 11pm. 
42844,Sheldon,"really? oh, that’s fantastic. now, wait, they’re dropping. why are they dropping?"
42845,Sheldon,"oh, that is infuriating. ooh, look, they went back up again. terrific. oh, no, they went back down."
42849,Sheldon,"oh, no, it will. see, by keeping my mind engaged, i’ll become more focused."
42852,Sheldon,"i ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it."
42854,Sheldon,"you guys are the worst. thank you, i think that was helpful."
34664,Sheldon,"well then, it’s all settled, christie will stay with howard, penny can go back to her apartment, and i’ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who, although at this point it’s more like doctor why bother. "
34665,Sheldon,"no more talking, everybody go. "
42862,Sheldon,"oh. uh, i need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so i’m using darth vader, the joker, and godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. uh, i tried including taylor swift in the mix, but turns out i love her."
34674,Sheldon,"and divide it how, i’m telling you we cannot do this without wolowitz. "
42868,Sheldon,i know. it’s replaced godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
42872,Sheldon,"but after months of struggling, i’m finally making progress."
34682,Sheldon,"you can’t go out, it’s halo night. "
34684,Sheldon, then it’s not dancing night. 
42881,Sheldon,"okay. hey, i thought you were trying to trick me."
42882,Sheldon,"no, no, comfort is the enemy. you know what’s comfortable? slippers and blankets and panda bears. imagine a panda bear with richard feynman’s face on it. warm up the car, leonard, it’s poster time."
34694,Sheldon,shhh! 
42887,Sheldon,of course not.
34700,Sheldon,"the online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable id, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable id takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare. "
42892,Sheldon,i like it. i think you’re on to something.
34704,Sheldon,"if i may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
34708,Sheldon,i suggest you go through with it.
34711,Sheldon,"no need, we have the special edition. "
34714,Sheldon,i’ll have a diet coke.
34716,Sheldon,"yes, "
34719,Sheldon,bartenders are supposed to have people skills. 
42912,Sheldon,who wrote that?
34723,Sheldon,"in a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
42916,Sheldon,can i respond now?
42919,Sheldon,"my good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. in fact, we are experts in our fields. and while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. and later tonight, your mother."
34731,Sheldon,you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess punchali. 
34733,Sheldon,you indian.
34735,Sheldon,i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can. 
42928,Sheldon,"oh, okay, okay, calm down.  it’s him. he’s trying to video chat. perhaps i shouldn’t have taken this into the real world."
42929,Sheldon,interesting. i can’t think of a single thing i wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
42934,Sheldon,"good to see you again, mr. stephen-hawking liked-our-paper."
42935,Sheldon,"i’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?"
34745,Sheldon,and may i point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring. 
34747,Sheldon,"okay, well, good night."
34750,Sheldon,"look at me, look at me, i’ve got goosebumps. "
42943,Sheldon,"oh, really? when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?"
42944,Sheldon,"that’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. but that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along."
34753,Sheldon,they found the remote controlled cars.
34755,Sheldon,"you know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. "
42953,Sheldon,"ugh, let it go. i have heard that my whole life. every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way i feel."
34764,Sheldon,it doesn’t need proving. 
34768,Sheldon,"no, once again, i’m throwing you a bone. and once again, you are welcome. "
42961,Sheldon,okay.
34773,Sheldon,huh.
42975,Sheldon,i can’t. i’m naked.
34785,Sheldon,then why did you say it.
34786,Sheldon,were you trying to impress penny?
42977,Sheldon,thank you.
42981,Sheldon,but i think it would be comforting.
42989,Sheldon,"in the interest of science, i’d be willing to."
34799,Sheldon,then i’ll settle for an aneurysm. 
42992,Sheldon,"just out of curiosity, penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to lake geneva, wisconsin for gary con? it’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of gary gygax, the co-creator of dungeons and dragons."
34804,Sheldon,"i really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, i came, there’s just no pleasing you. "
42997,Sheldon,hmm. living or dead?
34809,Sheldon,"okay, then riddle me this. assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor, why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
43001,Sheldon,what would constitute a perfect day for you?
34811,Sheldon,", too late, i win. "
34812,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. ."
34813,Sheldon,"i don’t guess. as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as i’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. "
34814,Sheldon,i have a conclusion based on an observation.
43005,Sheldon,"uh, i wake up. uh, i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup. uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
34816,Sheldon,i think that’s a week from tuesday at six. 
43006,Sheldon,who do you think made the french toast with butter and syrup?
34820,Sheldon,"no, i imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago. "
43013,Sheldon,"well, i’m not. and if i could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler."
43020,Sheldon,thank you.
34829,Sheldon,is that a relevant factor? 
43021,Sheldon,you’re making it difficult to love you right now.
43022,Sheldon,that’s it. we’re done with the questions.
43028,Sheldon,"of course you are, i’m warm and soothing. i’m like a human bowl of tomato soup."
34840,Sheldon, good morning.
34844,Sheldon,"he lied, and i’m feeling very uncomfortable about it."
43037,Sheldon,thank you for walking me home.
43040,Sheldon,"oh, good. you’re back."
34849,Sheldon,"yea, who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee, remember that, it’s important. "
43041,Sheldon,"as you know, amy and i have been together a long time, and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible."
43043,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43046,Sheldon,"after much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. they don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise."
43051,Sheldon,"i know. i like him, too. hi, little guy. how’d you like to come home with us? you’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house."
43052,Sheldon,or if they accept daddy’s application to live on mars.
34866,Sheldon,"no, no, no, leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy."
43061,Sheldon,"first of all, this has only made me stronger. but beyond that, all i did was fill out an application."
34870,Sheldon,"you didn’t read the bio, did you? he’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
43062,Sheldon,is there anything i can do to cheer you up?
34872,Sheldon,fine.  we’ll talk in the morning.
34873,Sheldon,"excuse me, we just went over this. as the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
43063,Sheldon,what if i play the star trek theme on my nose?
43064,Sheldon,"yep, you’re mad."
34876,Sheldon,"well, you see, while leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
43067,Sheldon,but i made a video.
34878,Sheldon,"subtextually, of course.  morning penny."
43070,Sheldon,"amy. oh, why didn’t i give her sleepy time tea? amy, wait. getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
34880,Sheldon,"but we did convince him to leave the motel. come say hello. leo, this is penny, our friend and neighbour."
34884,Sheldon,your parents made the right decision. 
34886,Sheldon,checkmate.
43079,Sheldon,"two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. and that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
34888,Sheldon,it must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. 
34889,Sheldon,from the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. all you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. 
43080,Sheldon,"oh, look, it’s the scientific american that covered the paper leonard and i wrote."
34896,Sheldon,what?
34900,Sheldon,we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment. and having never been to nebraska i’m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies. 
43095,Sheldon,"oh, right. this is a disaster."
43102,Sheldon,"it is. they’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. it’ll only make you feel worse."
43109,Sheldon,he said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
34918,Sheldon,in the lab?
34922,Sheldon,you’re a carrier. all these people here are doomed. you’re doomed! 
34923,Sheldon,i want soup.
34924,Sheldon,"penny, i have an iq of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home i would have thought of it?"
43117,Sheldon,is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
34927,Sheldon,can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
43122,Sheldon,"indeed. penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day."
43126,Sheldon,"well said, old chap. i thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. starting today, it’ll go gettysburg address, i have a dream, and what he just said."
34940,Sheldon,agreed. 
43135,Sheldon,hang on. physics today mentioned the paper.
34948,Sheldon,little ball of fur. keep rubbing. 
34951,Sheldon,do you think penny will come here and take care of us? 
43147,Sheldon,"i suppose it is. in fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, i’d be okay with that."
43151,Sheldon,and this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?
34961,Sheldon,"excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
34962,Sheldon,"you can count on us, we’re on it. what the hell do you mean, dead end. "
43155,Sheldon,will our hotel room be ready?
34966,Sheldon,"oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. goodbye. "
34971,Sheldon,get him out leonard.
34972,Sheldon,"yes, in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it. "
34973,Sheldon,fourteen and a half.
34974,Sheldon,"fifteen years old. dennis kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to… you know, that other guy."
43166,Sheldon,"there’s a speaker box. drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens."
43170,Sheldon,"all right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
43174,Sheldon,"oh, you are killing me."
43176,Sheldon,"shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man."
34987,Sheldon,are you sure? 
34988,Sheldon,"pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
43184,Sheldon,are you still mad at me?
43185,Sheldon,"boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
34995,Sheldon,"uh, huh. so it’s a shelf? "
43187,Sheldon,"well, not only did we go to skywalker ranch, we got in. and no one we know can say that. and for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser."
43188,Sheldon,see?
43190,Sheldon,that’s amazing.
43191,Sheldon,"and i saw jabba the hutt riding by on a motorcycle. although that was right after the tasing, so who can say for sure?"
43198,Sheldon,sure. it’s not like i was invited to richard feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
43201,Sheldon,you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff.
35010,Sheldon,said pharoah to moses. 
43206,Sheldon,"i can just picture them all right now at feynman’s house, probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing schrodinger. see? they’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
35016,Sheldon,you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? would you ask picasso to play pictionary? would you ask noah webster to play boggle? would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish? 
43209,Sheldon,i’ll get the blankets. you google how to have childlike fun.
35020,Sheldon,"i don’t. teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
43214,Sheldon,"okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, fort knox, fort ticonderoga, fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket."
43219,Sheldon,that’s a big step.
43220,Sheldon,"very well. i will agree to a family-friendly, g-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
35029,Sheldon,by that logic i should answer all the anthropology questions because i’m a mammal.  
43223,Sheldon,"it would, but you know how much i admire preparedness. how did you know we’d be in the living room?"
35034,Sheldon,"oh please, you don’t even have a phd. "
35035,Sheldon,"good idea, i need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury. "
35036,Sheldon,"leonard, excellent, i want to show you something."
43228,Sheldon,not there. that’s my spot.
43232,Sheldon,thank you. do either of you know beyoncé? i’d love her to get behind it.
43242,Sheldon,"oh, wait. no. how about we split the difference and discuss why austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
43243,Sheldon,"hmm. i know exactly what you should do. unfortunately, i cannot tell you."
35054,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is technetium."
43247,Sheldon,mmm.
43248,Sheldon,are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
35059,Sheldon,how do you know anything about physics?
43255,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
43257,Sheldon,certainly.
43259,Sheldon,tonight works better for me.
35071,Sheldon,who?
35076,Sheldon,formal protest. 
35077,Sheldon,"well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
35081,Sheldon,there’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
43278,Sheldon,all i see is a black screen. and my own reflection. i look sad.
35087,Sheldon,"it’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
35090,Sheldon,"oh, i never joke when it comes to vertigo. "
43283,Sheldon,"all right, that seems simple enough. initiating calibration sequence. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. well, i suppose ten is technically at least ten. but they’re still getting at least one angry letter."
35093,Sheldon,"the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor from victorian england into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling eloy. "
35094,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i know we said we’d take turns, but i think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here. "
35095,Sheldon,"alright, i think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, i propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. "
35096,Sheldon,"hold on. bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? "
43288,Sheldon,"oh, no."
43290,Sheldon,"you know what they all do, right?"
35099,Sheldon,"wait a minute, i’d want to see that too. "
43293,Sheldon,"so, can you get it working?"
35102,Sheldon,"if i remember correctly, captain kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stardate 5027.3, which will be january 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
35103,Sheldon,time machine. 
43297,Sheldon,you can’t return it. howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
35110,Sheldon,it won’t change the past. 
43307,Sheldon,that’s what my train used to do.
35120,Sheldon,what are you doing?
35127,Sheldon,"who cares, as long as you pick me. "
43322,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
35131,Sheldon,we have to get rid of the time machine. 
43324,Sheldon,"beverly, would you like to see the math i worked out to support our hypothesis?"
35135,Sheldon,buddy.
43331,Sheldon,"well, i had just begun puberty. it was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."
43335,Sheldon,"oh, sure."
43338,Sheldon,do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
35149,Sheldon,made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
43346,Sheldon,"perhaps. but my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever i wanted, so who cares?"
35162,Sheldon,i hadn’t considered that. we do share dna.
43354,Sheldon,whenever you’re ready.
35165,Sheldon,"alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it i say. i’m going to settle this right now. neither of you are good enough for my sister. "
35166,Sheldon,"you’re out too, by the way."
35167,Sheldon,"it’s nothing personal, i’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie. "
35168,Sheldon,"now that leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. "
43358,Sheldon,"amy’s mad at me, and i’m not clear why."
43361,Sheldon,"baffling, right? we were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. i stopped so i could ask the question. next thing i know, good-bye, kissy face. hello, yelly face."
35173,Sheldon,oops. 
35174,Sheldon,why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   
35176,Sheldon,"let me explain. you see, i’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. "
35177,Sheldon,"that would be you. but residing within you is the potential for another me. perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a sheldon 2.0 if you will. "
43369,Sheldon,that’s right. it’s called foreplay. and i could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
43372,Sheldon,okay.
35182,Sheldon,"you donate eggs. we will place them in cryogenic storage. i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. "
35183,Sheldon,correction. missy can date whoever she wants. 
43375,Sheldon,"yeah, shut up, sheldon."
35188,Sheldon,you tell people i’m a rocket scientist?
43384,Sheldon,it’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
43390,Sheldon,oh.
43391,Sheldon,okay.
43394,Sheldon,good. don’t do it.
35206,Sheldon,"well of course i… oh! yeah, i have an idea, let’s throw leonard a kick ass birthday party."
35210,Sheldon,luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. 
35214,Sheldon,"i accept your premise, i reject your conclusion."
43406,Sheldon,"when last we spoke, you said you needed time."
43407,Sheldon,"the lord of the rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. i made you watch that, you said it was an eternity."
35218,Sheldon,"you mean, like a sweater? "
43414,Sheldon,we make everyone feel awkward. that’s our thing.
35223,Sheldon,because of the two additional ethernet ports.
43416,Sheldon,i see. and is that why everybody was invited but me?
43417,Sheldon,"raj, you’re probably wondering why amy and i aren’t showing any affection to one another."
43419,Sheldon,you hear that? raj is devastated.
35229,Sheldon,what twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? 
35244,Sheldon,that’s what you did. i assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
43438,Sheldon,mandy chao?
35247,Sheldon,mai du lui tsa.
35248,Sheldon,"my apologies leonard, i’m only as good as my teacher. "
35251,Sheldon,"not surprising. penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex. the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk. "
43444,Sheldon,do what makes her happy? she plays the harp and her car is paid for. how much happier can she be?
35253,Sheldon,"twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. you’d also have to be knighted for that to apply. "
43446,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no. we are done here. would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
43448,Sheldon,would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
43449,Sheldon,you would never kiss me and make me say i love you and then break up with me.
35261,Sheldon,"yes, i suppose he is. "
43458,Sheldon,i’m currently single.
43463,Sheldon,great. see you in about half an hour.
35273,Sheldon,"i would not say that. no-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. "
43470,Sheldon,wait. don’t you want to go through it to make sure i haven’t forgotten anything?
43474,Sheldon,"hey, you broke up with me. it is none of your business whose naked bosom i’m smooshing around like pizza dough."
35284,Sheldon,"a mistake involving penny? okay, you’ll have to narrow it down. "
35286,Sheldon,other people might be interested. 
43479,Sheldon,bring penny to meet mandy.
43480,Sheldon,"well, right now, penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
43481,Sheldon,and we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
43482,Sheldon,yes. and that’s coming from me.
43484,Sheldon,"hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to sheldon cooper presents: fun with flags. you may notice that i’m holding a remote control. that’s because my cameraperson and co-host, dr. amy farrah fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. i’m going to pause here to let that sink in. okay. if you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. but the show must go on. and thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. we’re here to talk about flags. tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women i have a feeling were responsible."
43488,Sheldon,"yeah, there’s fisherman’s wharf and alcatraz and cable cars. we’re gonna have so much fun."
43491,Sheldon,she watched it. i’m gonna get that girl back.
43492,Sheldon,she was listening through the door. she wants me.
43494,Sheldon,is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
43496,Sheldon,"well, i’d hardly call this kidnapping. where’s the blindfold? where’s the duct tape? where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and i try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before i can trace it and then i say i’m getting too old for this crud?"
43498,Sheldon,"oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?"
43500,Sheldon,it’s bad enough i’m being taken against my will. i don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
35315,Sheldon,so you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
35316,Sheldon,"interesting. see, one more question, and perhaps i should have led with this, when did we become friends? "
35319,Sheldon,"why are you asking me, i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me, nor do i have any method of learning such things.  "
35322,Sheldon,well i might ask you the same question. why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? but exist between you and penny. a person to whom i barely speak.  
43521,Sheldon,"oh, please, the hulk would never get across the border with that temper."
43524,Sheldon,we do?
35337,Sheldon,uh-oh.
43536,Sheldon,"you know what they don’t sell at the container store? something large enough to contain my disappointment. although, if anyone did, it would be them."
35345,Sheldon,"no, that’s fine. i’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. "
35346,Sheldon,"now, only if you want to."
43540,Sheldon,"yeah, i know, top ten, pretty exciting."
43542,Sheldon,perhaps i could find someone better than leonard. someone i can rub in his face. chris pratt’s all the rage right now. i wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
35351,Sheldon,"that makes halle berry my fifth favourite catwoman. there’s julie newmar, michelle pfieffer, eartha kitt, lee meriwether…"
35353,Sheldon,"but she’s not my favourite of the x-men, in order that would be wolverine, cyclops, oh wait, i forgot professor x. professor x, wolverine, cyclops, iceman, then storm, angel, the beast, oh wait, nightcrawler. professor x, nightcrawler, wolverine, cyclops, iceman, then storm, angel…."
35355,Sheldon,i’m ba-ack!
43552,Sheldon,"i was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then i realized what i want to ask you is why is there a band-aid on your forearm, but then i realized what i really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
43553,Sheldon,"you’re healthy. you have a job in the sciences. i’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner."
43555,Sheldon,"i suppose. what happened to me, amy? years ago i was completely disengaged from my feelings. i’d say it was a happier time, but i was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?"
43560,Sheldon,"hello, 2003."
43564,Sheldon,they are in 2003.
35373,Sheldon,"don’t be silly, i borrowed one of your pillow cases."
35376,Sheldon,"her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
35384,Sheldon,"but it’s friday. friday’s always vintage game night. look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where i left off in 1999 when i had pernicious anaemia."
35386,Sheldon,"oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
35387,Sheldon,"well, statistically speaking…"
43585,Sheldon,when can i stab one of my friends?
35398,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
43590,Sheldon,my last physical.
35401,Sheldon,i don’t like bearclaws.
43595,Sheldon,"yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb."
43606,Sheldon,you’re forgetting something. ladies love jocks.
35415,Sheldon,i’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? or in your case the old community college try?
35416,Sheldon,leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
35417,Sheldon,"yes, the doctor doom to my mr fantastic. the doctor octopus to my spiderman. the doctor sivana to my captain marvel."
43612,Sheldon,and kind of delicious. i wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
35429,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my friend. and friends support their friends, apparently. so i am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie."
43622,Sheldon,"before i tell you, perhaps i should soften the blow. you’re face is pleasingly symmetrical."
35432,Sheldon,balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
35438,Sheldon,"fellow warriors, this is sheldor the conqueror. we are about to enter axel’s fortress. now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. alright barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
43630,Sheldon,not a chance.
35441,Sheldon,would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
43638,Sheldon,"really? you know i don’t like buying things at night. january 7th, 2009, i went to the ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up cracklin’ oat bran for the morning and what did i see?"
43646,Sheldon,"huh. all right, do it. tell him we’re in."
43651,Sheldon,"wait, hold on, hold on. how do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?"
43652,Sheldon,exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. you give us the helium first.
35461,Sheldon,"you’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
35462,Sheldon,"well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
43654,Sheldon,"well, he is. i’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. it’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. you’re a sketchy character in a parking garage."
35465,Sheldon,do you have the enchanted sword?
43657,Sheldon,"not necessarily. uh, many argue the essence of a mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
43659,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. see, you’re getting it."
35472,Sheldon,"danger, danger."
35473,Sheldon,you’re in my bedroom.
35474,Sheldon,people can’t be in my bedroom.
35475,Sheldon,i’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
35476,Sheldon,i spilled grape juice.
35477,Sheldon,"i can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my monday pyjamas. penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
35478,Sheldon,you were invited on a quest to the black castle?
35482,Sheldon,"here’s the problem. i was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in buckman 204, and dr winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
35483,Sheldon,"if it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then i plead guilty.  oh, penny!"
43675,Sheldon,"anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way."
35485,Sheldon,"oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. dr gablehauser, i have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. all she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
43681,Sheldon,"well, the swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison."
43682,Sheldon,"it scared me straight, leonard."
35491,Sheldon,yes.
35508,Sheldon,drink a healing potion.
35517,Sheldon,i’m surprised you struck out with penny. apparently she’s a big old five.
43711,Sheldon,no. she broke up with me before i could broach the subject.
43715,Sheldon,"oh, no, he broke my collarbone. i can still hear it click."
35528,Sheldon,"yeah, but exactly who are these people? what are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
43721,Sheldon,hello.
35530,Sheldon,"oh, there’s my missing neutrino. you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic dickens?"
43733,Sheldon,"no, i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyper-focus on my work again."
35545,Sheldon,aaaah!
43737,Sheldon,"well, it was the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me. now that i’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that i employ your services once again."
43738,Sheldon,"oh, no, it’s all right. i think of my time with amy as a stick of fruit stripe gum. sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."
35548,Sheldon,"there’s a tribe in papua new guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. "
35551,Sheldon,now?
35554,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white?"
43746,Sheldon,and i have the soulful eyes of a cow.
43753,Sheldon,someone will show.
43754,Sheldon,"well, by that logic, i should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? not to cast aspersions, but i can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that."
43755,Sheldon,one minute is a long time.
35566,Sheldon,"while others mourned lucky, i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
43759,Sheldon,"oh, fine, i won’t shut my heart to the love of jennifer lawrence."
43760,Sheldon,"sounds like a drama queen. oh, no. it is jennifer lawrence."
43761,Sheldon,all right. can i help you?
43762,Sheldon,yes.
35571,Sheldon,"that’s one option, but who has the time? but consider this, the japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at disney, next thing you know, we’re playing halo with a multi-lingual abraham lincoln."
43770,Sheldon,"no. they’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year i finally touch a starfish. anyway, i wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like."
43772,Sheldon,you don’t think that will be awkward?
35581,Sheldon,but how am i going to get to work?
35583,Sheldon,"i didn’t try, i succeeded. for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to de-bus."
35586,Sheldon,leonard’s asleep.
43784,Sheldon,"all right. well, what should we talk about?"
43787,Sheldon,all right.
35598,Sheldon,"studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
35600,Sheldon,you’re going up euclid avenue?
35603,Sheldon,"the answer’s tricky. it’s second street. you see, you’d think it would be first street, but in most towns, first street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like main street, broad street, michigan avenue. leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. we also play games. would you like to play one?"
43796,Sheldon,oh. would you care to play an ocean-themed game i invented?
43798,Sheldon,what is that?
35607,Sheldon,okay. i’ll give it a shot. 
35608,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, there you are, i’m ready to go home."
43800,Sheldon,"i’ll start you off easy. electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp."
35611,Sheldon,"now, how do you propose i get home?"
35612,Sheldon,penny. but i sense that’s no longer an option.
43803,Sheldon,"hey, let’s not pull at that thread. okay. i’ll fight spongebob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. um, i’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem i’m having with my current friends. which means i’ll have to eat the hagfish."
35615,Sheldon,"whether or not he was trying to kill me. for the record, i maintain he was. where are you going?"
43808,Sheldon,did you have a nice time?
43809,Sheldon,"well, i can’t take all the credit. it was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."
43813,Sheldon,"sheldon cooper’s descent into madness, day two. it’s 2:25 a.m., and i feel the urge to urinate. my normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here i am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. it’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. i suppose i should pee while i still know what a toilet is."
43815,Sheldon,"are you sure? sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise."
35629,Sheldon,examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
35630,Sheldon,i’m actually more of a theorist.
35631,Sheldon,oh.
43823,Sheldon,"this is penny. she is your friend. if she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. you probably paid for it, anyway."
35637,Sheldon,"no, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
43830,Sheldon,empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. and pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
43835,Sheldon,it’s about amy.
35644,Sheldon,"you know the pale blue of luke skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
35645,Sheldon,i haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
35646,Sheldon,"click. now, are there air bags?"
35650,Sheldon,"i don’t know. i was on the pasadena freeway, i missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
43845,Sheldon,the web site’s frozen. i can’t get in.
35663,Sheldon,"in short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. any questions? of course not. i weep for the future of science. now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of batman is out. come, leonard."
43857,Sheldon,yes. but she knows how important star wars is to me.
35669,Sheldon,it’s what i do.
43866,Sheldon,"no, i can’t. i need to make preparations for amy’s birthday. which leads me to the following bit of business. this is my ticket to star wars. i don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. i trust you’ll give it to someone worthy."
35680,Sheldon,yes.
43877,Sheldon,"which do you think she’d prefer? because i checked the sheep and wool festival web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left."
35686,Sheldon,"oh, good one."
35687,Sheldon,"well, to paraphrase mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, i just have to put them in the right order."
43880,Sheldon,you’re back.
35689,Sheldon,"yes, i’m close to a breakthrough. ooh, it tickles"
43890,Sheldon,"hello. sorry i’m late. i also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and i chased it for a while."
43893,Sheldon,"no, no, no. it’s your birthday. as long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, i’ll be fine."
43899,Sheldon,"you know what, let me pull a quick contract off the internet."
35708,Sheldon,"yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
43901,Sheldon,all right. hello.
35711,Sheldon,shh! ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
43909,Sheldon,"oh. uh, uh, she liked it fine. but she doesn’t have the history with the franchise i do."
35719,Sheldon,rats.
43913,Sheldon,all right. enjoy the neurobiology conference.
35722,Sheldon,who’s nowitzki?
43919,Sheldon,"well, then it looks like we have a winner. congratulations."
43923,Sheldon,kind of a wuss.
43924,Sheldon,still hasn’t bought milk even though i told him two days ago.
43925,Sheldon,what are you doing?
43929,Sheldon,"yep, i’m on it. hey, look at that, an indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
43930,Sheldon,found one.
35743,Sheldon,"dill slices, not sweet?"
43937,Sheldon,"come on, daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist."
35749,Sheldon,vociferously?
43942,Sheldon,we better choose a name no one can make fun of. sir frederick william herschel didn’t do uranus any favours.
35751,Sheldon,"oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?"
43944,Sheldon,koo from koothrappali and per from cooper.
43945,Sheldon,"nah, you’re right, that’s dumb."
43951,Sheldon,"all right, way to go, cat poster. you hang in there."
35762,Sheldon,the photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
43954,Sheldon,exactly. see how well we work together?
43955,Sheldon,good news. you’re an asteroid.
43957,Sheldon,"well, it took a little negotiating, but i wore him down. uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and i have children, they all have to be named rajesh."
43960,Sheldon,"oh, hello, everyone. i am happy to report i’m feeling much better."
35777,Sheldon,"no problem, i’ll just do my laundry another night."
35779,Sheldon,yes?
35781,Sheldon,really? despite the sign that says “do not leave laundry unattended”?
43973,Sheldon,hello.
43974,Sheldon,"physically, yes, but i’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason."
43976,Sheldon,"i had a hundred and one fever. if that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"
43981,Sheldon,"well, now, well, that’s hurtful."
35792,Sheldon," i am very, very sorry for what i have done. here’s your laundry, i rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished."
43984,Sheldon,"well, then raj and i will…"
43985,Sheldon,very well. stuart.
43987,Sheldon,"our friends are jerks, and i’m mad at all of them."
35797,Sheldon,"oh look, saturn 3 is on."
43991,Sheldon,i don’t know. a music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
35804,Sheldon,then i believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock moment.
44002,Sheldon,"well, all right. what if i apologize to all of them?"
35814,Sheldon,so what exactly do you want us to do?
35815,Sheldon,really? they don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
35817,Sheldon,i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion.
35819,Sheldon,snap what?
35820,Sheldon,why wasn’t that plan a?
35821,Sheldon,will you all excuse me? leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
44011,Sheldon,"you brought me my comic books when i wasn’t feeling well. that, that was thoughtful. and i was insensitive. i’m sorry."
44014,Sheldon,"that would be my understanding. on a less painful subject, what size t-shirt do you take?"
35833,Sheldon,see? why don’t i believe you?
44026,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been on a little trip myself recently. not to sin city but to sincere city. where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth."
44029,Sheldon,"before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to emily."
35844,Sheldon,"it’s colloquial, a conversation opener. so, do you find the weather satisfying? are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
44036,Sheldon,are you relieved that you and raj were able to patch things up?
44041,Sheldon,"oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!"
35850,Sheldon,good. what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
35851,Sheldon,"yes, see, of the handful of women leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one i have ever found tolerable."
44046,Sheldon,"uh, for the hundredth time, i smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart."
35855,Sheldon,"yes. now, should that happen, i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
35858,Sheldon,"well, this is very pleasant."
44051,Sheldon,are you comfortable?
35860,Sheldon,"you know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb. a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
35863,Sheldon,good. what’s your favourite fruit?
44055,Sheldon,"oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. i’ll get your room ready."
44064,Sheldon,"well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. you have to like each other. well, we have a 4:30 reservation at applebee’s."
44066,Sheldon,yes.
35875,Sheldon,"it took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. wait here, i’ll find us seats."
35877,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, this is it."
35878,Sheldon,"this is stephanie’s facebook page. now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
44071,Sheldon,thank you. i’m gonna go next door and play with leonard.
35885,Sheldon,i suppose i could spare a few minutes. were you robbed?
35887,Sheldon,"i’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
44082,Sheldon,thank you.
35894,Sheldon,"well, why not?"
44088,Sheldon,i’m nervous. i hope people will be around to watch even though it’s valentine’s day.
35909,Sheldon,like a gladiator!
44101,Sheldon,"and actually, it was three different men."
44103,Sheldon,"all right. nothing about this is fun. no one wants to talk about flags, and i haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, internet. dr. amy farrah flower present with."
44105,Sheldon,"raj, now, i’m sorry you’re suffering. when amy and i were broken up, i also suffered. and this may sound surprising, but i’m grateful for having gone through it."
35917,Sheldon,"i had no choice, he cried in front of her."
35922,Sheldon,is it a high-frequency whistle?
35926,Sheldon,how is it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c? is that imaginary? i don’t think so.
44118,Sheldon,"oh, really? okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
35928,Sheldon,"leonard moves the meeting not occur. is there a second? none heard, the motion fails. i’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with dr. stephanie."
44121,Sheldon,"oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. you know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. i have two doctorates, i still had to go in the sink."
44126,Sheldon,this place is terrific. why. why have we never been here before?
44128,Sheldon,"excuse me. hey, how you doin’?"
35937,Sheldon,see? she’s not offended. and now you finally have an answer.
44134,Sheldon,"nah, she’s a good kid."
35943,Sheldon,like hippies.
44135,Sheldon,of course he’s right. you and i both know how hard it is growing up without a father. that’s why i’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
44138,Sheldon,"a microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? you bet i am."
44145,Sheldon,"please, look at this porcelain skin. i’m like a human sink."
35959,Sheldon,so what? his observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
35968,Sheldon,wait! you bought me a present?
44160,Sheldon,"no. no, if i can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, i suppose i can do this."
44161,Sheldon,"uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. beverly. wil wheaton. adam west, for some reason."
35974,Sheldon,yes?  did you forget your key?
44168,Sheldon,"well, everyone will think i’m weird."
44170,Sheldon,"aw, amy, that was lovely. you know, this is fun. let’s do more. someone else say something wonderful about me."
44174,Sheldon,and it was sheldon cooper who said let’s speed this up. a lot of people want to talk.
35984,Sheldon,"you see, the danger was that i might under or over-reciprocate, but i have devised a foolproof plan. see, i will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
44177,Sheldon,thank you.
44183,Sheldon,i’ve never applied for a patent before. i wanted to make a good impression.
35992,Sheldon,be right back.
35998,Sheldon,"if it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead."
44193,Sheldon,i’m fine with that.
36002,Sheldon,"leonard, i believe it is. this is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. also, i’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
44195,Sheldon,but which one of us should be the party who…
36008,Sheldon,"we don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. we can’t run away from a fight."
44200,Sheldon,"hey, leonard."
44206,Sheldon,"well, i believe i’m treating you generously. that’s why i’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
36017,Sheldon,do it.
44210,Sheldon,"i’ll add it right now. oh, baby, it’s addendum time."
36023,Sheldon,just a toy robot?
44215,Sheldon,and i just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
36025,Sheldon,it is extracted from the plant…
44217,Sheldon,"uh, can you repeat that? you’re breaking up."
44221,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i didn’t get that."
36030,Sheldon,what’d you say of the idea of you and i becoming friends?
44222,Sheldon,the sound is cutting out. i can’t read that. the video is failing.
36032,Sheldon,well i think we’re off to a terrific start.
36036,Sheldon,"yeah, i agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. but, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best i can do."
44230,Sheldon,"oh, oh, the guy. oh, pardon me. i didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4k display and a thunderbolt port?"
36041,Sheldon,"your questionnaire, very disappointing."
44238,Sheldon,but you only have two eyes. you got a lot of nostril hairs.
44239,Sheldon,oh. i am.
36051,Sheldon,"the ice caps are melting leonard. in the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. but you do bring up an interesting point. i don’t have to break new ground here, i’m sure much of the research already exists."
36053,Sheldon,you’re driving me to the mall. i’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
36054,Sheldon,coping with the death of a loved one. my condolences.
36057,Sheldon,excuse me. do you have any books about making friends?
36061,Sheldon,oh i do like monkeys!
44263,Sheldon,i have an old teddy bear i secretly wiped my nose on for years.
36073,Sheldon,"hardly. fear of heights is illogical. fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. what would you say is the minimum altitude i need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
36074,Sheldon,"little kid hominids, perhaps.  is this your entire job? your parents must be so proud."
44265,Sheldon,what good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
44267,Sheldon,i suppose i could try getting rid of the golf ball.
36084,Sheldon,"oh yes, i pass out all the time. but, it was worth it. i’ve made substantial progress in bonding with kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
36086,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. you are safe."
36087,Sheldon,"don’t be silly. howard, you do not have a phd, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays."
44280,Sheldon,"well, how would i know?"
36092,Sheldon,no? but we’re friends!
36093,Sheldon,i’m confused. i was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
44285,Sheldon,"look, i’m sorry, when did you even get here? i…"
36095,Sheldon,the problem appears to be unsolvable.
44290,Sheldon,i’m ready to go.
44292,Sheldon,"well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time."
36103,Sheldon,why?
44299,Sheldon,that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
44305,Sheldon,"well, i’m not proud of it, but i jaywalked."
36114,Sheldon,"my expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. the rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. or her own protection. take some."
44312,Sheldon,"oh, never have i ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
44316,Sheldon,"i have a question about batman. batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. now, if man-bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be man-batman?"
36126,Sheldon,"penny, you appear to have a package here."
44319,Sheldon,"what, why did you get a party sub?"
44322,Sheldon,"hmm? well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. lucky for you it’s tomorrow."
44327,Sheldon,he says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
44329,Sheldon,"of course, it will require a vote. unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, i have my travel gavel."
36143,Sheldon,you don’t remember me? how could he not remember me?
36144,Sheldon,i remember him.
36145,Sheldon,i’ve got it. he didn’t remember me because the last time we met i was in a halloween costume.
44337,Sheldon,"oh, it’s just a meeting. one simple meeting."
36147,Sheldon,"hello, penny."
36150,Sheldon,"well done, leonard. the true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature."
44343,Sheldon,wait. you were pretending?
44345,Sheldon,"hmm, what do you think?"
36155,Sheldon,i have the same problem with him. my theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
44350,Sheldon,"interesting fact, in italian, the morta in mortadella means death."
36163,Sheldon,"you were lucky. when i was a kid, if i wanted an eeg, i had to attach my own electrodes."
44356,Sheldon,"they don’t wear bicycle helmets in game of thrones. you’re thematically inaccurate, but i applaud your commitment to safety."
44358,Sheldon,i never got to ask my question about batman.
44363,Sheldon,"wine again? yeah, no, thank you. i like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box."
36172,Sheldon,can i make you a cup of tea?
44366,Sheldon,"well, it makes perfect sense. because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. i don’t like to. you can’t have sushi. i don’t like to. you can’t go in hot tubs. i consider them vats of sweaty people soup."
44374,Sheldon,"eh, maybe it’s your voice. i’m gonna see if i can get james earl jones to do it in post."
44380,Sheldon,"boy, do i love restrictions."
44383,Sheldon,you’ve heard of french toast?
36194,Sheldon,you’re in my spot.
36195,Sheldon,"no, i’m going to the comic book store."
44392,Sheldon,you’re gonna enjoy this. i designed it especially for you.
36204,Sheldon,why don’t i just eat in my desk chair?
44398,Sheldon,what do you do?
44399,Sheldon,he wants to see i.d.
36210,Sheldon,this is my spot. where else am i supposed to crouch?
36212,Sheldon,all right.
36213,Sheldon,there’s one more zero. you forgot the time parameter.
44408,Sheldon,morning.
36219,Sheldon,"but. oh, this changes everything."
44412,Sheldon,"leonard, friends are like toilet paper. it’s good to have extras under the sink."
36223,Sheldon,"right, just one thing before we start."
44416,Sheldon,khloe?
44420,Sheldon,why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
36235,Sheldon,"oh, i always enjoy that, but i’m a little busy."
44429,Sheldon,"you know the golden rule of line etiquette. no cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
44433,Sheldon,"well, i suppose turnabout is fair play."
44443,Sheldon,i’m back.
44452,Sheldon,"well, no. it’s not cool. if there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. but this line is first-come, first-served. not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. right here."
36261,Sheldon,"you forgot your flash drive, you forgot your flash drive "
44453,Sheldon,you need to go to the back of the line.
36263,Sheldon,are you going to be sarcastic?
44456,Sheldon,"they work for shield, which is a sanctioned department of the u.s. government. do you work for a sanctioned department of the u.s. government?"
36265,Sheldon,the key is hidden in my room.
36268,Sheldon,"oh, i hate when that happens."
36272,Sheldon,"what’s up? i’ll tell you what’s up. i’m in a crisis situation, and i need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…"
36274,Sheldon,"no! leonard, let me tell you something. personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
44466,Sheldon,"yes, i’m inviting people to our wedding. yeah, i’ve already asked stephen hawking and robert downey jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but erno rubik."
44469,Sheldon,"oh, you’re welcome."
36279,Sheldon,put down the letters!
36280,Sheldon,i’m back.
44472,Sheldon,"well, actually, i…"
36283,Sheldon,"no, it’s a novelty i ordered off the internet. now, did you hear the click?"
44476,Sheldon,"i don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great."
44477,Sheldon,isn’t this nice?
44478,Sheldon,dr. hofstadter.
36288,Sheldon,– because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
44481,Sheldon,it only got three-and-a-half stars on yelp.
44485,Sheldon,"if i’d known you were broke, i wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread."
44486,Sheldon,"that’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
36300,Sheldon,but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights?
44492,Sheldon,you realize you and i could become brothers.
36303,Sheldon,i think you’re just making that up.
44498,Sheldon,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
36307,Sheldon,"no, of course you’re not. all right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
44502,Sheldon,"oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately."
36316,Sheldon,good. let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
44510,Sheldon,a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa. you’re kind of a sucker.
36323,Sheldon,"all right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from honoré blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? the assembly line, of course."
36324,Sheldon,"that wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and i do not agree to it now."
44517,Sheldon,"you made god sad today, mom."
36326,Sheldon,i assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. it’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
36329,Sheldon,"it won’t work, the flower’s too porous."
36331,Sheldon,"hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. i’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
36332,Sheldon,"of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. to start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
36336,Sheldon,it’s not my apartment.
44532,Sheldon,that doesn’t sound terrifying.
44533,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i think we are losing sight of the real issue. we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. isn’t that exciting?"
36342,Sheldon,"penny, everything is better with bluetooth."
36343,Sheldon,"oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
36344,Sheldon,we should get to work.
44534,Sheldon,"not at all. in star wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
36350,Sheldon,"thank you. you hear any union talk, you let me know."
36357,Sheldon,"no problem. i’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
36358,Sheldon,"penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
36363,Sheldon,the horror!
44555,Sheldon,"well, now, see? you knew what was gonna happen. why didn’t they? anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me."
36366,Sheldon,you can’t know that. how can you possibly know that?
44562,Sheldon,"the way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing."
36372,Sheldon,so? do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
36375,Sheldon,"if that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
44573,Sheldon,i had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
44574,Sheldon,"ow, it does hurt."
44575,Sheldon,"oh, that was never happening."
36387,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, penny."
36388,Sheldon,"oh, mimicry. i enjoy mimicry. i’ve been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi. “it’s a trap.” you have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “it’s a trap. it’s a trap. it’s a trap.”"
44580,Sheldon,superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
44582,Sheldon,"the first one’s free? flash, how do you stay in business?"
36391,Sheldon,how does one sort of…
36393,Sheldon,"in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo."
36395,Sheldon,"oh, great! now, i have to start all over again. "
44597,Sheldon,with what?
36407,Sheldon,you once had leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
36412,Sheldon,hu-u-u-uh…. hu-u-u-uh!
36414,Sheldon,we don’t have thai food on thursday. we have pizza on thursday.
44606,Sheldon,but what if we can’t?
44616,Sheldon,"not yet. how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment? now, if this experiment is going to be valid, i suggest a neutral environment."
36425,Sheldon,"oh, i forgot sensational spider-man."
36426,Sheldon,a superb choice.
36427,Sheldon,"yeah, provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the dc multiverse."
36433,Sheldon,"no, you!"
44628,Sheldon,how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
44629,Sheldon,you truly are the goofus to my gallant.
36439,Sheldon,are you ill?
36440,Sheldon,all right. then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening?
44635,Sheldon,i know. they probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
44636,Sheldon,enjoy having the place to yourselves.
36445,Sheldon,my original point.
36446,Sheldon,"chinese food, vintage video games. after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday, this is friday night the way it was meant to be."
36449,Sheldon,what are you doing?
36450,Sheldon,isn’t it a little late for coffee?
36451,Sheldon,"well, i’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the dc comics batman chatroom, and i need your help."
44641,Sheldon,"leonard, please, let me go."
44645,Sheldon,"no, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. you know? i know that i have a tendency to be controlling, so i would rather you choose."
44646,Sheldon,"well, clearly, it’s not whatever i want, because what i want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
44648,Sheldon,"fine. okay. now, on this side, i am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
36458,Sheldon,i am forgetting nothing and i resent your tone.
44652,Sheldon,i suppose that works.
36461,Sheldon,"darn tootin’, i win."
44656,Sheldon,"well, it’s funny you should ask, because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
36466,Sheldon,"i believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
36473,Sheldon,and how are you doing this fine evening?
44665,Sheldon,"wow. i anticipated we’d have problems, but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
44666,Sheldon,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
36477,Sheldon,"that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. not only is it indian cuisine, which koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. and finally, it’s main ingredient is paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
44670,Sheldon,"for science, maybe you should."
36480,Sheldon,we have a bowl. our keys go in a bowl. you should get a bowl.
44677,Sheldon,well i’m open to that.
44678,Sheldon,i think we should see other people.
36487,Sheldon,"sure, why not? and after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘cause today’s the day to stop making sense."
36488,Sheldon,"so, how was your day?"
44680,Sheldon,"don’t blame me. blame your pal, biology. he’s the pervert pulling the strings here."
44682,Sheldon,yes.
36492,Sheldon,how can one person be a whole movie?
44689,Sheldon,"if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
36498,Sheldon,can you?
36499,Sheldon,are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
36500,Sheldon,is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
44693,Sheldon,"hmm? well, she spends her whole day scooping. one arm’s probably bigger than the other."
36502,Sheldon,"thank you, that’s very helpful."
36507,Sheldon,alright. goodnight.
36509,Sheldon,i can’t sleep. how are you going?
44705,Sheldon,"i’m sure you’re right. i suppose i should apologize to you, as well."
44708,Sheldon,"i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. it, it was unnecessary. this is warm. oh, and also, i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
44709,Sheldon,"amy, you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women. and to prove how serious i am about us, i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level. "
36518,Sheldon,thank you for letting me stay here.
44715,Sheldon,"oh, uh, stuart, bert from the geology lab, and mrs. petrescu from downstairs."
36525,Sheldon,"excuse me, spoiler alert."
36527,Sheldon,said the grinch to christmas.
44721,Sheldon,"the average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. if that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
36533,Sheldon,"answer the phone, leonard."
36534,Sheldon,aren’t you going to check your messages?
44734,Sheldon,"all right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
36543,Sheldon,"all right, what if we use this two-inch pvc to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
36544,Sheldon,"you don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?"
44738,Sheldon,"no, i mean it. i mean it. it’s like you have the soul of a label maker."
44741,Sheldon,"you know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em."
36556,Sheldon,i can’t comment without violating our agreement that i don’t criticize your work.
36569,Sheldon,"of course not. i’m a theoretical physicist, a career i chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if i’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, i will be the scientist to confirm string theory. people will write books about me. third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
36572,Sheldon,"i’m not good with cold, leonard. how often have we had to leave a movie theatre because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast? i can’t go."
36573,Sheldon,how can you say that? the scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
44768,Sheldon,"no, no, he’s over there."
36581,Sheldon,yes.
36583,Sheldon,"well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. now, i know i’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?"
36584,Sheldon,"well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
36585,Sheldon,"excellent. and just an fyi, as i am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. but don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
36588,Sheldon, penny.
36589,Sheldon, penny.
44784,Sheldon,"wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room."
44793,Sheldon,but what if we move and we don’t like it? what if there’s a smoker in the building? or pets? or there could be mould? there could be traffic noise. i’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. are you trying to soothe me by singing the star trek theme as a lullaby?
36603,Sheldon,two for two. i’m on fire.
36605,Sheldon,"alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the arctic circle."
44810,Sheldon,"huh. yeah, i wonder if that’s related to the 12th century persian philosopher, al-ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
36621,Sheldon,what is it?
44816,Sheldon,"oh, jiminy, that’s cold."
44817,Sheldon,"all right, just warn me before you do it."
36628,Sheldon,it is remarkable.
44821,Sheldon,did it work? are they brain cells yet?
44825,Sheldon,"what stimulus should we introduce it to first? light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s"
36641,Sheldon,"you fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
44835,Sheldon,"yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
36644,Sheldon,so we slept together naked. it was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
36647,Sheldon,did leonard know about this? leonard’s my best friend in the world. surely leonard didn’t know.
44843,Sheldon,"well, hello."
36656,Sheldon,"yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and i’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that i have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
44849,Sheldon,"amy, i didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. the flamenco."
36663,Sheldon,"and on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
44858,Sheldon,"who leaves their bike in the hallway? you know, if i knew how to ride one, i’d steal it."
36668,Sheldon,"all right, i’ve had enough. attention, everyone. i’ m dr. sheldon cooper. as many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
36681,Sheldon,that was different. they were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
44873,Sheldon,i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
36685,Sheldon,"howard, you know me to be a very smart man. don’t you think if i were wrong, i’d know it?"
44877,Sheldon,"thank you, penny. you know, i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure."
44878,Sheldon,and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
36689,Sheldon,"oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
36690,Sheldon,"excuse me, wolverine: origin. miniseries issue two, page 22. retractable bone claws. if you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
36691,Sheldon,tandoori palace?
44884,Sheldon,"well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
44886,Sheldon,"you know, i’m not sure. you know, you’d have to ask him. excuse me.  aah. leonard, i hurt myself again."
36698,Sheldon,"hang on. based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
36699,Sheldon,"in 1890, emile dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. a precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
36702,Sheldon,that is a snowy tree cricket. oecanthus fultoni. i was done with latin by fifth grade.
36703,Sheldon,i can’t take your money.
36705,Sheldon,thank god.
36706,Sheldon,fair enough. what stake do you propose?
44898,Sheldon,"yes, that’s right. i have amy. in the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. does it eat you up inside that i have her and you don’t?"
44899,Sheldon,"i didn’t punch him. he turned around, and i gave him a captain kirk karate chop. i’m not even sure he knows i did it."
44908,Sheldon,"you know, i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
44910,Sheldon,it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny.
44911,Sheldon,"yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
36720,Sheldon,"forgive me. yiddish was not spoken in east texas. and if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
44912,Sheldon,"look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting."
36722,Sheldon,"he’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is jiminy.  "
36723,Sheldon,interesting. you’re afraid of insects and women. ladybugs must render you catatonic. it was a joke. i made it to lessen your discomfort. you’re welcome
44915,Sheldon,"you know, leonard, the more i think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through. uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, longclaw?"
36725,Sheldon,i’m dr. cooper from the physics department.
36726,Sheldon,i’m sorry?
44916,Sheldon,"that seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
36728,Sheldon,told you.
36729,Sheldon,"no, no, wait. dr. crawley, are you sure?"
36732,Sheldon,old comic book. i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
44929,Sheldon,"it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing, i skipped kindergarten."
44930,Sheldon,"yeah, take whatever you want."
44937,Sheldon,"all right, i tried. that should be the title of your autobiography. ooh, a second-degree burn."
36746,Sheldon,have i crossed some sort of line again?
36749,Sheldon,"penny, while i subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of sheldons in an infinite number of universes, i assure you that in none of them am i dancing."
36752,Sheldon,"dear lord, are you still going to be here on french toast day?"
44945,Sheldon,and now you know as much about him as i do.
36758,Sheldon,"i’m sure that will happen soon enough. but in the meantime, i still want oatmeal."
44951,Sheldon,"in fact, i want you to keep the apartment flag, and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
44954,Sheldon,it’s midnight. happy birthday.
44957,Sheldon,and it’s not just an mri. the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you.
44960,Sheldon,"yeah. i’m afraid so. childbirth, looming coitus? this is a banner night for female genitals."
44965,Sheldon,grape. i find it the most mild.
44966,Sheldon,"well, i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
36778,Sheldon,"i’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. i thought the “bazinga” was implied. i’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
44970,Sheldon,"oh, i know, but just, leonard and penny think we’re doing it, and i don’t want to disappoint them."
44972,Sheldon,intriguing. is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
44978,Sheldon,"what, a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff? how scandalous. you naughty girl, you went to the wizarding world theme park without me."
44980,Sheldon,you know i’ve been wanting to go.
36791,Sheldon,this movie baffles me every time we watch it.
44983,Sheldon,"she’s right. you know, i just learned amy went to a theme park without me, but i’m not going to ruin her birthday. i’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. boop."
36794,Sheldon,"although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
36797,Sheldon,you guess? you don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
36798,Sheldon,"i believe it means that the u.s. government is going to expel him from the country. he could then either return to his native india, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. personally, i’d choose pirate."
44999,Sheldon,"eh, i don’t know. i am her precious little boy. and you did take my flower."
45000,Sheldon,anyway…
36809,Sheldon,"that’s happy, right?"
36816,Sheldon,of course i’m busy.
36818,Sheldon,for me.
45011,Sheldon,just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought i was.
45013,Sheldon,and?
36822,Sheldon,please.
45014,Sheldon,can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
45017,Sheldon,"i was going chronologically. you’re right between koothrappali’s father and omar, the one-eyed sparkletts guy."
36827,Sheldon,i’m the boss. i make the jokes.
45019,Sheldon,"disagree. we’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in noah and his amazing zoo boat. this could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me."
45023,Sheldon,i have gotten much better at that.
36838,Sheldon,"all right! first of all, dr. koothrappali, when i first proposed that you work with me…"
36840,Sheldon,"oh! if i’m wrong, prove it."
45032,Sheldon,"so bernadette, if i express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
36843,Sheldon,give me the eraser.
36845,Sheldon,"fine.  oh, lord. dr. koothrappali, as your superior, i forbid you from writing on my board!"
45038,Sheldon,"thank you, internet. i’m telling you, with the right youtube video, i can give howard a vasectomy."
36849,Sheldon,i looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
45041,Sheldon,i’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
45043,Sheldon,only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
36855,Sheldon,i walked.
36859,Sheldon,"from your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
45051,Sheldon,"leonard, she might be drunk. all she had was chips."
45054,Sheldon,you know what? i feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
45056,Sheldon,bye.
36865,Sheldon,"i’d imagine you heard any number of things today. when you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, raj, how are you, raj? given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? and possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
45057,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ll miss you too."
36869,Sheldon,how does it different from the money i have?
45063,Sheldon,"good lord, i made you tea, just drink it."
36872,Sheldon,thank you. you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
45066,Sheldon,"wow, and i remember when you loved playing games with me. maybe penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
36878,Sheldon,"my arduous journey, however, was for naught. although advertised to appear, he did not show up. it was at that moment, i vowed eternal hatred for wil wheaton."
36882,Sheldon,my enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. game.
45075,Sheldon,there’s a cucumber in my water.
45078,Sheldon,"oh good, you’re here. are you still fighting? if you get divorced, do i get two christmas’s?"
45082,Sheldon,"oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting leonard in as is condition."
36892,Sheldon,brimstone.
45086,Sheldon,"of course you’re fine. not every member of a species finds a mate. sir isaac newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
36895,Sheldon,"you betrayed me, wil wheaton. now i have my revenge."
36902,Sheldon,"excuse me. you’re misusing the word ho. it’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, land, ho! or, uh, westward, ho!"
45095,Sheldon,"well, i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
36907,Sheldon,"focus, leonard, focus! the heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
45100,Sheldon,"it could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them."
36910,Sheldon,victory!
45103,Sheldon,wonderful. although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig.
36913,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. and without rules, the competition has no meaning. and without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  i have your kite. i have your kite."
45106,Sheldon,you are happy?
36918,Sheldon,football or chicken-fried meats?
36923,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah. all right, poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
45116,Sheldon,yes.
45117,Sheldon,it’s like you’re twins.
45120,Sheldon,you first.
45123,Sheldon,gladly. can we storm out?
45125,Sheldon,not really.
45127,Sheldon,"it’s more than that. it’s me. i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
45128,Sheldon,"i thought i was getting better at it, but clearly i’m not."
45129,Sheldon,"yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. you’re kind of a sad sack. i’m sorry, i shouldn’t have said that. i’m just upset."
36938,Sheldon,"i’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. let me try again. have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
36939,Sheldon,"good. oh, fyi. after i eat my sandwich, i’m taking koothrappali’s patang kite out for a test run. would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
45131,Sheldon,yes?
36949,Sheldon,i’ll just roll for you.
45142,Sheldon,"shame on you. where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? i’ll tell you. we would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics."
36953,Sheldon,has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
36959,Sheldon,leonard! stop the car!
36963,Sheldon,"go, go, power rangers, go!"
45158,Sheldon,"well, i would love to help you, but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, i don’t think i can go back to theory. i’m an engineer now. and, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. not that goofy kind you are."
36968,Sheldon,"stop it, both of you. all this fighting, i might as well be back with my parents! damn it, george, i told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ i’d leave you! well, i guess that makes you a liar, ’cause i’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! stop yelling! you’re making sheldon cry! i’ll tell you what’s making sheldon cry! that i let you name him sheldon."
45163,Sheldon,"oh. well, i guess it’s fixed."
36973,Sheldon,"excuse me, miss. i’d like to order lunch."
45168,Sheldon,"oh, what choice do i have? you need me. i’m like the crankshaft of this team."
36978,Sheldon,aren’t you going to ask me if i want a beverage?
45171,Sheldon,i’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.
36981,Sheldon,"yes, i want you to apologize to leonard."
36984,Sheldon,"all right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, leonard is wrong."
36987,Sheldon,"your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
45179,Sheldon,it’s slowing down.
36993,Sheldon,right now would be good.
36994,Sheldon,"although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
45185,Sheldon,hello.
45188,Sheldon,"msn search, altavista, and ask jeeves. you?"
36997,Sheldon,"i’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know i’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a richard feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her franklin mint collectible plates."
45190,Sheldon,not at all. amy?
45191,Sheldon,"well, i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
37000,Sheldon,"can i get this comic book, too?"
37001,Sheldon,i should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
45194,Sheldon,"although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. oh, he looks sad again."
45195,Sheldon,"no. no, i only told leonard, howard, raj, kripke, uh, professor wu, professor klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. how everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
37005,Sheldon,penny?
45197,Sheldon,"oh. well, now i’m sorry i asked."
37012,Sheldon,they’re holding umbrellas.
37013,Sheldon,the ducks in my tub.
45209,Sheldon,that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone.
37021,Sheldon,i see no organizational system in here whatsoever. which panties do you wear on mondays?
37024,Sheldon,"okay, here."
45217,Sheldon,"thank you, bert. you’re a good man. that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
37026,Sheldon,we should have you checked for a concussion.
45218,Sheldon,"oh. oh, i’m sorry. correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – that better?"
37028,Sheldon,don’t look?
37029,Sheldon,"oh. well, that’s understandable. you may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. uh, lot and his wife, perseus and medusa, orpheus and eurydice."
45219,Sheldon,"all right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call bert."
45229,Sheldon,he sounds like a sociopath.
45230,Sheldon,you’re talking about me. very funny. although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
45233,Sheldon,she’s gonna hate the panels.
37044,Sheldon,"oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. nailed it. while we have a moment, may i ask you a question?"
45241,Sheldon,"i’m always honest with amy. the other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and i said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. when there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
45242,Sheldon,"i should hope so. when she called me an insensitive jerk, i’d like to think she meant it."
37051,Sheldon,kidney disease?
45246,Sheldon,"so they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? that’s hilarious. i can’t wait to tell them."
37059,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. there, there. everything’s going to be fine. sheldon’s here."
45257,Sheldon,"i’m a big boy, and if i missed one, i’d throw a big-boy tantrum."
37066,Sheldon,"thank you, kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
37069,Sheldon,"yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. it’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
45263,Sheldon,"well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. it’s a list of this year’s panelists. it’s long, isn’t it?"
37072,Sheldon,yes. look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
45265,Sheldon,wow. i’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
45267,Sheldon,roofing.
37076,Sheldon,"now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
37078,Sheldon,"of course. first, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  a north and south pole. if you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
37088,Sheldon,it’s a simple matter. there are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
37090,Sheldon,"all right, how’s this for revenge? a solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
37093,Sheldon,"already taken care of. observe. this is a live shot of kripke’s lab via a mini webcam i was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. at the same time, i also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
37094,Sheldon,"you flatter me, sir."
45285,Sheldon,"well, i know this is a difficult time for you. you’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
37096,Sheldon,"it may be low-tech, but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
37099,Sheldon,"leonard, she’s doing it again."
37100,Sheldon,no. it upsets sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. this is essentially why you have famine in india.
37104,Sheldon,"don’t sheldon me. we ordered for five people, not six."
45298,Sheldon,"hey, raj, i owe you an apology. look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
37107,Sheldon,my mother was right. hell is real.
37110,Sheldon,your shoes are delightful. where did you get them?
45303,Sheldon,i can’t sleep.
37112,Sheldon,that’s not fair. i got stuck behind a tree.
37113,Sheldon,just need a little more practice.
45307,Sheldon,that is true. did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
37116,Sheldon,"all right.  go away. i agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy."
45308,Sheldon,"penny would be the entree. then leonard’s basically a cheese course. and because i love you, you’re dessert."
45313,Sheldon,so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
37124,Sheldon,"interesting. i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla, i could teach you some rudimentary physics."
45320,Sheldon,it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee. it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
37129,Sheldon,how are you going to take notes without a notebook?
45322,Sheldon,that is a valid point. perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
45323,Sheldon,"all right, let’s start right now. uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
45324,Sheldon,is it?
37138,Sheldon,"now, remember, newton realized that aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. so let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as a and we get force, earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. so we can see that ma equals mg and what do we know from this?"
45330,Sheldon,fire away.
45333,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, go ahead."
37142,Sheldon,i’m sorry.  have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
45334,Sheldon,"ooh, that sounds fun. now, we’re talking about real treats, right? not bible verses like my mother used to give me."
45336,Sheldon,"yes, this is remarkable."
45340,Sheldon,"all right, either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races."
37149,Sheldon,no.
37153,Sheldon,all right. leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
45345,Sheldon,that is a daring and insightful solution. 
37159,Sheldon,"no, on the contrary. i found the grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and i was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved christmas. what a buzz kill that was."
45357,Sheldon,"i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. and for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom."
45358,Sheldon,"well, i’m not needed at both places at the same time. and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
37172,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, i believe the word is om."
45366,Sheldon,it’s five and a half.
37175,Sheldon,august 16th. right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
45372,Sheldon,"well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
45373,Sheldon,"hmm? oh, i did. it hasn’t stopped. i figured out a solution for our navigation system while i was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
45376,Sheldon,that didn’t happen.
45378,Sheldon,"i am fine. here, eat your toast.  sorry."
37190,Sheldon,what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule known as sheldon alpha five.
45384,Sheldon,nine o’clock? what happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
37195,Sheldon,"if it’s any consolation, i’m not happy about it either. good night."
45392,Sheldon,that’s it. i’m in breach of my security clearance. i’m going to prison. and you know what happens to people like me in prison. i’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
45393,Sheldon,i’m trying.
37205,Sheldon,"all right. well, i’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
37206,Sheldon,"well, i understand there are several types of artificial women. maybe you should look into that."
45398,Sheldon,it’s hard to say.
37208,Sheldon,the zoot suit riots.
45399,Sheldon,it’s getting clearer.
37210,Sheldon,that’s a semantically null sentence.
45402,Sheldon,"it’s called fitting in. by the way, good luck."
37212,Sheldon,"if outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
45408,Sheldon,thank you for making me tea.
37217,Sheldon,"well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in flatland. oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
45410,Sheldon,you know exactly what i need.
37221,Sheldon,i don’t drink.
45419,Sheldon,"sure you do. i was telling you both the story about how haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. it was at the summer olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…"
45422,Sheldon,"and now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments. "
37233,Sheldon,i thought your father was a gynaecologist. i’m sorry. 
37236,Sheldon,thank you. have you chosen one to copulate with?
37248,Sheldon,"good night, puny human! ."
45451,Sheldon,hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper.
45454,Sheldon,"okay, one second."
37263,Sheldon,"right, games. they took halo 1, halo 2, halo 3, call of duty 1, call of duty 2, call of duty 3, rock band, rock band 2, final fantasy 1 thru 9, the legend of zelda, the legend of zelda: ocarina of time, the legend of zelda: twilight princess, super mario brothers, super mario galaxy, mario and sonic at the winter olympics and ms. pacman."
45456,Sheldon,what happened to me? i used to excel at these things.
37266,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard. it’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
37274,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
45466,Sheldon,"well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. you need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
37277,Sheldon,"all right, then. good night."
37278,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
37281,Sheldon,i see you’re drinking wine.
45473,Sheldon,you’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
45476,Sheldon,"okay, i think i got that."
45477,Sheldon,"okay. just to be on the safe side, am i in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?"
37287,Sheldon,all right. i’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
37291,Sheldon,what if they cut the power?
37292,Sheldon,what if someone steals my keys?
45486,Sheldon,"oh, i stopped that, it was dumb. uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
45489,Sheldon,this conversation is over.
45498,Sheldon,"thank you. no bendy straw, some party."
37307,Sheldon,"oh, if that were only true. unfortunately, as i’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, i need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena. like enid, oklahoma. low crime rate and high-speed internet connectivity, but no model train shops. sorry, enid."
45501,Sheldon,"i hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer."
37310,Sheldon,"i sense you’re making a joke, but bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin, so do not forward my mail there."
45502,Sheldon,who else has access to this room?
37312,Sheldon,they should. it’s one of the first things i plan to bring up upon arrival.
37314,Sheldon,"that is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. lord, is it cold!"
37316,Sheldon,interesting. the acquaintance is the first to greet me.
45509,Sheldon,"i feel so betrayed. you know, all my life i thought uncle sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. turns out he’s the other kind."
37318,Sheldon,is it morning?
37323,Sheldon,"you’re right.  it’s a great idea, leonard. thank you."
45516,Sheldon,"well, i thought that, too, but i’ve come to realize, i am completely dependent on you."
37325,Sheldon,unit cell contains two carbon atoms. interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
37327,Sheldon,"pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
37337,Sheldon,impaired cognitive function.
37341,Sheldon,"back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. child’s play. you can start sorting protons and neutrons while i build carbon atoms."
45533,Sheldon,"the salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
45534,Sheldon,"well, i’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. besides, princeton is in new jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. uh, i know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…"
37344,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
45540,Sheldon,"hmm, yes. yeah, perhaps i’ve been harder on them than they deserve."
37349,Sheldon,i came to tell you i’ve got the answer.
37359,Sheldon,"i do. for thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. do you have anything like that?"
37360,Sheldon,shouldn’t you check your database?
45553,Sheldon,"well, i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered, i’ll tell you that."
37362,Sheldon,"oh, that would be good! sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and i sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
37363,Sheldon,i could do that.
45555,Sheldon,i’m sorry you had to go through that.
37365,Sheldon,what’s sheetrock?
37369,Sheldon,i’m trying to get these tables cleared. we’re slammed.
45562,Sheldon,let’s sit somewhere else.
37378,Sheldon,yep.
45571,Sheldon,"hey, everybody. this is my friend, dr. nowitzki."
37384,Sheldon,"professor norton, although, god knows why. he hasn’t published anything of note since he won that nobel prize."
37385,Sheldon,in switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
37393,Sheldon,"not so fast. you might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, penny."
37394,Sheldon,"rabeliechtli. it means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals. which you will not be celebrating because, a, these festivals occur in the fall, and b, you will not be going to switzerland."
37395,Sheldon,afraid not. do you recognize this?
37401,Sheldon,very well.
37402,Sheldon,"all right. this game is called traitors. i will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. benedict arnold, judas, dr. leonard hofstadter."
37405,Sheldon,"he owns fox, and they cancelled firefly. hint, he and darth vader are tied for number 2."
45600,Sheldon,i think dr. nowitzki is a friendly colleague. i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
37409,Sheldon,it’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. i’ve had some time to reflect and i’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. it’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. butterscotch scone?
37410,Sheldon,"what you’re tasting is respect and affection. and about a pound of crisco. after you’ve finished breakfast, i thought we could spend the day watching the final season of babylon 5 with director commentary."
45609,Sheldon,mommy.
45612,Sheldon,okay.
37422,Sheldon,"oh, good. bye-bye."
45618,Sheldon,leonard! leonard i’m sick!
37427,Sheldon,"howard, could you lower the lights? i have a short powerpoint presentation."
45626,Sheldon,gentlemen.
45627,Sheldon,the brady bunch? 
45630,Sheldon,none shall pass. 
37442,Sheldon,i’ve decided i’m going to have mr. lee sign my copy of this month’s batman.
37445,Sheldon,there’s neosporin and band-aids in my top desk drawer.
37450,Sheldon,it bothers me.
45642,Sheldon,sit over there. baby wipe?
45644,Sheldon,hmmmm?
37456,Sheldon,so you betrayed me?
45652,Sheldon,tell me what you see here.
45654,Sheldon,"oh my! that’s awfully sticky. alright, let’s see. bernie bunny has two daddies now. it’s probably about homosexual rabbits. jerry the gerbil and the bullies on the bus. read it, not helpful. oh! here we go. stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo. author sarah carpenter lives in fort wayne, indiana, with her husband and best friend mark, and their cockatoos too. hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?"
45660,Sheldon,"zoom, zoom, zoom! where’s the coffee?"
37470,Sheldon,"i’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. so shall we rehearse?"
37474,Sheldon,"there’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
37487,Sheldon,that’s the toilet?
45679,Sheldon,it’s you! i touched you!
37489,Sheldon,you know very well how it went.
37490,Sheldon,i was found guilty and fined $533.
45686,Sheldon,"don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know i’ll do it!"
37495,Sheldon,"no, no. i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to have gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime. the moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
45689,Sheldon,"ez aquarii b, ez aquarii c, excuse me, madam."
45690,Sheldon,junior mints.
45696,Sheldon,you said to do whatever feels natural. this feels natural. certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
37509,Sheldon,it’s not elvish. it’s the language of mordor written in elvish script. one ring to
37513,Sheldon,"other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
45705,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, good. there you are. i need you to check my head for chair lice."
37515,Sheldon,you mean my ring?
37524,Sheldon,i would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. i have endless patience. i once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with hewlett-packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
37526,Sheldon,"go ahead. i have no illusions about my mother. she is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild dr. pepper addiction. anything you’d like to add?"
45720,Sheldon,"oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
37530,Sheldon,stop it!
45725,Sheldon,this is dr. sheldon cooper. experimental log. wormhole generator test forty-four.
45727,Sheldon,i found your webcam and replaced the video feed. you two should be ashamed of yourselves.
45730,Sheldon,"amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?"
45741,Sheldon,"we’re fine, thank you."
37559,Sheldon,"i don’t know. if you’re my x-men, what are your powers?"
45755,Sheldon,thank goodness i got it. now i can quit checking my stool.
45760,Sheldon,"it’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
45763,Sheldon,"knock, knock, knock, penny? knock, knock, knock, penny? knock, knock, knock, penny?"
37572,Sheldon,i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
37574,Sheldon,suppose i could run downtown and pick up something at shel-mart.
37575,Sheldon,"you know, the nice thing about shel-mart is i own it, so i get a 15% discount."
45766,Sheldon,"buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. you got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. i have an eidetic memory. sometimes it’s a curse."
45767,Sheldon,"hello, amy. it’s sheldon. yeah, i, i know that we’re broken up, but i’m leaving this message because i thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about mr. spock. or as i like to call it, a spockumentary. yeah, i’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. you know, hysterically, hmm? and with a tinge of sadness that i’m no longer in your life."
45769,Sheldon,who lives in a pineapple. nope.
37581,Sheldon,it’s only one colour.
37582,Sheldon,that’s a lot of money for only one colour.
37586,Sheldon,okay. but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  this is absurd. i look like a clown.
37590,Sheldon,i was wearing size a million pants.
45785,Sheldon,"thank you. that’s what i was going for. now, leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. for your convenience, i disassemble into four pieces."
45786,Sheldon,"you don’t know where i am. my physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location."
45787,Sheldon,"no, i’m not."
45790,Sheldon,it’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
37600,Sheldon,i can’t do this. i’m going to faint.
45795,Sheldon,perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
37605,Sheldon,"penny, leonard. would you be able to answer some questions i’m having about the events of last night?"
37609,Sheldon,"you are ignoring the square-cube law. the giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. and for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, batmobile, and then giant ant."
37610,Sheldon,perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
45804,Sheldon,closer to the microphone.
45807,Sheldon,and i’m safe and sound in bed. who’s crazy now?
37617,Sheldon,that is what is referred to as a burn on you.
37618,Sheldon,"good, penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
37620,Sheldon,sarcasm?
45816,Sheldon,i must speak to him.
45817,Sheldon,"excuse me, mr. wozniak?"
37629,Sheldon,"oh, foolish wil wheaton, it was never off."
37633,Sheldon,"i’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip cathy. when she’s upset, she says ach and eats ice cream."
37634,Sheldon,"if you were a cat, i would have brought you a lasagna."
37637,Sheldon,and let me tell you sleep did not come easily with leonard in the next room singing along with alanis morrisette.
37645,Sheldon,"attention, all bowlers. i’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
37646,Sheldon,"no, not the wesley crushers. the wesley “crushers.”"
37650,Sheldon,"no, it’s not the… never mind."
37652,Sheldon,"oh, yes? well, before i respond, let me ask you a question. is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
37662,Sheldon,he’s evil. he plays evil mind games. did he tell you his grandmother died?
37664,Sheldon,"enjoy the accolades now, wil wheaton, but like your time on star trek: next generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
37667,Sheldon,"are you insane? if she leaves, it’s over!"
37673,Sheldon,"i think you mean telekinetically. and no, i just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and leonard are no longer having coitus."
37676,Sheldon,"oh, yes. it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. i’d hate for that effort to have been in vain."
37677,Sheldon,just to be clear do i have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
37678,Sheldon,"harsh terms. but all right, i’ll just substitute intercourse."
37680,Sheldon,"well, my existence is a continuum, so i’ve been what i am at each point in the implied time period."
37689,Sheldon,is he making any progress? because i’d like to erase ben affleck as daredevil.
37698,Sheldon,"i read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. bye-bye."
37704,Sheldon,i didn’t say outside.
37706,Sheldon,which way are you going?
37710,Sheldon,i shall. have a nice scoot.
29523,Sheldon,"i am a mobile virtual presence device. recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. until such time as i am able to transfer my consciousness, i shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner."
37722,Sheldon,i do. leonard never cooks for me.
37724,Sheldon,"oh, lord, i’m in jewish hell."
37726,Sheldon,i got lost.
37727,Sheldon,satellites are down. solar flares.
37729,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i misspoke. what i meant to say was my battery died.
37735,Sheldon,point taken. you may want to sit up.
37737,Sheldon,"we had dinner last night. she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. well, little hot dog. i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. a real, big dog. a hell hound. tangential to the primary story. how about i circle back to it?"
37744,Sheldon,we stayed for the california adventure water show. it was pure disney magic.
37750,Sheldon,explain your sneeze.
37764,Sheldon,yes. bazinga. leonard?
37766,Sheldon,"when i’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. you know the drill. all right, if you’ll excuse me, i am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
37773,Sheldon,"shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends brad and angelina."
37782,Sheldon,you’re just misappropriating my understanding.
37790,Sheldon,good. i’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. i’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. you’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. it’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
37792,Sheldon,"oh, let me just get one thing. it’s my backup emergency supply kit. the living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. now, good night. and if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
37794,Sheldon,morning.
37796,Sheldon,"excuse me, i’m going to relieve myself."
37803,Sheldon,"that’s preposterous. tell her, leonard."
37811,Sheldon,"and of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to dr. hofstadter."
37818,Sheldon,there’s doubt?
37819,Sheldon,"that’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that i was right."
37827,Sheldon,how on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
37828,Sheldon,not my world.
37830,Sheldon,i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
37832,Sheldon,hello.
37836,Sheldon,well it’s not a great question. how could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? that’s a great question.
37839,Sheldon,he must be very skilled at coitus.
37844,Sheldon,oh! not this again.
37850,Sheldon,counting this instance? 317.
37851,Sheldon,she returned to her apartment. i presume to shower and vomit. not necessarily in that order.
37854,Sheldon,who’s going to tell whom about what?
37863,Sheldon,he didn’t date. it was pon farr. his blood boiled with mating lust.
37865,Sheldon,"as i will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. but for the record, i only drink hot chocolate in months with an r in them."
37868,Sheldon,curse you.
37875,Sheldon,"impressive, but we must be cautious."
37878,Sheldon,"you realize, penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
37898,Sheldon,i know. i can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
37901,Sheldon,wait. you have to drive me.
37902,Sheldon,you know i don’t drive.
37903,Sheldon,"i did. he said, and i quote, ask penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
37914,Sheldon,"then, this is my first date."
37915,Sheldon,"i have a master’s degree and two doctorates. the things i should know, i do know."
37917,Sheldon,don’t bother. i’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
37924,Sheldon,thank you.
37926,Sheldon,your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
37930,Sheldon,although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
37936,Sheldon,"i’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, penny. in any event, now that amy and i have spent quality time together, i feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
37942,Sheldon,i’ve decided not to procreate.
37954,Sheldon,"you don’t get it, leonard. i’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
37958,Sheldon,"no, thank you. i’m not eating pizza tonight."
37959,Sheldon,"not for me. thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night. tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
37962,Sheldon,correct.
37965,Sheldon,"certainly. i’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent p.e. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
37992,Sheldon,"no, you’re not. pay no attention to that man in the bed."
37995,Sheldon,"until i can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
38000,Sheldon,uganda.
38002,Sheldon,"in a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does scott joplin play the maple leaf rag?"
38004,Sheldon,you’re right. my apologies.
38005,Sheldon,it’s a game we invented. it’s called counterfactuals.
38014,Sheldon,"a juvenile amalgamation of our names. sheldon and amy,  shamy."
38015,Sheldon,"i should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
38019,Sheldon,"although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. it’s an action we both regret to this day."
38023,Sheldon,are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy?
38029,Sheldon,are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarke-maxwell or dirac?
38039,Sheldon,regarding what?
38045,Sheldon,"now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
38053,Sheldon,it wasn’t a breakup. a breakup would imply that amy was my girlfriend.
38055,Sheldon,i was there. she dumped you.
38065,Sheldon,"well, rest assured, i am in full possession of my faculties."
38067,Sheldon,"yes, ma’am."
38080,Sheldon,"oh, penny? penny?"
38092,Sheldon,"well, you really want to dot the i’s and cross the t’s, don’t you?"
38096,Sheldon,this isn’t a desk. this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity.
38098,Sheldon,brobdingnagian.
38103,Sheldon,yes.
38105,Sheldon,"all right, if you’re not going to remove it, i’ll remove it for you."
38119,Sheldon,it’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
38129,Sheldon,"is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
38130,Sheldon,"you know, when my grandfather died, and meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. it’s very nice. they discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
38132,Sheldon,"meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
38135,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no!"
38139,Sheldon,"are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?"
38145,Sheldon,i did.
38146,Sheldon,"wise decision. you see, amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. leonard has none of these attributes, right, leonard?"
38148,Sheldon,he does it all the time. he’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
38150,Sheldon,"well, i have to void my bladder. it was nice spending this time with you."
38154,Sheldon,amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
38159,Sheldon,"simple! you want a girlfriend, amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. take her off my hands. i give you my blessing."
38161,Sheldon,wait! what am i supposed to do?
38164,Sheldon,amy’s right. he is tedious.
38170,Sheldon,"oh, no worries, i explained my predicament to our letter carrier. he was sympathetic. his exact words were, got your back, jack. bitches be crazy."
38171,Sheldon,darn! she found me!
38175,Sheldon,way to go on the details.
38176,Sheldon,rats!
38177,Sheldon,"no misunderstanding. i’ve learned what that request actually means, and i don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
38183,Sheldon,i assure you i am quite real and i’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
21805,Sheldon,no! that’s where i sit!
21806,Sheldon,"this seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. it also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. as a result, i’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
38191,Sheldon,"why would i touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs."
38196,Sheldon,he rejected train day.
21814,Sheldon,"last question. in a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
21819,Sheldon,i can’t give you eight. i can give you seven thirty.
21821,Sheldon,"no, this is my room. people don’t go in my room."
38208,Sheldon,"hold on. i have to figure out how to get the bucket, so i can carry the mud past the dragon."
38210,Sheldon,five more minutes.
21828,Sheldon,well that’s disappointing. 
21832,Sheldon,"you asked what i wanted. i wanted to come in. i’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection c, females, paragraph four, coitus. roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”"
21837,Sheldon,but what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
21838,Sheldon,did it occur to you that was by design?
38226,Sheldon,"really? leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
38229,Sheldon,excellent choice.
38233,Sheldon,what do you want to talk about?
21851,Sheldon,you’re protected by your turtleneck.
38236,Sheldon,"like, has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
38238,Sheldon,"april 12th, 2005, bob’s big boy, toluca lake. raj had just introduced us to priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of hindu rebellion in the form of a bob’s super big boy hamburger. in order to preserve your friendship, you and howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. i had a patty melt."
38239,Sheldon,and raj.
38241,Sheldon,"violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
21860,Sheldon,give me that. 
38249,Sheldon,ta-da. it’s short for da-da-da-da!
38253,Sheldon,"the fun loving, and morally loose, miss maggie mcgeary."
38256,Sheldon,"it’s pretty convincing, huh? and it wasn’t even a real person. and here is the clincher. a lock of maggie’s flaming auburn hair."
38257,Sheldon,from an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
38259,Sheldon,"and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation. because i too know absolutely nothing about priya’s preferences in male companionship. and with that, i will re-zip my lip."
38260,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve heard of that place, isn’t that pasadena’s favourite irish watering hole."
38261,Sheldon,"did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
38262,Sheldon,"sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable."
38265,Sheldon,"may i point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying maggie mcgeary, she sounds lovely."
38270,Sheldon,and i’m sorry. but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. we are no longer friends.
38271,Sheldon,with real puffing smoke?
38272,Sheldon,alright. but i’m watching you.
38279,Sheldon,nothing. it was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
38281,Sheldon,"you know, i try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
38283,Sheldon,not particularly.
38285,Sheldon,of course. why do you have to make things so complicated?
38286,Sheldon,yes.
38288,Sheldon,and here is my justice league membership card. but that doesn’t prove i know batman.
38292,Sheldon,that’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
38297,Sheldon,"is there anything else? where would you like to start? he refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books i lend him. he crashed the mars rover while attempting to impress a woman. he recommended that i go see the third matrix movie because it was, and i quote, just as good as the first one. if that’s not irresponsible, i don’t know what is."
38299,Sheldon,"that was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
38305,Sheldon,who knows? i haven’t watched any scary movies recently. i’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. and it’s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull.
38308,Sheldon,interesting. so you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
38309,Sheldon,excuse me?
38316,Sheldon,"yes. i’d like to offer a laudatory statement about howard’s many excellent qualities that i believe will tip the scales back in his favour. howard joel wolowitz. h is for honesty, of which he has much. o’s for outstanding, which he is such. w’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. a’s for artistic, his ability…"
38317,Sheldon,but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go.
38336,Sheldon,"i believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. let’s see. harvey wallbanger. eh. sex on the beach. i hardly think so. rob roy, silk slipper, mad hatter. ooh! i’ll have a rosewater ricky."
38343,Sheldon,"i see. you’re saying i’m facing starfleet academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the kobayashi maru."
38348,Sheldon,"no, you can’t reprogram people. to james tiberius kirk. "
38356,Sheldon,no. i love my mother. my feelings for my spot are much greater. it is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. and now it’s yours.
38357,Sheldon,high five. not too hard. thank you.
38358,Sheldon,i changed my mind. get out of my spot.
38360,Sheldon,there’s no switch. just listen and learn.
38363,Sheldon,"may i point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
38367,Sheldon,what happened to the leonard hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of star trek: nemesis?
38371,Sheldon,"wait, now, we don’t know that yet. he isn’t finished. i have a girlfriend and you don’t who?"
38373,Sheldon,hugh.
38375,Sheldon,"under normal circumstances i’d say, i told you so. but as i have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. therefore, i will be replacing it with the phrase i informed you thusly."
38387,Sheldon,"listen to what mr. wil wheaton is tweeting. best seats in house for raiders screening. suck on that, sheldon cooper."
38397,Sheldon,"trouble is my middle name, leonard. actually, it’s lee, but i prefer trouble."
38406,Sheldon,aw.
38409,Sheldon,"if it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
38410,Sheldon,i’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
38411,Sheldon,"oh, friggety-frak. not this again."
38412,Sheldon,"leonard, penny, excellent. i’d like to say i’m very happy that you’re back together, and if i can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, i will. in the meantime, i’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address penny’s annoying personal habits."
38426,Sheldon,"chuck norris wishes. in binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. all chuck norris backwards gets you is sirron kcuhc."
38427,Sheldon,aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
38428,Sheldon,"well, you’re the expert. if the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then i yield."
38429,Sheldon,thank you.
38433,Sheldon,localized to what region?
38436,Sheldon,then why did you ask?
38446,Sheldon,"a cross we all must bear. you know, in difficult moments like this, i often turn to a force greater than myself."
38449,Sheldon,cheap science fiction?
38458,Sheldon,amy’s changed. i might have to let her go.
38461,Sheldon,forget science. she’s horny.
38464,Sheldon,it’s illegal to spay a human being.
38465,Sheldon,oh. oh! you mean something i could do.
38466,Sheldon,"well, i was hoping to avoid this. but i might as well get it over with. thank you, penny. i’ll let you know what happens."
38468,Sheldon,look at this stamp. on what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
38473,Sheldon,i’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
38481,Sheldon,"zack, i’m sorry you’re stupid. have a milk dud."
38488,Sheldon,"in the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
38489,Sheldon,of course. we’re coming as the justice league of america.
38492,Sheldon,i was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of betty and veronica.
38497,Sheldon,amy farrah fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. she isn’t the free spirit i am.
38498,Sheldon,we’re going to be late. i’m pacing nervously.
38499,Sheldon,this is how the flash paces.
38511,Sheldon,"obviously, we’re no longer a justice league. we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes."
38517,Sheldon,"no, wait! i have a speech."
38526,Sheldon,oh!
38528,Sheldon,"you have so few good ideas, leonard. and you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
38530,Sheldon,hardly. consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. a young woman alone in the big city. her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
38535,Sheldon,a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
38540,Sheldon,"you missed chief science officer, chairman of the board, and head of the secret santa committee."
38547,Sheldon,"if you say so, boss."
38552,Sheldon,another happy accident.
38556,Sheldon,"when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
38557,Sheldon,"all right, let’s get right to the vote. show of hands all those opposed to leonard and his reign of tyranny."
38566,Sheldon,"good morning, friend howard. friend raj. i see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. perhaps they would taste better out of these."
38578,Sheldon,"don’t beat around the bush, leonard. if you don’t want me here, just say the word, and i’ll leave."
38579,Sheldon,could have beaten around the bush a little.
38588,Sheldon,"i didn’t say that. but no, i don’t."
38590,Sheldon,"i know, it’s baffling.  nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen."
38593,Sheldon,do you have those little marshmallows?
38596,Sheldon,really? leonard wants me back?
38597,Sheldon,"well, we sure saw that coming."
38598,Sheldon,you know what i’m going to do? i am going to sit here and just let them stew.
38600,Sheldon,"oh, no. mrs. mary cooper didn’t raise her no liars."
38601,Sheldon,no.
38603,Sheldon,"of course. he will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and i will know it to be."
38604,Sheldon,"oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
38610,Sheldon,bored.
38614,Sheldon,"in order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
38622,Sheldon,it’s eleven fifteen. i’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
38625,Sheldon,no. amy?
38633,Sheldon,can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
38635,Sheldon,"howard is a complete and total ass, bernadette is in penny’s bed, amy bites, and penny may or may not have coitus with leonard."
38641,Sheldon,"all right, why don’t we open it up to q&a from the audience?"
38642,Sheldon,must be out of range.
38650,Sheldon,"it’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
38661,Sheldon,perhaps two. i’d like to master the craft.
38662,Sheldon,"it has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, i suck the big one."
38677,Sheldon,all right.
38696,Sheldon,"east texas. a warm summer night. a woman, mary, stands on a porch. in the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. woo-woo. the droning buzz of cicadas. zzzzzzzzz. a coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. aw-aw-aw! out in the woods, an owl screeches."
38706,Sheldon,"oh, shelly? a man’s here to take you away to the future. be sure to pack clean underwear."
38715,Sheldon,aha! the tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
38716,Sheldon,"i don’t care, it’s demeaning. and i refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the texas state fair. which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a star trek ensign’s uniform."
38719,Sheldon,tell him dr. cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of god.
38720,Sheldon,"don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
38723,Sheldon,that’s it. prepare to be minimized.
38724,Sheldon,your lab is funded by some middle-eastern dilettante?
38729,Sheldon,"oh, the humanities!"
38730,Sheldon,"an entire dinner to talk about your research? where you going, the drive-thru at jack in the box?"
38734,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where sandra bullock is?"
38735,Sheldon,"you know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
38751,Sheldon,are you just getting home?
38752,Sheldon,"that’s a good sign, right?"
38753,Sheldon,i’m so proud of you! you sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
38756,Sheldon,"smart. get paid up front. yeah, i think you have a real knack for gigolo work, leonard."
38763,Sheldon,"cocoa, leonard. focus. i’m down in the dumps here."
38766,Sheldon,that’s what tertiary friends are for.
38775,Sheldon,"given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
38792,Sheldon,i can’t do that. what if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
38794,Sheldon,"no, i’ll go to your haggis party. but i’m telling you, this is adness. this is utter and coplete adness."
38797,Sheldon,"and be a social pariah? oh, you know that’s not my style."
38802,Sheldon,"oh, what fun. we’re like hippies at a love-in."
38803,Sheldon,"yeah, right on, man. right on. oh, look, it’s harry potter and 98% of the sorcerer’s stone."
38813,Sheldon,don’t worry. my problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
38824,Sheldon,okay. i have guests coming. i’m afraid i’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
38830,Sheldon,"patience, patience, barry. the whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
38834,Sheldon,"surprisingly, yes."
38837,Sheldon,"forgive me, but i think you’ll find my story is more interesting."
38840,Sheldon,"all right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. who’s ready to play some vintage video games? and tonight’s selections include colecovision’s smurf rescue in gargamel’s castle, atari’s cookie monster munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, zork. pick me, pick me. i’m fun."
38842,Sheldon,no.
38847,Sheldon,"then it’s not chili. real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
38849,Sheldon,"priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
38858,Sheldon,not knowing is part of the fun. was that the motto of your community college?
38859,Sheldon,this deck is rigged in some fashion.
38863,Sheldon, leonard?
38869,Sheldon,"pick a card, sheldon. now look at it, and put it back in the deck. now do you remember your card? of course i do, i have an eidetic memory. my apologies. now shuffle the cards. shuffling. wait here. processing image, cross-referencing."
38870,Sheldon,i’m reverse engineering wolowitz’s magic trick.
38874,Sheldon,"and is this my card? rats! i wonder if howard used a radioactive tracer. where am i going to find uranium-235 this time of night? come on, craigslist."
38875,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve been meaning to tell you, i figured out your magic trick."
38877,Sheldon,all right. pick a card.
38878,Sheldon,bippity-boppity-boo.
38880,Sheldon,"i said, ta-da. show’s over."
38895,Sheldon,doctor cooper.
38898,Sheldon,it’s all gone. all gone.
38907,Sheldon,stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
38912,Sheldon,what?
38915,Sheldon,excellent! it’s in a cul-de-sac. we can box him in.
38916,Sheldon,carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
38924,Sheldon,that’s uncanny.
38946,Sheldon,no. we failed in our noble quest.
38954,Sheldon,"fine. in the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?"
38955,Sheldon,"i believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. excuse me. dr. greene, question?"
38963,Sheldon,"leonard, the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. we have to do our part, too.  that was uncalled for, but i’ll play along. ow! i had an unusual experience with amy last night."
38973,Sheldon,"oh, i’m back to trains. woo-woo."
38976,Sheldon,"if you don’t mind, i’d like to stop listening to you and start talking."
38980,Sheldon,"i’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. at johnson elementary school, the phrase shelly cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
38994,Sheldon,pun intended?
39004,Sheldon,"mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
39012,Sheldon,"dr. leonard hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. do you waive reading of the charges?"
39027,Sheldon,the mean indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. congratulations. pizza night will now be at your apartment. order one.
39038,Sheldon,"against my will. in the south, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century vienna."
39051,Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
39055,Sheldon,"i understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but i really need to talk to smart amy now."
39057,Sheldon,"well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. that’s a little outside my comfort zone."
39060,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re up. i’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. i’d like you to sign it."
39082,Sheldon,"it’s what i do. but wait, there’s more. i also invented two new chess pieces. the serpent, and the old woman."
39083,Sheldon,"when the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. ugh."
39084,Sheldon,"unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the grand empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
39086,Sheldon,and…
39096,Sheldon,"all right. come in. you look positively orange with loneliness. no, i don’t see that catching on at all."
39105,Sheldon,i like cows.
39113,Sheldon,they were out of scones.
39120,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, do i really need to connect the dots for you? the backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
39122,Sheldon,he drank from leonard’s glass. words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
39123,Sheldon,"oh, this is a nightmare!"
39126,Sheldon,fine. thank you for asking. i love you so much.
39130,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord!"
39132,Sheldon,hello.
39147,Sheldon,"i’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
39175,Sheldon,"all right. this is a form indemnifying me from your use of leonard’s bedroom. sign here, indicating that i tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
39178,Sheldon,"good news, raj. i got the blood work back from the lab. you’re okay to stay for a while."
39179,Sheldon,"not important. your sugar was a little high. i’d follow up with your regular physician. in the meantime, i have some paperwork here for you to go over."
39186,Sheldon,"yes, it’s “penny, get your own wi-fi.” no spaces."
39187,Sheldon,"my new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  uh, nice touch, by the way."
39188,Sheldon,the same thing that happened to homo erectus. he was replaced by a superior species.
39191,Sheldon,here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
39193,Sheldon,when does a monkey have a trunk?
39196,Sheldon,"i said, what are you doing here?"
39210,Sheldon,"gentlemen, if i may interject, i’ve decided my rank will be captain. if it’s good enough for kirk, crunch and kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
39211,Sheldon,"for the record, i do have genitals. they’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
39213,Sheldon,"who said that? leonard, i can hear your voice, but i can’t see you."
39214,Sheldon,"oh, there you are. leonard, i know you’re upset about recent events, and i have someone here to help. "
39217,Sheldon,"all right, this is a google earth view of the field of battle."
39220,Sheldon,"this is a game to you? uh, was the battle of antietam a game? huh? was the sack of rome a game?"
39228,Sheldon,it’s eight o’clock in the morning in mumbai. how can she have dinner?
39231,Sheldon,paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. dinfast .
39243,Sheldon,"good. on the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. i must say, i am enjoying your new chair."
39250,Sheldon,"yes, i did. and now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the redwood national forest."
39254,Sheldon,you need to remove that chair from the building. it’s a health hazard.
39257,Sheldon,all right. it is a comfortable chair.
39258,Sheldon,"no, thank you. (sees insect. more appear and swarm all over him. he jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. jumps up and runs out to penny’s apartment."
39267,Sheldon,no.
39270,Sheldon,i was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
39275,Sheldon,thank you.
39277,Sheldon,"penny, a moment. we just had thai food. in that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
39281,Sheldon,"no, penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
39300,Sheldon,you see a dragon.
39301,Sheldon,"when you play chutes and ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
39303,Sheldon,"because you don’t have a girlfriend? well, good lord, if that becomes a reason not to play dungeons and dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
39306,Sheldon,a side of corn succotash. hmm. interesting.
39310,Sheldon,"and now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. bam! that’s what i’m talking about!"
39313,Sheldon,the dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
39318,Sheldon,"no, you’re wrong. see, as you know, a few years ago, i achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. well, from time to time, i notarize banking documents for raj. the koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re richie rich rich."
39331,Sheldon,what are you doing? two fifty is already the discounted price.
39335,Sheldon,"i’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
39339,Sheldon,sucker. didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
39344,Sheldon,"at this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. until you either do not go or go to wil wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. i’m characterizing this phenomenon as schrodinger’s friendship."
39346,Sheldon,"in case you have forgotten, schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
39348,Sheldon,"mohammed is the most common first name in the world, lee, the most common surname. as i didn’t know the answer, i thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
39351,Sheldon,"don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. and yes, it sure is, buddy."
39352,Sheldon,"would you prefer a simpler application of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which i could either know where you are or whether i like you, but not both?"
39353,Sheldon,"in fact, i have 61 of them. would you like to see the list?"
39354,Sheldon,you just got off the list. would you like back on it? this’ll just take a moment. it’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
39356,Sheldon,"as a child, i loved wesley crusher, wil wheaton’s character on star trek. so, i drove for hours by bus to a star trek convention at which wil wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that i could get my wesley crusher action figure signed. but he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on hollywood squares. oh, damn! the floppy failed. well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the verbatim corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
39362,Sheldon,brent spiner?
39365,Sheldon,"yeah, even that. you look like a dork."
39369,Sheldon,"to sheldon, sorry this took so long. your friend, wil wheaton."
39372,Sheldon,"you’ve already signed something, brent spiner. your name on my list. from this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
39377,Sheldon,"good, ’cause i got you everything you need to make it. you are in for a treat. my mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
39381,Sheldon,told you.
39384,Sheldon,"well, there’s actually big news on the amy front. she’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
39385,Sheldon,"and that reminds me of another saying. you can lead a chicken to crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
39387,Sheldon,get them before they get us.
39393,Sheldon,double stuf?
39406,Sheldon,but i apologized. and that was hard for me because i didn’t do anything wrong.
39407,Sheldon,"i’m not going, and you can’t make me."
39408,Sheldon,"well, i’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
39413,Sheldon,"no, i’m just allergic to people who get nobel prizes for no good reason."
39425,Sheldon,"i know, it filled in last year. i didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
39431,Sheldon,"well, i know, but he means well. sing."
39448,Sheldon,it’s a snake. a terrifying snake.
39449,Sheldon,stop talking like that. you’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
39457,Sheldon,"you know, the german philosopher, friedrich nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
39458,Sheldon,it’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
39473,Sheldon,"what? no. you mean this was all a ruse? oh, how could i be so stu… ."
39478,Sheldon,"ah. new topic. women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
39479,Sheldon,she popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
39480,Sheldon,can we? stand back while i turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
39483,Sheldon,"sorry. i’m a little distracted. i can’t seem to get in touch with amy. i tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
39489,Sheldon,where are you going?
39497,Sheldon,always.
39500,Sheldon,"neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
39502,Sheldon,the two of you need to get your women in line!
39503,Sheldon,"last night i was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional amy farrah fowler. this on a night that i had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my lego death star. and why? your gal pals, penny and bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my lego fun time."
39505,Sheldon,"you invited her to lunch four years ago. everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
39515,Sheldon," go away, bird."
39518,Sheldon,"please, that’s a seagull. if you’re not going to help, don’t help."
39524,Sheldon,"for an audience with the queen, yes. for an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  what am i thinking? whiskers!"
39525,Sheldon,a minute.
39532,Sheldon,this is ridiculous. i’m a grown man from texas. this isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. it’s just a blue jay.  no!
39540,Sheldon,"my phone’s on the desk over there. take a picture of us together. make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. if you were a dove, i’d call you lovey-dovey. oh. who am i kidding? this isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. you’re just my little lovey-dovey, aren’t you?"
39545,Sheldon,"well? what do you think of new comic book night? magic, huh?"
39547,Sheldon,"i know what this is about. given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. yes. and if i may suggest, consider changing disciplines. yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. one of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. you could have fun with that."
39551,Sheldon,"fine. the record shall so reflect. now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
39553,Sheldon,where’s stuart?
39554,Sheldon,who are you?
39563,Sheldon,"i’m in the matrix, leonard, i see everything."
39566,Sheldon,you are free to believe whatever you like. and unfriend rajesh koothrappali.
39568,Sheldon,and unfriend howard wolowitz.
39573,Sheldon,thank you.
39575,Sheldon,"a date. you and me. dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
39576,Sheldon,no. why is everyone so obsessed with amy and stuart? and whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
39578,Sheldon,i believe i do.
39580,Sheldon,"are you sure? that would explain so much. your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
39599,Sheldon,i believe that you’re capable of great change. like when i finally got you to stop saying valentimes day.
39601,Sheldon,you asked penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
39606,Sheldon,"was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
39609,Sheldon,"you know, the holidays are just around the corner. maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
39610,Sheldon,nobel prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from stockholm.
39611,Sheldon,"look at these men. they’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than god gave a goose. you should pay attention, leonard. someday this could be you up there."
39624,Sheldon,a little bit? the man super glued hershey’s kisses to your nipples.
39625,Sheldon,this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard. one of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
39639,Sheldon,"in case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
39641,Sheldon,"oh, there it is, tacos."
39643,Sheldon,"the dark knight has your back. he’s scared, but he has your back."
39650,Sheldon,a magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. this is an ordinary top hat. you’ve chosen that card freely. i do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
39653,Sheldon,it’s still there. takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
39654,Sheldon,"and that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at the cheesecake factory?"
39658,Sheldon,"yeah, me, too. triple digits, i’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
39659,Sheldon,"mm-hmm. mm-hmm. ooh, 101! air’s getting a bit thin up here."
39663,Sheldon,what if they simply don’t excite me?
39666,Sheldon,had a rough night. i thought i’d go for a walk and clear my head.
39674,Sheldon,how does that work?
39680,Sheldon,"well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
39682,Sheldon," trust me, we are not a couple."
39683,Sheldon,"remarkable. diamonds, crystallized carbon. every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. but just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
39684,Sheldon,really. talk to me about that pocket watch.
39689,Sheldon,i told you.
39693,Sheldon,"oh, i would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. we could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. oh! my life-size cardboard mr. spock is here! i know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
39698,Sheldon,sarcasm?
39707,Sheldon,leonard?
39708,Sheldon,"uh, can’t complain. thanks for asking. well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?"
39715,Sheldon,seems unlikely. did you bring your asthma inhaler?
39720,Sheldon,it’s not about you. it’s about a poor immigrant from pakistan trying to make his way in america by working the graveyard shift at the colorado boulevard chevron.
39727,Sheldon,i’ve got to go with leonard on this. he is wrong more than anyone i know.
39729,Sheldon,this is a disaster. i distinctly ordered the leonard nimoy mr. spock cardboard standee. why would i feel safer with zachary quinto at the foot of my bed?
39730,Sheldon,"you’re right, i’ll give him a shot."
39732,Sheldon,"hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. over the next 52 weeks, you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
39741,Sheldon,vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
39760,Sheldon,"yeah, really? you think those hippies in washington and oregon can stop them?"
39761,Sheldon,"all righty! an 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. the streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. oh, excellent choice. now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
39776,Sheldon,"hello, dear friends. and dr. hofstadter."
39777,Sheldon,"‘sup? my apologies. i would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
39780,Sheldon,"well, if amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled you’re welcome, mankind. all right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. uh, dentist. okay, we can circle back to that one. um, well, who wants to take me wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? anyone? oh. that one had hoot written all over it. um, all right, uh, dermatologist? allergist? podiatrist? supercuts? okay, okay, here’s a fun one. um, i need a new picture frame and i have a hankering for swedish meatballs. who wants to spend the day with me at ikea?"
39785,Sheldon,"great. great. so, what’s new with your family? how’s your mother? is she alive?"
39791,Sheldon,‘sup?
39795,Sheldon,power failure. implementing power-failure protocol.
39796,Sheldon,"oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because i happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. please try not to see anything by this light. it’s not for you."
39801,Sheldon,"excuse me, leonard."
39824,Sheldon,"oh, oh, lord, that multiplication error! he thought he carried the one. but he didn’t."
39834,Sheldon,"will they, leonard? "
39838,Sheldon,my family took a trip to florida when i was a child. a seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. i got the message.
39845,Sheldon,"okay, what do we start with? maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? ha-ha, i’m a freak!"
39848,Sheldon,i have plenty of experience in biology. i bought a tamagotchi in 1998. and it’s still alive. let’s do this.
39851,Sheldon,biologists are mean.
39853,Sheldon,i intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
39857,Sheldon,"aw, nuts! one…"
39864,Sheldon,"it’s not. i’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
39866,Sheldon,"oh, dear. "
39867,Sheldon,i’m on vacation. social convention dictates that i let my hair down at a local watering hole. social convention is stupid.
39874,Sheldon,i was not myself. i had lost a lot of thumb blood.
39876,Sheldon,i’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
39878,Sheldon,that the soap was…
39884,Sheldon,"what are you doing here, kripke?"
39889,Sheldon,i’m sorry. we just need a word.
39896,Sheldon,kripke. come in. i’m making tea. would you like a cup?
39897,Sheldon,fine. in the interest of preserving our friendship…
39905,Sheldon,"not pistols. minds. a trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. star trek trivia, star trek: next generation trivia, star trek: deep space nine trivia, star trek: voyager trivia, or model trains."
39906,Sheldon,five what?
39908,Sheldon,"use the force, sheldon. use the force.  i’m gonna need more force."
39909,Sheldon,what do you propose?
39915,Sheldon,professor rothman. this isn’t your office any more. you’re retired.
39921,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
39924,Sheldon,how can i relax? my nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict professor rothman.
39935,Sheldon,"yes, there are."
39945,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
39950,Sheldon,yes. do you have something i could use as a cape?
39952,Sheldon,"i got to run. but not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
39954,Sheldon,"eh, why? my spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
39959,Sheldon,you’re right. i should embrace the chaos.
39967,Sheldon,"maybe, maybe not. maybe tomorrow i start a bongo band and tour the world."
39969,Sheldon,"wherever the music takes me, kitten. i play bongos walking down the stairs.  oh! oh! never play bongos walking down the stairs."
39970,Sheldon,what’s going on?
39990,Sheldon,then no. what else?
39998,Sheldon,"hello, penny. i just stopped by to bring you this gift."
40000,Sheldon,"all right. i thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. these are cooper coupons. these are for various things i can do for you. um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. um, oh, this is fun one. this is an afternoon with me at the california science center, where i point out their mistakes."
40018,Sheldon,armin who?
40031,Sheldon,"knock, knock."
40033,Sheldon,muon!
40035,Sheldon,well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
40045,Sheldon,"well, i’m not going to dignify that with a response."
40062,Sheldon,"oh, nice job, man-hands."
40063,Sheldon,"yes. yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. yeah, let’s all be mad at stuart."
40069,Sheldon,yes.
40070,Sheldon,"okay. leonard, even though i don’t have one any more, i hope you have fun playing with it."
40071,Sheldon,big fat whopper. i hope it breaks.
40076,Sheldon,"please, please, please let me meet hawking."
40077,Sheldon,but i said i’m sorry.
40086,Sheldon,oh!
40091,Sheldon,"no, sir, no, i took my dad’s desk chair, attached a speak & spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. granted most people thought i was r2-d2, but still, i got a lot of candy."
40102,Sheldon,what kinds of things?
40103,Sheldon,of course.
40104,Sheldon,all right. what would you like me to do first?
40105,Sheldon,"oh. by all means. when i was a boy, i would polish my mee-maw’s silver. and she would entertain me with stories about growing up in oklahoma. interesting woman. you know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
40106,Sheldon,that’s a lot of belt buckles.
40108,Sheldon,"oh, i-i buffed them with turtle wax. the man down at pep boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
40109,Sheldon,my mee-maw must never know of this. now will you give professor hawking my paper?
40112,Sheldon,hello.
40115,Sheldon,"because if i don’t, he won’t give my paper to stephen hawking. he’s a famous physicist."
40116,Sheldon,that’s close enough.
40117,Sheldon,"because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. you don’t think i’m condescending, do you?"
40122,Sheldon,i want you to tell me that howard is being mean to me for no reason.
40126,Sheldon,"oh, no, you know, i’m not really the holding kind of… oh!"
40130,Sheldon,okay.
40132,Sheldon,you’re obviously good at what you do.
40140,Sheldon,"thank you. it just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
40142,Sheldon,"no, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. i-i don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
40145,Sheldon,wrong. leonard?
40148,Sheldon,"all right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. now, as a human, i appreciate beethoven. as a fungus, i have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. and no thank you, expensive concessions. because as an algae, i’ll just snack on this sunlight."
40149,Sheldon,"well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
40151,Sheldon,"boo, wine! but yay, trains. i’m in."
40155,Sheldon,oh. i guess you’re just friends with anybody.  aagh!
40162,Sheldon,here.
40167,Sheldon,you’re kidding. shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
40188,Sheldon,"bishop to queen four, level two. check."
40189,Sheldon,i’m fine.
40194,Sheldon,"it’s awful. this morning, she arranged for me to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day. it, it’s usually only open to children. she got them to make an exception."
40195,Sheldon,"they let me blow the whistle, leonard."
40196,Sheldon,i know. and it gets worse. her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
40197,Sheldon,"no! would you please stop referencing that infernal book? for example, this morning, i was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. oh, what has that vixen done to me, leonard? and how do i make it stop?"
40200,Sheldon,"well, no wonder the women are winning."
40204,Sheldon,"remarkable. in just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath howard’s keister. and all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been tetris and mail-order brides."
40206,Sheldon,that’s what you said about the green lantern movie. you were 114 minutes of wrong.
40214,Sheldon,"while a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
40218,Sheldon,"would you like some aloe vera? you just got burned. all right, my turn. howard, bernadette. daq tu’ tah daq yin tlhej ghajtah."
40225,Sheldon,"you don’t even know what it is, do you? the anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. as i am doing so eloquently right now."
40233,Sheldon,"oh, absolutely. i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that i can’t outsource that to an indian."
40235,Sheldon,tell him yourself.
40248,Sheldon,"okay, my turn. let me talk to him."
40253,Sheldon,over and out. 
40256,Sheldon,that’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
40263,Sheldon,equally ridiculous. let’s go.
40264,Sheldon,this insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
40266,Sheldon,it’s not fair. penny isn’t making leonard hold hands.
40267,Sheldon,sweaty? unhygienic? looks dumb? take your pick.
40269,Sheldon,"so, if she wants to end her pair-bond with leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?"
40273,Sheldon,"uh, fine. fyi, secret-keeping? hate it. hand-holding? not a fan. hammerhead shark? i love that thing. yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head."
40287,Sheldon,nan
40288,Sheldon,you frightened me.
40295,Sheldon,"oh, very well. i can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. she told me that you were thinking of ending it with leonard."
40306,Sheldon,"fairy god monster, i win. your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."
40308,Sheldon,"yeah, for now. but that woman has a death wish, leonard. she talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. if i were you, i’d get a back-up."
40319,Sheldon,i am glad you asked. are you familiar with the higgs boson?
40323,Sheldon,"that’s a good point. my time is much too valuable. you know, perhaps i should find someone to do it for me. you know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour."
40327,Sheldon,"all right, ms. jenson. uh, before we begin, may i offer you a refreshment? water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?"
40329,Sheldon,"excellent, yeah. that was a ruse. they’re not the best. physics is the best. and by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. all right, so i see here you’re from des moines, iowa. uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from stanford university. oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. i hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss."
40330,Sheldon,"i did a comprehensive background check. medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   i trust you paid off those parking tickets."
40334,Sheldon,no. i have people for that now. you’re up.
40337,Sheldon,"half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?"
40338,Sheldon,half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
40359,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. now, how can you not get that?"
40373,Sheldon,all right. let’s play physics fiesta.
40375,Sheldon,"bueno, mi amigo."
40381,Sheldon,no.
40387,Sheldon,"amy, do something. amy, help. amy, stop that. amy, penny, both of you, stop it."
40393,Sheldon,"interesting hypothesis. let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment."
40417,Sheldon,"paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. "
40431,Sheldon,not challenging? i was humiliating the man. i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl.
40432,Sheldon,really?
40433,Sheldon,"good lord, what have i done?"
40434,Sheldon,play. play. play. play. play.
40439,Sheldon,"i was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. why does everyone love me except stephen hawking?"
40442,Sheldon,"hmm. beats me. now, i know hawking’s not busy because i can see he’s playing other people right now."
40455,Sheldon,"oh, but i want to be hawking’s friend."
40458,Sheldon,"‘course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? and send."
40477,Sheldon,"come to think of it, i would! you, little lady, are on fire."
40485,Sheldon,"fine. it’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. i was this close."
40487,Sheldon,"hmm. eat one of your luna bars. very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry."
40490,Sheldon, angry amy.
40507,Sheldon,"no, she won’t. i’m great."
40508,Sheldon," wil wheaton! wait, how many was that?"
40513,Sheldon,my fists are not up here because i’m milking a giant invisible cow. they’re up to beat an apology out of you.
40514,Sheldon,"well, that was a long bus ride for not very much."
40523,Sheldon,i’m quite sure. good day.
40525,Sheldon,i just told you.
40526,Sheldon,"well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court."
40528,Sheldon,you think you don’t care?
40538,Sheldon,the first forty-three parallel universes i’ve checked proved to be empty. i see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
40545,Sheldon,that’s my parking spot.
40569,Sheldon,"all right, colour me intrigued."
40574,Sheldon,"actually, i have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says i can. give up, wolowitz. you’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. there is nothing you could possibly do to… "
40575,Sheldon,"oh, yes, they are. i mean, what?"
40588,Sheldon,to burying the hatchet.
40589,Sheldon,"yes. according to information i gleaned from yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. i believe i may have a similar problem. this cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle."
40591,Sheldon,"lipid residue. an anal autograph. a colon calling card, if you will."
40597,Sheldon,"however, the spider-man lyrics posit that spider-man, spider-man does whatever a spider can."
40600,Sheldon,"no, you can’t use that one. that’s mine. uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental united states, alaska or hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in china."
40601,Sheldon,"actually, you can’t have that one either. it’s too good. sorry."
40619,Sheldon,"oh, i’m hanging in there. thanks for asking."
40631,Sheldon,"very well, then. get over my knee. let’s begin."
40636,Sheldon,"yeah, like a bunch of savages."
40638,Sheldon,"oh, where to begin? trees indoors. overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. and the absurd custom of one stocking. everyone knows socks belong in pairs. who uses one sock?"
40640,Sheldon,"oh, a scroll. i like scrolls. they’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. after stone tablets and skywriting. you have all been summoned to join a thrilling dungeons and dragons adventure. your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. i like where this is heading. your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. oh, that’s a saucy twist. that leader’s name, santa claus. no, no, no."
40641,Sheldon,"fun? mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly."
40642,Sheldon,i signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
40644,Sheldon,"i know they’re making a rhetorical point, i just don’t know what it is."
40649,Sheldon,"brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. when a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel."
40655,Sheldon,"well it’s a game of the imagination, leonard. paint a picture."
40659,Sheldon,since when is eggnog a christmas drink? eggs are available all year ’round. i’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
40661,Sheldon,no wonder you love christmas. that sounds amazing.
40663,Sheldon,all right. i think i cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
40668,Sheldon,"pop-pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. but you didn’t bring him back, did you? no, instead, i got lincoln logs. well, you can build a lot of neat things out of lincoln logs, but pop-pop ain’t one of ’em. and now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. well, sorry, mr. kringle, but today’s not your day. i’m leaving you here to rot, and i hope the ogres feast on your bones. i take the skeleton key, and i toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, i give santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!"
40676,Sheldon,"well, i must say, leonard, when i first heard your idea for giant jenga, i was sceptical."
40697,Sheldon,"you don’t know? oh, you poor dear. your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. you made an inappropriate sexual advance towards dr. hofstadter."
40704,Sheldon,"good to know. yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the council of ladies.  hello. i see. uh, what time? very well, then. huh. that was the human resources department at the university. apparently, my assistant alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace."
40705,Sheldon,"hmm, let me think. nothing. i’m a delight."
40706,Sheldon, human resources department.
40711,Sheldon,"oh! i see the confusion here. no, no, alex thought i was singling her out. no. i meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? even you. you’re a slave."
40723,Sheldon,"interesting. do you recall this conversation? leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? no, sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost."
40725,Sheldon,"so to answer your question, no, it’s not better."
40727,Sheldon,i think you should turn on the gps.
40730,Sheldon,i found a hack online. i was able to upload mp3 recordings of my voice to your gps.
40738,Sheldon,stealing is against the law!
40741,Sheldon,you’re right. nice going.
40746,Sheldon,"gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. we’re starfleet officers and a member of the borg collective."
40750,Sheldon,"scotty was on the original series, and we’re next generation. so, joke’s on you."
40756,Sheldon,wait. they might be hostile.
40765,Sheldon,"there is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. i don’t know where you’re from, but where i’m from, that means i’m not doing okay."
40766,Sheldon,tea is for when i’m upset. i’m not upset. the university’s forcing me to work with kripke. i’m outraged.
40768,Sheldon,"see, i did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. i am angrier than ever and filled with despair."
40778,Sheldon,i’m fine.
40779,Sheldon,yes.
40793,Sheldon,"what can i say, you know? she enjoys my genitals. i am giving them to her on a nightly basis."
40799,Sheldon,"well, first of all, i’m quite fond of amy."
40801,Sheldon,it’s a possibility.
40802,Sheldon,fine.
40809,Sheldon,toys? i do have a model rocket next to my bed.
40811,Sheldon,"you brought up the subject. i contributed an interesting fact on that subject. it’s called the art of conversation. okay, your turn."
40814,Sheldon,"yes, and i have a theory why. because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. i think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman."
40822,Sheldon,"leonard, wait."
40824,Sheldon,one vintage mr. mxyzptlk action figure. that’s leonard’s.
40828,Sheldon,"oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. he would just go whenever the mood struck him."
40831,Sheldon,wait. here who is where?
40832,Sheldon,um…
40838,Sheldon,"yes. all is forgiven, so come back home. i’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then i’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy."
40850,Sheldon,"i suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair."
40858,Sheldon,you can’t live here.
40865,Sheldon,i thought we were talking about the other thing.
40869,Sheldon,or maybe she doesn’t. let’s find out.
40873,Sheldon,"oh, no, no. that’s not going to happen, no. what i need you to do is find a valentine’s gift for my girlfriend."
40876,Sheldon,"now, see, i never would have thought to do that. clearly, i made a good choice farming this out to you. but i am telling you, amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. anyway, my socks are on. let’s knock them off."
40877,Sheldon,"now, amy already has a real harp. and it can play any song. what are you trying to pull here?"
40882,Sheldon,"wow. oh, this is truly remarkable."
40906,Sheldon,hello. how’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
40908,Sheldon,much better than i expected. she even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. watch. welcome to my world. not welcome to my world. welcome. not welcome.
40909,Sheldon,i know. i’m still learning to control it.
40912,Sheldon,um…
40913,Sheldon,"no. i didn’t start yet, it’s fine."
40922,Sheldon,"amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, i’m obligated to do something nice for you. so, yes, i’ll go to your dopey play."
40923,Sheldon,why not?
40931,Sheldon,why?
40932,Sheldon,"aw, for pete’s sake. can we go now?"
40933,Sheldon,"it’s about streetcars? oh, great. i won’t need this. "
40939,Sheldon,helping anyone. people should take care of themselves.
40940,Sheldon,i’m not saying people can’t use tools. even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
40945,Sheldon,we’re not. this time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
40957,Sheldon,thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
16384,Leonard,"uh, sheldon?"
16388,Leonard,"well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up."
16393,Leonard,perfect.
16397,Leonard,really? how could you tell?
16401,Leonard,oh. that’s too bad. i wonder what happened.
16404,Leonard,"oh, god."
16407,Leonard,it’s a splatter thing. there’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
16413,Leonard,"don’t tell anybody i told you, but i heard she might be breaking up with him."
16419,Leonard,not too bad. did you hear about howard and bernadette?
16423,Leonard,no.
16426,Leonard,you’re the one who told amy in the first place.
16434,Leonard,hey.
16435,Leonard,hope you’re hungry.
16437,Leonard,"good, good. everything okay between you two?"
16440,Leonard,"yeah, you do. you dog, you."
16442,Leonard,"oh, hold on, howard. there’s lots of better times."
16447,Leonard,what?
16457,Leonard,superceded!
16461,Leonard,i got you the lamb kabob.
16464,Leonard,"uh, captain kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
16466,Leonard,what’s the big deal?
16469,Leonard,then why can’t we tell your parents?
16470,Leonard,"no, he’s bluffing."
16471,Leonard,it’s blackmail!
16472,Leonard,this is ridiculous. 
16481,Leonard,"okay, well, i look forward to playing with you."
16487,Leonard,hadn’t really thought about it.
16492,Leonard,really? in front of your sister?
16497,Leonard,"well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, i don’t, oh, what’s the word i’m looking for?"
16499,Leonard,"i still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. not that i care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause i don’t."
16503,Leonard,i think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
16505,Leonard,"oh, oh, beekeeper to king 12. i capture your pope and release the swarm. checkmate on sheldon."
16508,Leonard,yes. it’s my water.
16515,Leonard,have you met bernadette’s parents?
16519,Leonard,"sheldon, let’s go!"
16524,Leonard,i’m fine. that’s nice that they’re getting along.
16525,Leonard,what are you talking about?
16527,Leonard,"no, i do not. you are a mean little man."
16529,Leonard,"every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, i’d put on a little show for her."
16550,Leonard,"hey, if i roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. if you do it, you’re still not a doctor."
16553,Leonard,"oh, you heard?"
16554,Leonard,sorry. does sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
16567,Leonard,sorry.
16585,Leonard,she lied.
16587,Leonard,"no, i’m fine with it."
16590,Leonard,"raj, come on. you fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. a month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
16605,Leonard,"yes, no and no."
16613,Leonard,"oh, uh, priya’s calling in a few minutes on skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
16618,Leonard,"yes, i’ve always admired that about you."
16649,Leonard,cool.  uh-oh!
16654,Leonard,oh! i didn’t even think of that. thanks.
16655,Leonard,"i don’t know about this, howard."
16667,Leonard,i thought you were reading.
16671,Leonard,"it was good, good. just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
16676,Leonard,what’s in the bag?
16677,Leonard,"ah, sure. that’d be nice."
16678,Leonard,wouldn’t you rather bring sheldon?
16684,Leonard,"oh, sorry. this wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
16686,Leonard,"well, hey, i’m just as much fun as you are."
16687,Leonard,"okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
16691,Leonard,and also for breaking the head off the ice swan so i could hold it against my pulled groin.
16694,Leonard,"okay. well, good night."
16695,Leonard,sounds like you had a great night.
16701,Leonard,maybe. we enter the dungeon.
16709,Leonard,you think she’s taking advantage of him?
16716,Leonard,what did you have in mind?
16720,Leonard,"yeah. it’s okay, i guess."
16721,Leonard,buh-buh-buh-buh! what do you want for it?
16725,Leonard,will you shut up?
16749,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, we’re going to wil’s. this is your last chance."
16754,Leonard,"really? brent spiner, mr. data himself. you love him."
16755,Leonard,"i’m going. live long and prosper, sheldon."
16760,Leonard,twelve.
16779,Leonard,these are delicious.
16783,Leonard,i hadn’t…
16785,Leonard,what are you gonna do? she wanted to see churches.
16786,Leonard,"oh, i’m not sure we should."
16798,Leonard,"sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. what’s that word?"
16801,Leonard,how many times are you gonna tell me? what’s with you?
16802,Leonard,right.
16805,Leonard,"excuse me.  a couple of circulars, nothing important."
16806,Leonard,"hang on.  you might be from texas, but i’m from new jersey."
16807,Leonard,check it out. jim lee drew this of me two years ago at comic con.
16818,Leonard,"okay, we used to go out, right?"
16824,Leonard,come on.
16835,Leonard,what are you doing?
16838,Leonard,no. i’m having a moral crisis.
16843,Leonard,do you mind? i’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
16845,Leonard,"damn it, i can’t. i can’t, i can’t do this."
16851,Leonard,it’s okay. did the right thing. you idiot!
16853,Leonard,"uh, not so good. we have to talk."
16857,Leonard,"uh, kind of?"
16866,Leonard,"come on, it’s your turn. we said we’d get more fresh air."
16868,Leonard,"if you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
16872,Leonard,"uh, she’s your friend. step up."
16891,Leonard,"oh, hey. you work the lunch shift?"
16895,Leonard,"i know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
16900,Leonard,what the hell is going on?
16902,Leonard,"sheldon, just ignore him."
16905,Leonard,sorry. do you think i’m overdressed?
16907,Leonard,"no, but she might think i think it’s a date even though i don’t."
16910,Leonard,"oh, yeah, sure. there’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in south america."
16919,Leonard,"see? now, that’s the great thing. we’re out as friends. this is not a date. sex is off the table. so, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. sorry. spoiler alert."
16921,Leonard,"come on, you enjoyed the movie. i saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
16928,Leonard,"you’re kidding me. uh, can i see you for a sec over here?"
16932,Leonard,i wear dorky t-shirts and glasses.
16937,Leonard,"no, it’s fine. you can ditch away."
16941,Leonard,"don’t worry about it. you know, there’s some guys over there. you should go talk to them."
16948,Leonard,"okay. so, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
16956,Leonard,"it’s probably for the best. for a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
16957,Leonard,"well, ho-hold on. what if the wizard casts a helmet of confusion spell on billy the kid’s cowboy hat?"
16959,Leonard,sure. i guess.
16963,Leonard,no. he wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
16983,Leonard,"yeah, it’s “penny already eats our food, she can pay for wi-fi.” no spaces."
16984,Leonard,you want to hear something weird?
16991,Leonard,"no, that was a different, different guy."
17003,Leonard,"you know, i can really do this by myself."
17004,Leonard,"no, you’re not. you’re here to see if i get my underwear pulled over my head."
17005,Leonard,you bet. i am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
17008,Leonard,"oh, hi."
17011,Leonard,the newcomb medal.
17020,Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
17028,Leonard,you got one for good luck.  i’ll get it.
17043,Leonard,"morning, jimmy."
17046,Leonard,that’s my french toast.
17047,Leonard,i might kill him right now.
17050,Leonard,"i’m not afraid of you any more, jimmy. now get out!  uh-oh."
17052,Leonard,mm-hmm. yep. i see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
17053,Leonard,"sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party."
17064,Leonard,sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
17073,Leonard,"you feel like trying something new for dinner? maybe indian, tex-mex?"
17075,Leonard,"we all do. now, how about dinner?"
17081,Leonard,"i didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship."
17083,Leonard,where on earth did you get that from?
17091,Leonard,"uh, let’s see. uh, i am an experimental physicist at cal-tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, i’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
17092,Leonard,"oh, god, no. the money’s pretty good. and i used the equipment to make my own bat-signal."
17093,Leonard,"not some kind of nerd, i am the king of the nerds."
17095,Leonard,good. remember that when i take my shirt off.
17096,Leonard,"me, too. so what do you think? are we gonna get back together?"
17098,Leonard,"oh, god."
17114,Leonard,"well, i want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. just, just help me out here. how does a miserable date end in sex?"
17118,Leonard,"well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? it could be more like a new version of software. penny and leonard 2.0. we can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
17124,Leonard,"well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
17126,Leonard,"obviously, when i saw that you were in ours, i went and used another one."
17146,Leonard,you know what? i don’t have to stand here and take this crap. 
17148,Leonard,what are we doing?
17153,Leonard,"no, i mean just you and me."
17158,Leonard,"well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. have you ever tried it?"
17161,Leonard,"before an application is released, they give it a trial run. w-we could do that. and if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
17164,Leonard,"great. you keep a list, i’ll keep a list. at some point, we’ll exchange."
17166,Leonard,"um, i’m not sure, but i think the right answer here is no."
17171,Leonard,it’s colour coded.
17176,Leonard,can you finish it later?
17179,Leonard,thank you.
17182,Leonard,you mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
17183,Leonard,"right. sorry, sorry."
17187,Leonard,hello? they gave me a band-aid. hospitals do not issue band-aids unless it is medically necessary. that is the law.
17192,Leonard,i have to get a lock for my door.
17196,Leonard,"i don’t know, what am i doing?"
17197,Leonard,aah!
17200,Leonard,"you know what, i’m so tired i can’t even think straight. i’m going home. will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
17208,Leonard,i’m gonna go home and take a nap.
17213,Leonard,"hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
17217,Leonard,what happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
17221,Leonard,i can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
17227,Leonard,"no, he’s crazy. sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
17233,Leonard,it’s not crazy.
17234,Leonard,i kind of like the sound of that.
17236,Leonard,can i sit in your spot?
17238,Leonard,do i get a card?
17245,Leonard,"that tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, i got my money, let’s spend it up…"
17247,Leonard,what are you doing hiding back there?
17250,Leonard,"fine. just get back under your blanket, and i’ll drive you there."
17252,Leonard,"sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. what about hawaii?"
17254,Leonard,hey.
17267,Leonard,what are you gonna do?
17281,Leonard,"all right, we gave it 45 minutes. it’s no longer funny. let’s try something else."
17285,Leonard,what are you doing?
17297,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. just sit down and let him do it."
17299,Leonard,sure. what are you doing?
17308,Leonard,"i don’t know. between you playing chess like bobby fischer and sheldon being okay with you in his spot, i’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
17309,Leonard,"oh, uh, he’s crazy."
17310,Leonard,good. i’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
17323,Leonard,"no, it was called for."
17324,Leonard,"i’m sorry, duh, what?"
17325,Leonard,what’s this about sheldon seeing you naked?
17335,Leonard,that’s what your father used to say?
17356,Leonard,who’s there?
17367,Leonard,"well i told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box."
17375,Leonard,"well, hand it over so i can open it."
17385,Leonard,"raj, you’re our group historian. has sheldon ever begged before?"
17388,Leonard,what are these?
17389,Leonard,it’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. i’d take it and run.
17390,Leonard,give it a second. 
17391,Leonard,"horse, but mostly just for the height. a little bit for the genital girth."
17399,Leonard,"hey, i am a young man in his sexual prime. under the right conditions, i-i-i am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
17406,Leonard,"oh, hey, wil. nice of you to make it out tonight for howard."
17421,Leonard,"folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
17427,Leonard,"when was the last time you were at best buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in russia”?"
17430,Leonard,"before i come in, you should know, i have gas.  "
17432,Leonard,just try it.
17434,Leonard,mm-hmm.
17436,Leonard,"and i promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
17438,Leonard,what about  cookies!
17445,Leonard,"no. hey, do you remember that time when i proposed to you in bed? and you were all, like, what are you doing? that was so funny. so funny."
17446,Leonard,give it a minute. is that a little smile i see there? i should go.
17447,Leonard,"sheldon, knight takes bishop. you all right?"
17448,Leonard,"are you? you left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
17454,Leonard,she’s good.
17456,Leonard,"well, if you had a physical relationship, i’d say propose during sex. turns out that’s a real mood killer."
17461,Leonard,"penny, just, wait. i’ve been thinking about what i said when we were in bed the other night."
17475,Leonard,"what, i can’t propose? i can’t talk to my friends? is there anything else i’m not allowed to do?"
17480,Leonard,i doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
17481,Leonard,"come on, raj, we’re ready to start."
17484,Leonard,"hey, i didn’t say it."
17487,Leonard,this is it.
17491,Leonard,"interesting question. on the one hand, i always thought…"
17495,Leonard,hey.
17497,Leonard,"actually, i’m hanging out with penny. "
17498,Leonard,"sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing raj on your date night with amy?"
17502,Leonard,"good, i’m glad. "
17506,Leonard,"i just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets."
17511,Leonard,i can’t believe i shaved my stomach for this.
17524,Leonard,maybe your tongue is shrinking.
17525,Leonard,i’m starting to get a sense of it. don’t worry. i’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
17543,Leonard,i didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
17550,Leonard,"no, no, no, no."
17552,Leonard,"so, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?"
17559,Leonard,she seems nice.
17561,Leonard,this should be fun.
17562,Leonard,oh!
17565,Leonard,what?
17567,Leonard,"so, alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?"
17580,Leonard,where are we going?
17587,Leonard,nothing with quarks.
17599,Leonard,uh-uh.
17600,Leonard,i’m trying. don’t yell at me.
17606,Leonard,so?
17608,Leonard,snort it down and keep eating!
17622,Leonard,"yeah. it’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. here, i’ll show you. we’ll just put this pencil over here."
17631,Leonard,"hello, boys."
17636,Leonard,sometimes i like to turn this on and pretend i’m the super villain magneto.
17637,Leonard,but what i really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
17656,Leonard,please be good. please be good. uh-huh. uh-huh. okay. she writes like she cooks.
17661,Leonard,"i don’t know what to do. i mean, the paper’s terrible. but if i tell her, she’ll know that i read it and she’ll get really mad."
17669,Leonard,empathetic.
17680,Leonard,"please don’t be upset. i just, i didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."
17683,Leonard,"oh, hey. haven’t heard from you in a couple days. you still mad at me?"
17685,Leonard,i don’t know what to say.
17692,Leonard,"buddy, i think amy might be upset."
17701,Leonard,really?
17703,Leonard,"oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg."
17712,Leonard,"well, maybe you should tell him."
17713,Leonard,"say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. england sucks, you suck, usa number one."
17716,Leonard,what?
17721,Leonard,"if you’re wondering why i’ve been staring through the peephole, i’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to penny’s."
17731,Leonard,i’ll be right back.
17737,Leonard,"no problem, brother. stay frosty.  we’re still dating, right?"
17743,Leonard,"trust me, it doesn’t."
17755,Leonard,they are not.
17759,Leonard,good boy. here’s a cookie.
17761,Leonard,"you get a cookie, too."
17764,Leonard,"sheldon, let it go. it’s not a big deal."
17769,Leonard,"howard, what are you doing?"
17772,Leonard,you’re both acting like lunatics. it’s just a parking spot.
17775,Leonard,"oh. like jaws 4, indiana jones 4, daredevil 1."
17776,Leonard,"penny’s working tonight, i’m in."
17777,Leonard,fun. we know how much you love that.
17779,Leonard,raj is probably right. you should get someone to give you some pointers.
17783,Leonard,it’s not our fault. our dads never did anything like this with us.
17809,Leonard,"seven, six."
17814,Leonard,i don’t know. what’s the difference?
17822,Leonard,it wasn’t amazing. i got a c-minus four years in a row.
17823,Leonard,the drawbridge is lowering.
17825,Leonard,"uh, okay."
17827,Leonard,"okay. so wolowitz and stuart are paralyzed, santa’s dead, and i picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
17832,Leonard,ooh. that’s his take on john wheeler’s quantum foam. that should be great.
17836,Leonard,terrific. something weird happened and i don’t know what to do about it.
17839,Leonard,she knows i have a girlfriend. it’s so weird.
17848,Leonard,oh. it. was.
17856,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did you do?"
17861,Leonard,"no, i’m not happy."
17870,Leonard,how is this my fault?
17873,Leonard,what are you doing here?
17874,Leonard,"oh, would you stop worrying about that?"
17875,Leonard,that’s great.
17878,Leonard,"to my bedroom, so i can take everything off but those glasses. and maybe the boots."
17885,Leonard,"oh, hang on a second. "
17887,Leonard,it is on.
17890,Leonard,"counterpoint, no, it’s not."
17904,Leonard,"please, sheldon, i am so not in the mood."
17909,Leonard,"thanks, but we’ve got it covered."
17910,Leonard,"are you kidding me? after all we’ve been through, i just want to go home."
17912,Leonard,i say we investigate.
17914,Leonard,"sheldon, your food’s getting cold."
17920,Leonard,a thousand dollars on action figures? how can you afford that?
17922,Leonard,yeah. maybe wesley snipes and toucan sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
17930,Leonard,"oh, teacher! me! me!"
17935,Leonard,"what did you do, put this in your tea?"
17936,Leonard,"sheldon, kripke’s not smarter than you. you just got stuck on a wrong path. happened to einstein. he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."
17946,Leonard,why would you say that?
17951,Leonard,"you know what? screw you, sheldon. you are the most annoying person i have ever met."
17953,Leonard,aw. here’s what i think of your roommate agreement.
17961,Leonard,i was thinking here with you.
17966,Leonard,"please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat."
17968,Leonard,"is it? we’re together all the time. financially, it makes great sense. can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?"
17969,Leonard,yeah.
17982,Leonard,hmm?
17988,Leonard,"okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. because i am like a romance ninja. you don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!"
17993,Leonard,from her micro-husband. that is amazing. how long did this take you?
17996,Leonard,want to come to dinner with us?
17997,Leonard,"waugh, romance ninja."
18006,Leonard,that’s the spirit.
18013,Leonard,"um, it did end happy for you. you’re here with me."
18014,Leonard,"okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
18016,Leonard,"this one does, and you’re the reason why."
18023,Leonard,"no. no, no, no, no. but if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me."
18027,Leonard,yes?
18034,Leonard,"yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."
18035,Leonard,lobsters overnight?
18042,Leonard,you know why. the nintendo ds. and the psp. now the gameboy.
18054,Leonard,"guys, please don’t make this a school project where i’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch."
18056,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science."
18065,Leonard,"i never wanted to play the cello. how do you meet girls playing the cello? hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"
18067,Leonard,i had no choice. he kept kicking the back of my seat.
18072,Leonard,"well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. happily married guy throwing dinner parties."
18073,Leonard,trying to paint a picture.
18076,Leonard,"actually, all i did was invite you."
18081,Leonard,"fine, then that."
18082,Leonard,as is the company.
18084,Leonard,same here.
18087,Leonard,"raj, you’re up."
18092,Leonard,bernadette.
18096,Leonard,"yeah, i think so."
18099,Leonard,"oh, my god."
18100,Leonard,"no. i mean, i’ll apply, but i’m not gonna stoop to playing politics."
18109,Leonard,hey.
18112,Leonard,"i’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. my chest is falling into my drawers. i’m not, uh, familiar with this model. how do i make it start?"
18113,Leonard,right. this one might be broken.
18115,Leonard,"well, i’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, i just wanted to say hi and let you know that i’ll be throwing my hat in the ring."
18116,Leonard,yeah.
18117,Leonard,go away.
18118,Leonard,"well, look at that. burned a whole calorie."
18119,Leonard,"oh, if you, if you like banana bread, i’ve got a-a great recipe. the trick is in, in fresh ground, i’ll e-mail it to you."
18120,Leonard,that’s enough cardio for me. i’m just gonna stretch out before i hit the weights.
18125,Leonard,probably not.
18127,Leonard,"wait, sheldon’s going to be there? we all promised we weren’t going to go."
18129,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and i’m not sure how much help you’d be."
18133,Leonard,way to hit ’em with both barrels.
18145,Leonard,"ah, don’t. if they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel."
18153,Leonard,you know what? never mind. we gave it a shot. let’s just see what else is on.
18161,Leonard,"so, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to comic-con?"
18162,Leonard,"the interface is pretty simple. you put your horizontal x coordinate here, vertical y coordinate here. when you’re happy with those, you press this button."
18164,Leonard,you’re kidding. he’s still alive?
18165,Leonard,he was the host of this great… hey!
18168,Leonard,"it would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. i just used awesome wrong, didn’t i?"
18169,Leonard,do you remember his old theme song?
18170,Leonard,you’re kidding.
18178,Leonard,"okay, good night."
18185,Leonard,we just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
18186,Leonard,"that’s too bad. but still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
18196,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice. but relax, sometimes change is good. uh, you were worried about zachary quinto being the new spock, but you wound up liking him."
18201,Leonard,"no, no, no, amy, wait. i know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? it’ll be fun."
18202,Leonard,"what’s the big deal? raj bailed, so we could use some extra players."
18203,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
18213,Leonard,how’s that been working for you?
18219,Leonard,i know what you’re doing. you don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
18220,Leonard,sheldon.
18223,Leonard,"so, listen, do you remember when i said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
18229,Leonard,"uh, he’s not gonna be there. he’s just sending a team to research his theory."
18230,Leonard,"yeah. and i’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and i’d hate to do anything that screws that up."
18232,Leonard,i do have to ask you one favour.
18237,Leonard,"oh. thank you, raj. i’d be honoured."
18245,Leonard,would you just relax?
18249,Leonard,"i love you, too."
18251,Leonard,what is it?
18256,Leonard,"penny? hey, it’s penny. everybody say hi to penny."
18260,Leonard,"no, it’s a drinking game. whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!"
18263,Leonard,"i didn’t tell sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
18268,Leonard,and i’m gonna hit the head. that’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
18271,Leonard,i actually have used those exact words before. in that order.
18278,Leonard,where do you think i would take you?
18279,Leonard,i’m going to work. you can come if you want.
18286,Leonard,stop it.
18297,Leonard,"we did them at princeton, too."
18302,Leonard,you really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
18309,Leonard,do you think penny’s mad at me?
18321,Leonard,why?
18323,Leonard,i can’t believe she would say that about me.
18325,Leonard,almost.
18348,Leonard,"they weren’t boobies, they were muscles. and the make-up was green. i was pretending to be the hulk."
18351,Leonard,"gee, i don’t know. maybe it’s because i was always the subject of her little experiments. did you get to the chapter where she staged the easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long i’d keep looking? the answer, by the way, june."
18357,Leonard,maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
18359,Leonard,i’ll see you later. i gotta go watch a stupid football game with penny.
18375,Leonard,"i am, i’m really proud."
18376,Leonard,"hey, i was just… what is happening?"
18381,Leonard,"oh, please, mommy. no, mommy."
18383,Leonard,"penny, come back. i’m sad for real now."
18386,Leonard,"no, no, i think it’ll be great. maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. giant baby."
18388,Leonard,please let me be there when you tell her that.
18389,Leonard,"please, oh, please, just let me be there."
18390,Leonard,nailed it.
18393,Leonard,that was kind of icy. you two okay?
18395,Leonard,"it’s nine o’clock, where you been?"
18396,Leonard,i did not.
18400,Leonard,doesn’t matter.
18406,Leonard,"and besides, i do romantic things for you all the time. can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?"
18407,Leonard,sex doesn’t count.
18411,Leonard,he’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
18413,Leonard,"nope, it was better before."
18414,Leonard,"holy crap, sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
18417,Leonard,"sheldon, that’s incredible."
18424,Leonard,invite them to live with us.
18435,Leonard,"this is great. it, thank you, it’s, so much."
18451,Leonard,what’s up?
18458,Leonard,"oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes."
18461,Leonard,sheldon just sent me a picture of him and bill nye getting smoothies.
18465,Leonard,"look, i know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. it’s just how he is. but he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
18468,Leonard,"boy, you will not let this go, will you? oh, jeez."
18470,Leonard,he can’t help it. he can’t. he really can’t.
18473,Leonard,that one over there.
18481,Leonard,"okay, okay. i’m gonna show you what’s in the box. but just promise not to flip out."
18484,Leonard,"i mean it, i’m going to."
18487,Leonard,"so, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the dvd, here’s what that means. don’t fixate on it. don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. or nag me through the door while i’m on the toilet."
18491,Leonard,"i’m telling you, try the hanger."
18494,Leonard,no.
18503,Leonard,"no, no, honey, if i take it off, sheldon wins."
18508,Leonard,"listen to me, sheldon. i am not going to lebanon to return super mario brothers the movie."
18518,Leonard,you did?
18519,Leonard,"wait, you went to a chapel?"
18520,Leonard,why? 
18525,Leonard,"well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. you need to get this taken care of."
18526,Leonard,i’m hoping you can get an annulment. it’s just like it never happened.
18527,Leonard,"oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to zack."
18529,Leonard,and we can just put this whole thing behind us.
18538,Leonard,"well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited zack."
18543,Leonard,that is not true.
18546,Leonard,"i’m sorry, too."
18547,Leonard,of course you’re not. people love trained monkeys.
18548,Leonard,"hey, you’re in a good mood."
18550,Leonard,"yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. they faked the results."
18558,Leonard,will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
18561,Leonard,"hey. i just wanted to let you know that i, i posted my findings."
18562,Leonard,"these things happen all the time, sheldon."
18567,Leonard,"oh, relax, she’s in her crate. she can’t get out."
18583,Leonard,and last night.
18586,Leonard,you don’t know that. i’ve been going to the cheesecake factory for years. i could have picked her up.  
18588,Leonard,i’m gonna do it. i’m gonna ask her out.
18589,Leonard,watch me.
18592,Leonard,i will. excuse me.
18597,Leonard,"but, you forget, i did ask you out in real life."
18604,Leonard,that’s enough.
18614,Leonard,"oh, well, it’s you, swamp thing, stephen hawking, spider-man, but, look, you’re in the mix."
18617,Leonard,what happened?
18619,Leonard,that’s amazing.
18621,Leonard,"uh, no reason. i just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination."
18629,Leonard,i’m so proud of you.
18631,Leonard,what’s wrong?
18632,Leonard,"oh, penny, i’m, i’m sorry. "
18635,Leonard,"honey, you only had, like, three lines. that wasn’t gonna happen anyway."
18639,Leonard,right.
18640,Leonard,yes.
18641,Leonard,honestly?
18645,Leonard,"that is not what i said. look, i think you’re really good. i truly do. but this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. i mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
18655,Leonard,"well, i don’t think you called it idiotic."
18672,Leonard,i don’t know.
18685,Leonard,"no, no, no, no. i take it back. don’t say it. just, just hate me, but stay with me. it worked for my parents."
18687,Leonard,yeah.
18688,Leonard,"look, i get it, and i want you to know that i support whatever you want to do."
18695,Leonard,no.
18697,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, stay."
18698,Leonard,i said stay. i’m going to work. do not follow me. 
18702,Leonard,you bought that? great. i got to call her before i forget how i said it. hey.
18710,Leonard,"yes. i thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. if i’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in."
18712,Leonard,no.
18718,Leonard,hey. we’re about to buy tickets for comic-con.
18719,Leonard,"they sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…"
18721,Leonard,not yet. 
18726,Leonard,sunday’s gone.
18727,Leonard,yeah.
18728,Leonard,"sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
18729,Leonard,do what you want. we’re getting scalped tickets.
18732,Leonard,"look, even your friend wil wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
18737,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. you’re gonna get in trouble."
18738,Leonard,"yes. he, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940."
18742,Leonard,"chicken out. we’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
18748,Leonard,good. this is exciting.
18749,Leonard,"yeah. what if we do get caught, who cares? so we get banned from comic-con."
18752,Leonard,we’d be happy to watch cinnamon.
18753,Leonard,"ooh, flowers and chocolates? somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties."
18760,Leonard,"hey, cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
18763,Leonard,"i don’t have a vet. i have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. you’d think i’d have a vet."
18768,Leonard,sorry.
18769,Leonard,we’re really sorry. it was an accident.
18771,Leonard,"maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?"
18775,Leonard,how’s she doing?
18781,Leonard,"no, hang on. hang on. are all those things equal to you?"
18788,Leonard,sorry. how did it go?
18791,Leonard,"hey, penny and i are gonna go shop for a dining room table. you want to come with us?"
18792,Leonard,"seriously? you haven’t used this desk in years. the second i want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?"
18793,Leonard,are you really gonna sit here all day?
18795,Leonard,i’m putting all this stuff in storage. we don’t need any of it.
18799,Leonard,no. sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
18801,Leonard,"well, he is here. so unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing i can do about it."
18805,Leonard,that one? damn right i like that one.
18810,Leonard,that.
18813,Leonard,"you’re too close to it, but amy has had a huge impact on you."
18815,Leonard,"or you’re just a tall, annoying frog."
18820,Leonard,"oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours."
18825,Leonard,why would you do that?
18844,Leonard,"yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. well, it’s true. once i saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up."
18854,Leonard,does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off terminator?
18857,Leonard,"uh, uh, uh, hang on. do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?"
18862,Leonard,like you and sheldon have everything figured out?
18865,Leonard,"of course. well, hey, how about this? whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do."
18866,Leonard,putting it in my phone right now.
18867,Leonard,"all right, i’ll see you guys in 20 years."
18870,Leonard,why not?
18877,Leonard,"well, for starters, i wouldn’t eat the bananas."
18884,Leonard,you have my blessing. go for it.
18887,Leonard,what’s up?
18902,Leonard,"hey, how’s dating two women going?"
18904,Leonard,"oh, yeah. wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?"
18911,Leonard,"hey, i’ve got a good job. i could buy salmon. you don’t know."
18915,Leonard,how you feeling?
18918,Leonard,"after she put you to bed, she went home."
18925,Leonard,hey. how about we bring back anything can happen thursdays?
18934,Leonard,that’s not what i meant.
18936,Leonard,"hey, how about that asian fusion place?"
18937,Leonard,i also love you.
18942,Leonard," ah, it’s penny."
18944,Leonard,"well, penny can be very persuasive. she’s gotten me to do a lot of things i wouldn’t normally do."
18945,Leonard,"yeah, she does."
18947,Leonard,"well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish."
18955,Leonard,"sorry, buddy."
18964,Leonard,i know.
18966,Leonard,sorry.
18975,Leonard,i just thought of one more.
18976,Leonard,i regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
18977,Leonard,yeah.
18992,Leonard,"sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night."
19000,Leonard,"a little, yeah."
19007,Leonard,come on. how can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
19013,Leonard,so i’m like a bran muffin.
19014,Leonard,"no, it’s exactly what you’re saying. i’m the boring thing you’re choosing because i’m good for you."
19015,Leonard,"well, it matters a lot. i don’t want to be a bran muffin. i, i want to be a cinnabon, you know? a strawberry pop-tart. something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes."
19021,Leonard,"so is that it? are, are we engaged?"
19024,Leonard,"oh, i know. this might help."
19025,Leonard,"i’ve had it for a couple years, not important. penny, will you marry me?"
19027,Leonard,how’s your mom holding up?
19038,Leonard,i’m your son. what about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
19040,Leonard,"yes, it would."
19042,Leonard,oh. how’s it going?
19043,Leonard,it’s nice that you called them esteemed.
19051,Leonard,"i don’t know. we just started to think about this. maybe i’ll move in with penny, or maybe she and i’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall."
19061,Leonard,what happened?
19077,Leonard,so a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
19084,Leonard,"i know, but…"
19086,Leonard,okay. good luck.
19087,Leonard,"bye, buddy. sheldon?"
19090,Leonard,he’s okay?
19091,Leonard,"me, too. and he was able to take a sabbatical from…"
19103,Leonard,feel like driving to arizona with me?
19106,Leonard,"come on, you didn’t even try."
19108,Leonard,"yeah, time’s gonna fly by."
19118,Leonard,"yeah. if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?"
19126,Leonard,"this might not be that bad. uh, you like telling people they’re wrong."
19135,Leonard,"you want to know what i think? i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it."
19136,Leonard,might be something to think about.
19137,Leonard,yeah.
19140,Leonard,"okay, next question, for the butterfinger. how long is a galactic yea"
19143,Leonard,right again. 
19153,Leonard,"there isn’t any ranking. and if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it."
19157,Leonard,"yeah, toddlers do that."
19158,Leonard,you believe this guy? he has to be the best at everything.
19161,Leonard,i’m not jealous. i just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
19163,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion."
19164,Leonard,"so, this is accurate?"
19173,Leonard,"yeah, that scares me, too."
19174,Leonard,sometimes.
19176,Leonard,i just want to say one more thing about this. just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
19182,Leonard,"on our quidditch team, he…"
19188,Leonard,"nice to finally meet you, too."
19200,Leonard,"well, do you think when she and i had that conversation, she left people off her list?"
19202,Leonard,will you stay out of this?
19206,Leonard,"mm, the guys and i were thinking about investing in stuart’s comic book store. is that okay?"
19216,Leonard,then we’ll go to a hotel.
19223,Leonard,"guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch tv."
19227,Leonard,"okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. all right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion."
19229,Leonard,how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
19242,Leonard,if only we had one.
19243,Leonard,"okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off."
19244,Leonard,"all right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…"
19248,Leonard,everyone stop. this was a stupid idea. negative reinforcement isn’t working.
19255,Leonard,"yeah, i’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
19264,Leonard,nothing.
19266,Leonard,doesn’t sound that bad.
19270,Leonard,"well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
19271,Leonard,"i know, and i’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean i can’t do something nice. like this."
19274,Leonard,"hey, you got a sec?"
19276,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, hear me out. i know things got a little weird last night."
19278,Leonard,"why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? it’ll be our first money together. we can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever."
19287,Leonard,"well, nailed it."
19292,Leonard,what?
19296,Leonard,"i’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. me neither, leonard. it’s my first time, too."
19297,Leonard,"great timing, food just got here."
19299,Leonard,yes.
19305,Leonard,"i got it, i got it. listen, um, i think there’s been a misunderstanding. see, penny is my fiancée."
19311,Leonard,sure.
19312,Leonard,"oh. well, you know, just being myself, really."
19315,Leonard,"ah, that’s a good question. apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
19316,Leonard,can we talk in private?
19321,Leonard,"no. i got upset. and sheldon made me a beverage, too."
19322,Leonard,"a little, but he’s basically harmless. he’s actually kind of a nice guy."
19323,Leonard,why am i the one that has to get rid of him?
19328,Leonard,"no, because i liked it."
19331,Leonard,i wonder where dr. lorvis is. he’s been gone a while.
19332,Leonard,"uh, guys, we’re locked in here."
19333,Leonard,oh-hom yeah.
19343,Leonard,"let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?"
19355,Leonard,"just relax, it’s a joke. you don’t have hormones."
19361,Leonard,i took a little lady i like to call loneliness.
19364,Leonard,it was before my growth spurt.
19366,Leonard,i would have asked you. in my head. on the way home. while i was having a good cry.
19372,Leonard,yeah. it’s a deviated septum. the surgery to correct it is simple. he’s gonna do it next week.
19381,Leonard,"i told you, there’s nothing to worry about."
19388,Leonard,"i don’t have epilepsy, either."
19393,Leonard,"tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, i’ll think about it."
19395,Leonard,"he was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it."
19406,Leonard,it still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
19411,Leonard,"well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer."
19417,Leonard,any chance you know what it is?
19419,Leonard,"so, was there anything that professor abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?"
19427,Leonard,"mm. i know how you feel. i spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that raj took when he thought no one was looking."
19429,Leonard,yeah. what did they say?
19432,Leonard,why not?
19433,Leonard,"you know the best part of working in the clean room? no allergies. check it out. oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen."
19435,Leonard,"ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. oh, no."
19445,Leonard,"no, admit that you contaminated the clean room."
19449,Leonard,"i can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and slim jim in it."
19450,Leonard,oh. genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a slim jim.
19452,Leonard,"no, no, no. no, raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
19456,Leonard,"you miss the blanket now, don’t you?"
19458,Leonard,"uh, guys, i found an article here that says you can do cpr on birds."
19459,Leonard,"i’m not doing it. you killed him, you do it."
19473,Leonard,yes.
19474,Leonard,no.
19477,Leonard,"you got it, you girls are in charge."
19480,Leonard,i did not force you to go to that.
19483,Leonard,"ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor amy."
19487,Leonard,"uh, i’ve got some bad news. there’s no cell service in here."
19490,Leonard,"okay. and to defend, i roll two sixes. i win."
19495,Leonard,that is not a compromise. a compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
19496,Leonard,what? then. then why don’t you do it?
19510,Leonard,okay.
19513,Leonard,"yeah, it looks great."
19514,Leonard,"well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start."
19517,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
19524,Leonard,what are you doing? it’s time to go.
19525,Leonard,"ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
19536,Leonard,"well, at least listen to it through headphones. i’m trying to sleep. good night."
19537,Leonard,"that can’t be much fun for amy. you know, at work today, he tried his first red bull."
19540,Leonard,here we are.
19547,Leonard,"you know, when you talk like that, i want to take you right here on this table."
19550,Leonard,"okay, well, this is cool. uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…"
19554,Leonard,"i know this isn’t my area, and i could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
19556,Leonard,really?
19561,Leonard,you’re still awake?
19576,Leonard,"let me see, let me see. one calls it insightful and innovative. we’re insightful and innovative."
19579,Leonard,"it’s anonymous, and user name general relativity."
19586,Leonard,read it back one more time.
19591,Leonard,what does that mean?
19594,Leonard,never noticed that about you.
19595,Leonard,"all right, do it. call him. let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished."
19602,Leonard,no problem.
19620,Leonard,i can’t believe they did that.
19627,Leonard,"not right now, sheldon."
19633,Leonard,"i’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. right?"
19637,Leonard,"yeah, sure, that might be fun."
19646,Leonard,i’m putting the city names in the grid now. i’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
19648,Leonard,which book are we looking for?
19650,Leonard,i bet the key’s behind it.
19653,Leonard,"admit it, you’re a little turned on."
19658,Leonard,"well, we’re, we’re very happy for you."
19663,Leonard,"well, ’cause i got it at the dirty store."
19673,Leonard,"uh, th, that’s true. how late did we stay up last night?"
19677,Leonard,because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
19679,Leonard,"i mean, i was on fire. i, i was in the zone, like an athlete."
19683,Leonard,"god, i love you. i love you so much."
19690,Leonard,sheldon.
19691,Leonard,really?
19692,Leonard,"uh, that, that’s not necessary."
19695,Leonard,that’s not helping.
19698,Leonard,"nothing, i’m fine."
19705,Leonard,what happened? did you tell him it was my idea?
19716,Leonard,subtle.
19719,Leonard,"no, it’s okay. we’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. at least i am. howard, what do you think?"
19736,Leonard,yes.
19738,Leonard,it could be.
19749,Leonard,"well, so do i, but they’ll never let us."
19753,Leonard,"um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. i mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for star wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in."
19754,Leonard,and that’s how it’s done.
19757,Leonard,"well, what’s your plan?"
19759,Leonard,"we don’t have an appointment. we, we’re just fans of mr. lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
19762,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe they’ll call imperial officers to take us to a holding cell on the death star.
19763,Leonard,"oh, shut up."
19764,Leonard,"uh-huh, i’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
19769,Leonard,that part was pretty good.
19770,Leonard,you did flop around a lot.
19780,Leonard,this is exciting.
19782,Leonard,"i, i didn’t want to interrupt."
19787,Leonard,you have a new job.
19788,Leonard,i don’t think you can do both.
19791,Leonard,give me back that juice.
19797,Leonard,"like, times two twice?"
19814,Leonard,really?
19815,Leonard,"uh, okay, okay. uh, we, we get it."
19820,Leonard,congratulations.
19834,Leonard,"my god, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him."
19835,Leonard,they zip him up in that bag.
19838,Leonard,"it’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. i mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
19839,Leonard,that’s actually a valid example. animals do deliver messages through scent.
19840,Leonard,yeah. penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
19842,Leonard,all we have to do is rig up a 3-d communication system.
19843,Leonard,i know.
19856,Leonard,wait a minute. sheldon spent a whole day with james earl jones and never told any of us.
19880,Leonard,i don’t think this is gonna work.
19882,Leonard,thank you.
19883,Leonard,"well, i’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. but i have to say, this is very freeing."
19886,Leonard,"my point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. and when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. and for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. thank you and congratulations."
19887,Leonard,so you really think they liked it?
19892,Leonard,"no, we’re kind of taking it slow."
19894,Leonard,"yes, mother."
19895,Leonard,"i change my answer. it, it’s amazing. it’s hot. we can barely keep our hands off each other."
19904,Leonard,"you mean, my hypothesis. i hypothesized it all by myself."
19913,Leonard,"oh, don’t flatter yourself. she likes everybody better than she likes me."
19937,Leonard,i don’t know. because we don’t have a date?
19938,Leonard,"it’s not just the date. we haven’t talked about anything. big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?"
19939,Leonard,is your dad paying for it?
19944,Leonard,shut up.
19947,Leonard,"look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
19950,Leonard,i’m in. let’s do it.
19953,Leonard,i’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
19957,Leonard,"uh, well, there, there’s one thing i feel i should tell you."
19974,Leonard,"so, we’re still getting married?"
19981,Leonard,no. why?
19984,Leonard,"oh, no. seriously?"
19988,Leonard,"sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad."
19991,Leonard,"no, i think it’s because we’re eloping."
19998,Leonard,"oh, don’t worry. they gave me this vibrating coaster."
20007,Leonard,it’s okay. i don’t have to say them.
20008,Leonard,"penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. i like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."
20009,Leonard,i do.
20010,Leonard,"yeah, i’m so glad you guys could watch."
20015,Leonard,everything all right?
20016,Leonard,just tell me.
20021,Leonard,"what do i mean? boy, that’s a toughie."
20023,Leonard,"i wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking"
20029,Leonard,i wouldn’t.
20030,Leonard,"well, i may be a man, but i think i’m the one that screwed up on this one."
20039,Leonard,"you can’t be serious. ‘cause i messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?"
20041,Leonard,"well, trust me, i wish it never happened."
20048,Leonard,"wake up, wake up, wake up."
20055,Leonard,how many times do i have to tell you? i have no interest in this woman.
20057,Leonard,"oh, great, there’s mandy."
20058,Leonard,that’s not helpful.
20072,Leonard,"you know, on some level, i’ve always believed that i don’t deserve a woman like her."
20084,Leonard,"huh? if you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. penny hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?"
20085,Leonard,"yes, please."
20088,Leonard,"sure. hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?"
20091,Leonard,what are you talking about?
20092,Leonard,when do we leave?
20095,Leonard,india.
20107,Leonard,there’s gotta be something else we could try.
20113,Leonard,thank you.
20119,Leonard,it’s harder than i thought.
20124,Leonard,"you heard him, no."
20134,Leonard,"wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
20137,Leonard,that’ll teach her to care about your health.
20138,Leonard,it wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
20143,Leonard,no gym shorts that can be yanked down.
20151,Leonard,"again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. just checked your prostate."
20154,Leonard,"oh, buddy, i get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you."
20158,Leonard,and now the crazy version of what i just said.
20165,Leonard,i know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
20180,Leonard,who is he?
20188,Leonard,"we’re just bending the rules a little. we have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. it’s not like when dr. goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a russian girl in an apartment in van nuys."
20189,Leonard,"sure. so, are we doing this?"
12004,Leonard,"he’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest. "
12007,Leonard,"one across is aegean, eight down is nabakov, twenty-six across is mcm, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across port-au-prince. see, papa doc’s capital idea, that’s port-au-prince. haiti. "
12008,Leonard,"yes. um, is this the high iq sperm bank?"
20203,Leonard,"all right, let’s all just calm down. nobody wants to report anybody."
12014,Leonard,okay.
12017,Leonard,see you.
12020,Leonard,i don’t care. two millimetres? that doesn’t seem right.
12021,Leonard,is that why they sent you to boarding school?
12022,Leonard,new neighbour?
12027,Leonard,"oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
12029,Leonard,hi.
20225,Leonard,"thank you, barry."
20226,Leonard,can you give us a minute?
12036,Leonard,"i think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
12039,Leonard,i’m going to invite her over. we’ll have a nice meal and chat.
12040,Leonard,"well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
12041,Leonard,hi. again.
12047,Leonard,you’re very welcome.
12053,Leonard,just sit somewhere else.
20246,Leonard,i know. i also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
20249,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
20251,Leonard,nirsh.
12061,Leonard,"i think what sheldon’s trying to say, is that sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
12062,Leonard,"wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
12068,Leonard,don’t.
12071,Leonard,our shower works.
20263,Leonard,this is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
12074,Leonard,it’s right down the hall.
20266,Leonard,you just happen to have those in the car?
20269,Leonard,"i know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."
12081,Leonard,"i’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, i’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
12083,Leonard,it’s darth vader shampoo.  luke skywalker’s the conditioner.
12084,Leonard,see what?
12092,Leonard,"save it for your blog, howard."
12093,Leonard,"uh, there it goes, it sticks, i’m sorry."
12095,Leonard,the hair products are sheldon’s.
12099,Leonard,must we?
12100,Leonard,"she asked me to do her a favour, sheldon."
12106,Leonard,"no, sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. there’s two of us and one of him."
20299,Leonard,"come on, don’t be mad. it was a long time ago, and it was an accident."
12108,Leonard,"what did i just…. uh, we’re here to pick up penny’s tv."
12111,Leonard,"come on, we have a combined iq of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
12114,Leonard,"i’m leonard, this is sheldon."
12116,Leonard,what?
12118,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m so sorry i dragged you through this."
20310,Leonard,"huh? some of this? and, since it’s thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?"
20312,Leonard,since when do you hum songs?
12123,Leonard,"well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
12127,Leonard,is thai food okay with you penny?
12132,Leonard,"oh, hi penny."
20325,Leonard,i love you.
20329,Leonard,thank you.
20330,Leonard,"that’s a trick question, right?"
12139,Leonard,"penny, wait."
20332,Leonard,there goes our shot at him living on the roof.
12143,Leonard,"i have 26 hundred comic books in there, i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells."
12155,Leonard,"did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
12160,Leonard,"when the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place."
12161,Leonard,what were you doing in his closet?
12162,Leonard,"oh, hey penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
20352,Leonard,"yeah, he’s on his way. time for bladder check."
12164,Leonard,no.
20353,Leonard,check.
12166,Leonard,it’s a joke.
20360,Leonard,hey.
20363,Leonard,i’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. what would i say is wrong with me?
12174,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to get out of here."
12176,Leonard,that’s ridiculous. 
20372,Leonard,"no, no, say it. sing it. rent a plane, write it in the sky."
12181,Leonard,you think?
12182,Leonard,"you know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
20376,Leonard,hi.
12186,Leonard,how did she know it was us?
20379,Leonard,"all right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, i told her about you and your drug. she said she’d be happy to meet you."
20382,Leonard,hey.
12194,Leonard,no.
20388,Leonard,what is happening?
12197,Leonard,oh.
12201,Leonard,"one package, phillips head screws."
20395,Leonard,i wish that all the time. usually before i blow out birthday candles.
12208,Leonard,"oh, i’ve got it. how about if we replace panels a, b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium. "
12209,Leonard,meet back here in an hour?
12210,Leonard,got it. .
20402,Leonard,this weekend.
12214,Leonard,"that’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, i’ll swat him off."
12215,Leonard,"raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
20407,Leonard,nope.
20409,Leonard,"ah, so like every other m. night shyamalan movie i’ve seen, you spoil it in advance."
12228,Leonard,what is wrong with you?
20420,Leonard,what are you doing?
20423,Leonard,"if i’m going to jail, i’m killing him, not breaking his thumb."
12236,Leonard,hello lesley.
12237,Leonard,lesley i would like to propose an experiment.
20428,Leonard,"oh, that’s nice. most people her age don’t embrace technology."
20431,Leonard,"hi. so nice to finally meet you. let me take this for you, meemaw."
20433,Leonard,that’s my best friend.
12244,Leonard,can you define the parameters of the kiss?
20437,Leonard,just get in here.
20440,Leonard,"penny and i have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no."
20443,Leonard,not really.
12252,Leonard,"i’ve been thinking about names, i’m kind of torn between einstein, newton and sergeant fuzzyboots. "
12253,Leonard,"maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat."
12255,Leonard,"you’re right. i didn’t ask her out, i should ask her out."
12258,Leonard,"there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner i mean supper."
20451,Leonard,a lot of attitude from the woman who thought mc squared was a rapper.
20456,Leonard,i don’t know if i’m comfortable with that.
12269,Leonard,can you tell i’m perspiring a little?
20461,Leonard,is that a big deal?
20463,Leonard,"mm, you watched the bachelor a lot."
20464,Leonard,"no, they’re not."
12273,Leonard,"no reason. oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea. "
12278,Leonard,"if i could calm down i wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack."
12282,Leonard,"oh, who am i kidding, i can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
12286,Leonard,give me the phone. 
12288,Leonard,"stop asking me all these questions, i need to take another shower."
12289,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no. turns out that raj and howard had to work, and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet. "
20480,Leonard,what’s going on?
20482,Leonard,"why oh, no?"
20484,Leonard,you’re the other baby.
20485,Leonard,would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
20487,Leonard,it’ll be fine. people have kids every day. you’ll figure this out.
12296,Leonard,"no,  you were saying, but…"
20488,Leonard,"hey, you know what we should do?"
12299,Leonard,"i’m not sure that i do. um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer."
20493,Leonard,"uh, these are strong, you should slow down."
12302,Leonard,physics. .
12306,Leonard,"no, no, i’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding."
12308,Leonard,"sorry about your car, by the way."
12309,Leonard,the poor guy on the bike. i had a nice time.
12313,Leonard,awesome!
12316,Leonard,"sounds like a breakthrough, should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? "
20510,Leonard,i think we’d make amazing parents.
20512,Leonard,"well, where’s that information been this whole time?"
12325,Leonard,what.  howard brought a date?
20517,Leonard,maybe we could get batman to actually show up.
12327,Leonard,morning
20530,Leonard,"okay, i’d better go in there and talk to him."
12340,Leonard,right… i didn’t….
20534,Leonard,hey.
20535,Leonard,leslie. i can’t remember the last time we talked. so much has changed.
12344,Leonard,"really, when was the last time you left the house."
20538,Leonard,"seriously, barry, stop."
20541,Leonard,"uh, professor hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together."
12351,Leonard,sounds like a wise man.
12352,Leonard,a death ray?
20544,Leonard,so what happens next?
20546,Leonard,"if we do, i am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy."
20549,Leonard,"sorry, but we can’t sign this."
12358,Leonard,that narrows it down. 
12359,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, orcs are magic, superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk."
20558,Leonard,"guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? howard’s invention, sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. which i’m sure penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now."
12367,Leonard,what happened to elliot wong?
12368,Leonard,"yeah, sure, why not."
12375,Leonard,how so?
20567,Leonard,that beats the onesie i was gonna get them from baby gap.
20568,Leonard,this is cool. when was the last time you and i built something together?
12379,Leonard,"uh, sure, why not. "
20571,Leonard,"soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make."
20573,Leonard,"you know what, this part isn’t that technical. you actually could."
20575,Leonard,"after you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."
12386,Leonard,"well, i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so i guess there’s no point in bringing it up. "
12387,Leonard,"no. no, there’s nothing going on between penny and me."
12389,Leonard,"yeah, yeah it is good. did you want to start now?"
20585,Leonard,what about the girls?
12396,Leonard,pretty good. 
12397,Leonard,"pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
20588,Leonard,i mean without lying.
20592,Leonard,"hey, you were right."
12401,Leonard,"you know what, i’m being ridiculous. but who cares what penny thinks, lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent."
20596,Leonard,hey.
12408,Leonard,so anyway  hello.
20602,Leonard,because he’s hitting on you?
20603,Leonard,"oh, good."
20605,Leonard,"okay, one sec."
12414,Leonard,you want to make plans for new years.
20615,Leonard,you’ll wish it would kill you.
12425,Leonard,"okay then. you know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. . "
12430,Leonard,hello penny.
20623,Leonard,"okay, i’ll go. never have i ever been arrested."
20627,Leonard,never should’ve told you about alvin and the chipmunks.
20634,Leonard,"no, i do, and that’s why i hid it."
20637,Leonard,really? why?
12448,Leonard,"actually, penny, he’s rob…"
12451,Leonard,we’re socialising. meeting new people. 
20647,Leonard,"no, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s batman, but if man-man dresses as a bat, that’s batman-man."
20655,Leonard,"oh, you know what? i’m not going."
12464,Leonard,because i’m frodo.
12466,Leonard,that’s penny’s ex-boyfriend.
12472,Leonard,"yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, sheldon, you and i are the alpha males. we shouldn’t have to back down. "
20669,Leonard,and i’d think you’d understand why i’m annoyed.
20673,Leonard,"oh, good, go. you know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, i read the books, don’t get too fond of this character."
12484,Leonard,"yeah, no, i’m fine. it’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…."
20677,Leonard,stuart.
12489,Leonard,i’m fine. 
12490,Leonard,it’s not your fault.
20688,Leonard,she defends him all the time.
12501,Leonard,"that’s right, you saw what you saw. that’s how we roll in the shire. "
12504,Leonard,sure. what’s going on.
12505,Leonard,"so, if you don’t like this christie, why are you letting her stay? "
12511,Leonard,"penny, you are on fire."
12520,Leonard,"no, take the couch, or my bed, i just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. "
12521,Leonard,"let me guess, you have a problem with this."
20713,Leonard,"good, it’s not just me."
12523,Leonard,"your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? "
12524,Leonard,so? 
12530,Leonard,"fyi, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the uv light. "
12531,Leonard,"well, sleep tight."
12532,Leonard,"funny expression, sleep tight. it refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight. "
12533,Leonard,what are you doing? 
20722,Leonard,i smell nothing.
20728,Leonard,and i doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
12538,Leonard,leonard. 
12540,Leonard,for one thing you live with your mother.
20732,Leonard,would you like a glass of wine?
20736,Leonard,how?
20737,Leonard,very funny.
20744,Leonard,does it bother you?
12553,Leonard,"yeah, we can always divide soup."
20749,Leonard,"oh, hey, penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?"
12565,Leonard,well then start throwing grenades.
12569,Leonard,"no, never mind, alright, go. "
20763,Leonard,you think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
20766,Leonard,he’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
20769,Leonard,"we’d still get in, but first i’d hit you over the head with his stick chair."
12579,Leonard,what? 
20773,Leonard,"okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here."
20775,Leonard,you did everything you could.
20776,Leonard,"now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. that’s all anyone could ask."
20781,Leonard,"did she think you were choking or… i’m sorry, that’s great. thank you for spending time with her."
12595,Leonard,what happened?
20787,Leonard,i’d love it if my dad could come.
12597,Leonard,i’m pretty sure her name’s lalita.
20789,Leonard,"sorry, but i don’t think i need your permission to have my father at my wedding."
20794,Leonard,"hey, i, i know things are a little rough with you and mom, but i’m really glad you’re here."
20795,Leonard,penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
20796,Leonard,"thanks, dad."
20798,Leonard,"dad, you remember sheldon."
12608,Leonard,you didn’t?
20802,Leonard,"all right, you two, don’t start. penny and i are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. can you please not ruin it?"
20803,Leonard,mom.
20808,Leonard,hey.
12619,Leonard,are there any other honours i’ve gotten that i don’t know about? did ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it?
12620,Leonard,"shut up, howard. sheldon, we have to do this."
20815,Leonard,what is happening there?
12628,Leonard,ah!
12632,Leonard,oh.
12633,Leonard,"oh, that’s the bottled city of kandor. "
12635,Leonard,it’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
20827,Leonard,i’m glad you decided to stay. it’s gonna be special for penny and me to share this with you.
12639,Leonard,"i know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
20838,Leonard,"oh, you, too. hey, everyone, this is my mother, beverley."
12648,Leonard,great.
20841,Leonard,thank you.
20843,Leonard,that’s okay. i can make it over.
12652,Leonard,"i don’t know, i wasn’t choosing my…"
12653,Leonard,"no, no not at all. a little bit. "
12655,Leonard,let’s go.
20852,Leonard,that’s not a bad idea.
20855,Leonard,hi. 
12665,Leonard,you are not isaac newton.
20858,Leonard,"‘cause when you talk, it enrages people."
20863,Leonard,"exactly. yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
12673,Leonard,you were trying to blow up my head.
20868,Leonard,"oh, thanks, man. "
20869,Leonard,"well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
20870,Leonard,"oh, looks like it."
12683,Leonard,"alright, oh wait, they use it to in…"
20879,Leonard,"guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. now, can you please try"
12693,Leonard,see you.  
12697,Leonard,that’s very true. 
12698,Leonard,what?
12699,Leonard,it’s two o’clock in the morning
12704,Leonard,yes.
20900,Leonard,your problem.
12721,Leonard,we’re going to long beach?
12722,Leonard,"oh, come on!"
20913,Leonard,that stinks. how long are you out of the apartment?
20919,Leonard,"okay. star trek, the original series, the enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
20920,Leonard,"and you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
12730,Leonard,"howard, i’m sorry… we’re… we’re"
20922,Leonard,just nod and smile. he’s almost gone.
12734,Leonard,"oh, another hug, thank you."
20927,Leonard,you enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
20929,Leonard,"i’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together."
12738,Leonard,"wait, are we really going to long beach? "
12739,Leonard,"let it go, sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. "
12740,Leonard,"what are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over. "
20930,Leonard,good night.
20935,Leonard,"oh, don’t worry. once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
20936,Leonard,i’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
20938,Leonard,you were right. 
12747,Leonard,sheldon?
20945,Leonard,won’t.
20946,Leonard,don’t.
12756,Leonard,how long is he going to stay here.
12761,Leonard,how was your family?
20956,Leonard,"and you’re starting out with sheldon cooper. that’s like getting your first pet and having it be, i don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
20959,Leonard,"no, don’t do that."
12768,Leonard,with lime jello?
12771,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting? "
12773,Leonard,what for? 
12775,Leonard,"you had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? "
20968,Leonard,how you guys doing?
20972,Leonard,‭yeah. it’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad d-list celebrities to appear. why?
20973,Leonard,that’s awesome. is this for serial ape-ist?
12782,Leonard,"alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. "
20974,Leonard,when is it?
20986,Leonard,oh. you think he’s your first autograph?
12803,Leonard,"what do you see, what do you see."
20995,Leonard,i’m her husband.
20998,Leonard,like a river carves a canyon.
21000,Leonard,and that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
12809,Leonard,"well, how do i carry it if i’m on my hands and knees?"
21001,Leonard,"the third time i did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
12813,Leonard,it wasn’t on? 
21006,Leonard,what do you mean?
12818,Leonard,"well, i had to, you see what he’s like. "
21011,Leonard,i wouldn’t worry about it. she’s probably just distracted by work.
21014,Leonard,yes.
21017,Leonard,"well, of course not."
21019,Leonard,are you kidding me?
21020,Leonard,"superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone."
21022,Leonard,khoo-vakh! she took my where’s waldo.
21024,Leonard,"eventually, i guess. although, i am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
21025,Leonard,"oh, my god, i’m going blind."
21026,Leonard,yeah?
21029,Leonard,"fine, i told sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now i’m all confused."
21031,Leonard,"bernadette told howard, howard told me, plus, i can see all my stuff is gone."
12840,Leonard,"it’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it? "
12842,Leonard,"just eat, sheldon, you’ll feel better. "
12850,Leonard,yes.
12851,Leonard,it would blow up.
21042,Leonard,i really do.
21048,Leonard,wow.
12857,Leonard,like what? he’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. 
21050,Leonard,"i love you, too."
21054,Leonard,"oh, so she’s an astronomer?"
12863,Leonard,it’s take your daughter to work day. 
21057,Leonard,why does he need a baby? he’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
21060,Leonard,"well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two."
21062,Leonard,that is unbelievable. good for bert.
12871,Leonard,"i can’t just go up and talk to her. howard, you talk to her. "
21064,Leonard,how much money did he win?
12873,Leonard,"okay, that was uncalled for."
12875,Leonard,"yeah, mission accomplished. "
12887,Leonard,the ladies?
21079,Leonard,"do it. visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
12895,Leonard,i knew that too.
12896,Leonard,just ask another one.
21090,Leonard,"excuse me, i have to go take some pictures."
12899,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
12900,Leonard,"can it wait, i need to talk to you."
21091,Leonard,"it’s not hard. just picture the three stooges, and then take away two stooges."
21093,Leonard,"yeah. i loved it. love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
21096,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
21105,Leonard,"keep the clock, sheldon."
21112,Leonard,"yeah, i like this one."
12922,Leonard,"that’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, i’d like to get on with my question now."
21119,Leonard,"sheldon, i know what you did, now change the password back."
12929,Leonard,"no, it stands for perpetual motion squad. "
21123,Leonard,separating my delicates.
21129,Leonard,and just leave him here alone?
21132,Leonard,"sheldon, get out here."
12941,Leonard,i know someone who would disagree.
21134,Leonard,because you were being selfish.
12943,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m sorry.  i’m not! "
12944,Leonard,what are you doing?
12946,Leonard,how do you know these things?
12947,Leonard,"wait, i don’t think it’s shatner."
21141,Leonard,good?
21142,Leonard,"well, i’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there."
12951,Leonard,uh-huh.
21150,Leonard,hang on. i’m counting. it’s okay.
21154,Leonard,"it’s not just howard and bernadette. i mean, look how far we’ve all come."
21156,Leonard,"sheldon, howard and i are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
12968,Leonard,"it’s… you know, time machine. "
12974,Leonard,that sounds fair.
12975,Leonard,"sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. now out of the way so i can sit in my time machine.  okay, i am setting the dials for march 10th, 1876. "
21172,Leonard,it might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
21176,Leonard,stupid idea.
21177,Leonard,"for the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
12987,Leonard,what was your first clue?
12988,Leonard,yes i’m upset. 
12989,Leonard,"yeah, good for you. "
21183,Leonard,"if i need a break, i’ll ask for a break."
12992,Leonard,thanks for pointing it out.
12996,Leonard,no problem. 
12997,Leonard,some things are more important than toys. 
21190,Leonard,"well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice."
12999,Leonard,i’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. 
21192,Leonard,and this wine is why.
13001,Leonard,"terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
21193,Leonard,i made your favourite. pizza bagels.
21195,Leonard,"well, you know, it’s easy to take each other for granted and i never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. it’s peaceful and deep. your soul is, it’s like a secret that i could never keep."
13004,Leonard,"look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
21196,Leonard,i quoted your favourite nsync song.
13010,Leonard,"forget it guys, if i sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
13013,Leonard,"okay. i did not want to do this but, i have here the rare mint condition production error star trek: the next generation geordi laforge, without his visor in the original packaging. if you do not get out of my way, i will open it. "
13016,Leonard,yeah.
13020,Leonard,"i’m glad you agree. i hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. "
21214,Leonard,mm-hmm.
21222,Leonard,unsweetened almond…
21223,Leonard,"sorry, thank you."
13036,Leonard,those are not mine.
13038,Leonard,i wasn’t staring! 
21231,Leonard,i came here to apologize.
13042,Leonard,we don’t entertain much. 
13050,Leonard,"sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
13052,Leonard,"alright, noted. but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister. "
13054,Leonard,whatever. you have to do something about it.
21247,Leonard,that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
13057,Leonard,uh-huh. 
21249,Leonard,i don’t like trains. you like trains.
21250,Leonard,"well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
13060,Leonard,say what?
21254,Leonard,"huh. is that a good idea? i mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
13064,Leonard,sit down.
13065,Leonard,"if we’re going to fight over missy, let’s do it the right way. the honourable way."
21256,Leonard,hmm. who knows? that’s exciting. i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.
13067,Leonard,"stay down, bitch. yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
13075,Leonard,"forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is saturday? "
21274,Leonard,that was six years ago. i’m talking about tonight.
21276,Leonard,"mm, penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for randall to visit."
13085,Leonard,fine. 
21280,Leonard,we can’t. he was already fixed when i found him at the shelter.
13089,Leonard,not if you believe his doctors. 
21285,Leonard,"fine, go for a little walk."
21286,Leonard,just keep walking.
13095,Leonard,now?
21287,Leonard,at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
21298,Leonard,"oh, nothing. just some math we don’t need."
13108,Leonard,"oh, it’s okay."
13109,Leonard,"hey penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?"
13114,Leonard,"penny, are you okay?"
13118,Leonard,"you know what, i’m going to go back and try talking to her again."
21310,Leonard,"yeah, i know. that’s not even a math symbol. that’s just charlie brown’s hair."
13122,Leonard,"i’m her friend, i’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
21315,Leonard,"oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
21316,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. you can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff."
21317,Leonard,"and instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
21318,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
13135,Leonard,maybe a little.
13138,Leonard,"what is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal. "
13139,Leonard,i’m pretty sure i never said that. 
21331,Leonard,"i’m trying, but i’m judging."
13143,Leonard,just roll the dice. 
13144,Leonard,"she was mad at him. she was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and i walked over there and i fixed it!"
21337,Leonard,yeah.
21340,Leonard,hey.
13150,Leonard,"oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig ipod… yeah, no, how could he do that. "
13152,Leonard,what about me?
13161,Leonard,i don’t think i can go out with her tonight. 
13162,Leonard,other people would say “why not?” 
13163,Leonard,i’m going to talk anyway.
21354,Leonard,"every hotel is booked. but, yeah, see this space here between sheldon’s feet and my head? that’s where you go."
21357,Leonard,"hey, i was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be hulk and she-hulk. or we could paint ourselves blue and go as nightcrawler and mystique."
21366,Leonard,"sure, or you can."
21374,Leonard,why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?
21378,Leonard,"you know what? i’ve gone 12 times. maybe i’ll sit out this year, too."
13187,Leonard,"bite me. sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
21380,Leonard,"oh, how about we compromise and go on the small world ride at disneyland?"
13192,Leonard,"okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. we went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could i have possibly gone wrong. "
13194,Leonard,"look, everything went fine. i didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. the woman across the hall is into me. "
13197,Leonard,you could be batman?
13200,Leonard,what about saturday?
13202,Leonard,no i didn’t.
13203,Leonard,what’s going on with you?
21394,Leonard,i don’t know. yours looks like he has worms.
21395,Leonard,hey. 
13206,Leonard,good day? 
21396,Leonard,perfect timing. food’s ready.
21397,Leonard,"you didn’t do anything, it’s sheldon. that’d make a nice needlepoint pillow."
13209,Leonard,i’m still confused.
21399,Leonard,why are you saying we have marital problems? we don’t have marital problems.
21402,Leonard,we do seem to keep finding room mates.
13213,Leonard,no. 
13216,Leonard,where are you gonna live? 
21408,Leonard,"just one second. help, cinnamon’s loose in the building."
21409,Leonard,"you are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
13219,Leonard,what’s with him?
13220,Leonard,i still don’t know why you left.
13223,Leonard,what secret. tell me the secret. 
21415,Leonard,he does raise an interesting point.
21417,Leonard,who’s paul?
13235,Leonard,absolutely.  oh bite me! 
21427,Leonard,"oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. isn’t that right, halley?"
21429,Leonard,"a little, until i saw them in matching tops."
13241,Leonard,"can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
13246,Leonard,of course. out of respect.
21444,Leonard,"yeah, why?"
21446,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
13259,Leonard,are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
13262,Leonard,"oh, i’m flattered. so, how do you suggest we proceed?"
13264,Leonard,"thank you, that’s very thoughtful."
21456,Leonard,how could you lose that?
13268,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s a date, i have a date coming over."
21464,Leonard,so howard back monday?
21466,Leonard,"so, sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."
21467,Leonard,"hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. why don’t the two of you join us?"
13281,Leonard,"listen, i’m sorry about all of sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
21474,Leonard,"mm, just down there."
13283,Leonard,"no problem, i’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. so i guess i’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening."
21475,Leonard,and we lived happily ever after. 
21476,Leonard,o-o-o-o-oh.
13286,Leonard,"okay, well, goodnight. "
21489,Leonard,"mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
21491,Leonard,you’re gonna have to be more specific.
21497,Leonard,"honestly? it’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
13307,Leonard,"hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water."
13308,Leonard,beats me. they were playing all last night too.
21502,Leonard,"oh, i know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny."
13311,Leonard,why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
13312,Leonard,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
13314,Leonard,i’ll go talk to her.
21512,Leonard,so you think it’s fine if she works for zack?
21514,Leonard,thank you.
13326,Leonard,"excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
13327,Leonard,sheldon…
13332,Leonard,this is bad.
13333,Leonard,"really, really bad."
21524,Leonard,not if i want to be doing this later.
13336,Leonard,who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
21537,Leonard,"yeah, what’s going on with you guys?"
13347,Leonard,"and when we go in there, let’s show raj that we’re happy for him."
21540,Leonard,"ah, we’ll miss you, too."
21541,Leonard,i’m trying. this is the best i can do. what are you doing?
13351,Leonard,celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. right sheldon?  
13352,Leonard,dr gablehauser.
21546,Leonard,"all right, let me start again. uh, you and amy…"
13358,Leonard,you just got him this afternoon.
21550,Leonard,shut up.
21559,Leonard,"ah, did you see that? she just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. what is happening?"
21560,Leonard,"penny laid into me, too. apparently, i’m overly fixated on premium swiss chocolate bars."
21563,Leonard,like what?
21566,Leonard,"yeah, she’s definitely going after sheldon."
13376,Leonard,yes.
21577,Leonard,"you don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… god, that’s a good song. "
21579,Leonard,"hey, i just ran into penny, she seemed upset about something."
13393,Leonard,"sheldon, i was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my x-ray diffraction experiment."
13396,Leonard,and?
21590,Leonard,"oh hey penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
21600,Leonard,hey! 
13413,Leonard,"okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
21605,Leonard,two seats right there. 
21609,Leonard,hi sheldon.
21612,Leonard,hoo-boy.
13423,Leonard,"so wait,you’re just gonna give up?"
13429,Leonard,it’s never safe.
13431,Leonard,"well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings."
13438,Leonard,"if you don’t do this, i won’t take you to the comic book store."
13444,Leonard,"hey, ramona. come on in."
13447,Leonard,"oh, yeah. no, we were just going."
21642,Leonard,"yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
13451,Leonard,"honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
21647,Leonard,"you’re insane, you know that?!"
21648,Leonard,"hey, howard, what’s up?"
13461,Leonard,"ah, hey leslie."
13468,Leonard,sheldon?  what are you doing?!
21663,Leonard,"i can’t believe you think he only wears it on halloween. open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching."
21665,Leonard,too casual?
13475,Leonard,what are you talking about?
21667,Leonard,‘sup?
13477,Leonard,good night.
21670,Leonard,"i’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
13484,Leonard,potl.
13491,Leonard,did i miss anything? did they kick giselle off?
13497,Leonard,yes.
21691,Leonard,u-u-u-uh!
13500,Leonard,no.
13501,Leonard,yes.
21697,Leonard,yeah.
13508,Leonard,"no, no, no,  no, i don’t think that’s where it was."
13512,Leonard,"listen, don’t worry. i’ll talk to him."
13522,Leonard,"well, actually, technically, you did do it."
21720,Leonard,yeah.
21722,Leonard,dr. cooper?
21725,Leonard,"uh, radon?"
21728,Leonard,"i don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
21729,Leonard,there’s three?
13543,Leonard,"ahoy, matey."
21735,Leonard,yes.
13546,Leonard,"well, i want to watch it now."
13547,Leonard,watch whatever you want.
21739,Leonard,"come on, i just asked."
21744,Leonard,"i, i’m sorry, uh, in the morning. around eight."
13560,Leonard,ooh. cool.
21754,Leonard,i’m sure he’ll go away.
13563,Leonard,"no, wait! if anyone asks you where i went, you don’t know."
21759,Leonard,"yeah, not a good idea."
13568,Leonard,i don’t know. just tell them i went to the office.
13569,Leonard,no.
21760,Leonard,"oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. howard and raj helped me bring it up."
21764,Leonard,what am i doing in your spam folder?
21771,Leonard,that your dad?
13581,Leonard,"that’s a good idea. there’s a bed in there, and i’m very, very, very pro-bed."
21775,Leonard,"excuse me, but i’ve been working on this a long time. trust me, it’ll work."
21777,Leonard,"well, i’ve adjusted the formula."
13586,Leonard, thank you.
21778,Leonard,"okay, i’ve had it with you. you might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. and when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh."
13589,Leonard,"exactly. thank you. do me a favour, tell koothrappali that next time you see him."
21781,Leonard,what’d you do that for? i had plenty of time. 
13593,Leonard,yeah.
13596,Leonard,so why’d you ask?
13602,Leonard,"yeah, but i don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…"
13604,Leonard,hmm. lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
13605,Leonard,"howard, howard, look at this."
13607,Leonard,i stand corrected.
13611,Leonard,"okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?"
13615,Leonard,what invitation?
13622,Leonard,the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
13636,Leonard,"no, i’m not. i’m bleeding."
13638,Leonard,"oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. "
13644,Leonard,"thank you, dr. cooper."
13646,Leonard,sure. .
13654,Leonard,"me, too."
13662,Leonard,we’re not living together.
13664,Leonard,"wait, i only initialed it because i never thought it would happen! i initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case i get superpowers."
13671,Leonard,"look, i’m just saying, um, penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. in fact, some mornings i’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with mrs. vartabedian."
13672,Leonard,"she doesn’t like you. um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and i have to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on, so…"
13673,Leonard,"okay, bye-bye."
13674,Leonard,why do i feel like i’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
13676,Leonard,we’re not living together.
13679,Leonard,we’re not living together.
13685,Leonard,"actually, i think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend."
13697,Leonard,no that doesn’t sound right either.
13699,Leonard,you have a really good grasp on this. maybe you could talk to her?
13700,Leonard,"no, but that’s okay. i’ll go talk to her. want to come with?"
13709,Leonard,"okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
13714,Leonard,hey.
13717,Leonard,"well, um, on one level, really, really well."
13720,Leonard,"um, little bit.  what?"
13722,Leonard,really?
13733,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. we’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and i don’t even know what a duvet is but i’m pretty sure if i did i wouldn’t want one, but every time i talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
13734,Leonard,isn’t that kind of cowardly?
13735,Leonard,sold. “i think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” there. it’s done.
13742,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
13753,Leonard,"he’s funny, too. he does this hysterical impersonation of stephen hawking having phone sex. what are you wearing? that’s not, he does it better. anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so i’m gonna go practice my situps."
13756,Leonard,thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
13774,Leonard,"yes, please shut up. so, um, dave, don’t you think you and i should get back to the lab? you know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself."
13787,Leonard,smooth.
13789,Leonard,"by the way, my leg is killing me. thanks for asking."
13796,Leonard,maybe we should start small.
13816,Leonard,he’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? the guy is devastated.
13818,Leonard,"you know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing bruce banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
13822,Leonard,i came home with no pants.
13825,Leonard,"oh, my god. that’s kripke’s robot?"
13830,Leonard,nice little bot you’ve got here.
13833,Leonard,"i just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
13843,Leonard,good luck getting time on it. the only people he lets use it are his friends.
13855,Leonard,hold on. i put some real work into that!
13864,Leonard,why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
13876,Leonard,in the bathroom.
13877,Leonard,what’s that?
13878,Leonard,can i whistle?
13882,Leonard,"we’ve got to be missing something. let’s start again. the movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45."
13887,Leonard,interesting.
13890,Leonard,"hey, penny. how was work?"
13906,Leonard,"a little mood lighting, huh?"
13908,Leonard,"fourteen dollars, huh?"
13909,Leonard,"back in the pocket it goes. look, you do understand that sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. it’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
13922,Leonard,well what are you gonna do?
13928,Leonard,"hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
13932,Leonard,i could use some help.
13935,Leonard,i’m not afraid of him.
13936,Leonard,"excuse me. when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor, didn’t samwise, pippin and merry go with him?"
13943,Leonard,"hi, kurt."
13948,Leonard,"feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. um, i just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
13953,Leonard,hey.
13956,Leonard,"hey, i know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
13957,Leonard,really? did he say why?
13958,Leonard,that’s it? did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
13966,Leonard,"good to see you, mother."
13972,Leonard,yes.
13977,Leonard,"swell. if you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the powerpoint presentation."
13982,Leonard,"yeah i, i thought you guys might hit it off."
13986,Leonard,"boy, you suck."
13987,Leonard,why are you doing this?
13990,Leonard,howard lives with his mother and raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. go.
13996,Leonard,you got alcohol?
14002,Leonard,it’s too late for me. my head is her summer house.
14004,Leonard,did you get the part?
14007,Leonard,"yeah. i got a dressmaker’s mannequin, i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
14009,Leonard,my father used to borrow it.
14020,Leonard,morning.
14027,Leonard,"you know what baffles me, sheldon?"
14029,Leonard,"yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!"
14036,Leonard,calm down. we’ll figure it out.
14038,Leonard,don’t sit in his spot.
14041,Leonard,yeah. you ought to come out with us sometime.
14046,Leonard,we could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
14048,Leonard,it’s too small and too perfect.
14050,Leonard,sheldon! how was the comic book store?
14052,Leonard,isn’t that terrific? he is such a good friend. you know what the best thing about friends is?
14053,Leonard,"no, no, friends forgive the little things."
14056,Leonard,"i don’t know what you’re talking about. oh, that. penny did that."
14064,Leonard,get out.
14066,Leonard,i don’t know. texas?
14068,Leonard,"nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him."
14073,Leonard,"yeah, well, before they went out of business, i bought 4,000 containers. i keep them in the trunk of my car."
14078,Leonard,penny is an amazing shot. i think we have a real chance to win this week.
14088,Leonard,you’ve heard of him?
14104,Leonard,my money’s on tuck and roll.
14119,Leonard,"boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  but look, penny’s home. why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
14120,Leonard,so?
14128,Leonard,"i don’t know. some sort of placebo effect, i guess."
14129,Leonard,"hey, penny. it’s leonard."
14138,Leonard,why?
14141,Leonard,cheeseburger. i get a cheeseburger.
14146,Leonard,what if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-rtv to provide a better mounting surface?
14150,Leonard,"hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
14151,Leonard,"uh, hey, it’s your business. do whatever you want."
14154,Leonard,not you. i wasn’t asking you. penny?
14155,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
14158,Leonard,"uh-huh. look. mrs. fiona fondell from huntsville, alabama has ordered two."
14166,Leonard,"sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
14168,Leonard,bam.
14179,Leonard,why would you just say something like that?
14181,Leonard,why are you making it worse?
14184,Leonard,"raj, help me out here."
14185,Leonard,"stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. what are you doing?"
14188,Leonard,hello.
14194,Leonard,"hey, penny. this is alicia, our new neighbour."
14198,Leonard,"alicia is an actress, just like you."
14201,Leonard,"it’s a little insulting, don’t you think?"
14204,Leonard,"gee, penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
14206,Leonard,what’s wrong?
14207,Leonard,"oh, i’d watch that."
14229,Leonard,"ah, yeah, that’s captain sweatpants. he doesn’t really help the point i’m trying to make."
14234,Leonard,apparently so.
14237,Leonard,"sure, why not?"
14242,Leonard,"and you guys are going together, great…"
14251,Leonard,i think blinky’s cute.
14258,Leonard,fine. i’ll sit here. you take flight and hunt.
14260,Leonard,yes
14264,Leonard,yes
14269,Leonard,we were up to you.
14271,Leonard,"sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
14272,Leonard,"okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. do you want to go to the comic book store? maybe go see a movie?"
14285,Leonard,"yeah, i really need to talk to you."
14294,Leonard,"yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…"
14300,Leonard,"hey, how’s it going."
14301,Leonard,yes.
14311,Leonard,"uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. you know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
14315,Leonard,i’m listening.
14317,Leonard,"good, good. you?"
14318,Leonard,sure.
14324,Leonard,"well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort."
14329,Leonard,"i’m not answering the phone, sheldon."
14332,Leonard,it must be hell inside your head.
14333,Leonard,how teeny tiny?
14335,Leonard,"so, what do you need us for?"
14354,Leonard,comic book store.
14362,Leonard,"during the kissing? what did you do, sneeze in her mouth? i did that to a girl once."
14365,Leonard,"no doubt, no doubt. okay, well, i’m sorry it didn’t work out."
14366,Leonard,"yeah, how about that? see you soon."
14382,Leonard,wait a minute. he offered to send you to the north pole?
14388,Leonard,"all right, then go."
14391,Leonard,i could use the bathroom at 8:20.
14392,Leonard,it’s not gonna be the same without you.
14398,Leonard,"yeah. pretty cool, huh?"
14399,Leonard,"oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. sorry, i was gonna tell you."
14403,Leonard,no.
14406,Leonard,"i can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. oh, son of a bitch!"
14412,Leonard,"oh, a blanket."
14415,Leonard,"sheldon, sheldon?"
14430,Leonard,it was at least five mississippis. a standard hug is two mississippis tops.
14432,Leonard,i guess i’ll see you.
14444,Leonard,"yeah, i just stopped by to say…  yeah, so, hi!"
14451,Leonard,"no, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. look, we kept the original data. you can still publish the actual results."
14452,Leonard,"aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. so write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
14453,Leonard,"yeah, i feel terrible."
14455,Leonard,"man, i cannot catch a break."
14457,Leonard,howard…
14458,Leonard,"well, tell your genitals what i do with penny is none of their business."
14467,Leonard,"okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
14478,Leonard,– we took the red-eye.
14479,Leonard,"uh, no, thank you."
14480,Leonard,"uh, if you don’t mind, mrs. cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to los angeles, and you have no idea how much i want to be on it."
14484,Leonard,"no, this is my home now. thanks to you, my career is over and i will spend the rest of my life here in texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
14497,Leonard,"i’m not saying it was bad, i’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
14516,Leonard,more wine?
14530,Leonard,"hey. uh, what did sheldon say to you?"
14532,Leonard,i guess.
14534,Leonard,"good, good."
14535,Leonard,morning.
14543,Leonard,it’s a… 
14546,Leonard,"come on, you guys, let it go."
14548,Leonard,"it does. but in my experience, you don’t."
14550,Leonard,"howard, what did you do?"
14554,Leonard,oshikuru: demon samurai.
14565,Leonard,forget it.
14572,Leonard,let’s go.
14577,Leonard,oh. i’ll be there.
14580,Leonard,"so, what’s going on?"
14583,Leonard,i’ve always been a little confused about this. why don’t hindus eat beef?
14589,Leonard,what are you thinking?
14591,Leonard,"hi, howard."
14593,Leonard,uh-huh.
14594,Leonard,"you know, whatever."
14596,Leonard,oh. okay. tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. just throw it away.
14598,Leonard,"yeah, okay. um, howard, we need to talk."
14600,Leonard,"thank you. there’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, i was warming them up."
14606,Leonard,"warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
14607,Leonard,just play a potion card.
14608,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t ruin the game."
14610,Leonard,sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
14613,Leonard,what?
14618,Leonard,"oh, damn it. can i have a napkin?"
14621,Leonard,"because i’ve been busy, because i haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and i can’t stress how key this is, because i don’t want to."
14623,Leonard,fine. i’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
14630,Leonard,over puppets?
14634,Leonard,"come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. and you know that deep down inside, howard’s a really nice guy."
14636,Leonard,"girls don’t count klingon, howard. right?"
14637,Leonard,another delightful surprise for her.
14641,Leonard,how about that? einstein was wrong.
14644,Leonard,"if you’re referring to the work of benjamin franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. he also invented the franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. kites, ho."
14654,Leonard,sorry.
14659,Leonard,"oh, that’s excellent. it’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t"
14662,Leonard,"well, yeah, no, i met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. were they here today?"
14663,Leonard,of course not. why would they be? why would i ask? why am i rambling? why don’t you stop me?
14665,Leonard,"penny, i like all sorts of people. in fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."
14669,Leonard,"sure, sure, just i don’t know much about football."
14679,Leonard,unbelievable.
14682,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, please teach me about football. it’ll be fun."
14687,Leonard,when are you going to stop making cylon toast?
14691,Leonard,"well, i wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
14693,Leonard,"good-bye, sheldon."
14699,Leonard,"that completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. i can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
14700,Leonard,"penny, you know i’m lactose intolerant."
14701,Leonard,mimesis?
14706,Leonard,"no, i’ll watch the end of the game. besides, there’s only three minutes left."
14717,Leonard,hang on. some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
14720,Leonard,"okay, not to be pedantic, but the last i checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which i think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
14722,Leonard,i’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! i’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
14724,Leonard,are you listening to yourself? do you know how childish you sound right now?
14733,Leonard,"what am i supposed to say? sure, penny, i’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. well, leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because i’m penny and i’m pretty and i can do whatever the hell i want! oh, i get it! you think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! no, no, leonard! i’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
14735,Leonard,"calm down, we’ll make the movie."
14739,Leonard,"so, are we going to talk about last night?"
14742,Leonard,"no, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
14744,Leonard,"oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of time bandits."
14745,Leonard,"thanks, stuart. let me ask you something. do you think it’s okay for penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
14746,Leonard,thank you!
14748,Leonard,hey.
14753,Leonard,"oh, come on. sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that i don’t trust penny? sheldon? where did he go?"
14755,Leonard,why didn’t you say so?
14759,Leonard,eyes on the road. eyes on the road!
14762,Leonard,i’m not leaving until you talk to me.
14764,Leonard,"yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
14773,Leonard,"i wish penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
14776,Leonard,"mmmm, not bad."
14778,Leonard,"i can feel it. i can feel the earth moving. it’s moving too fast. raj, slow it down."
14781,Leonard,i hate my name. it has nerd in it. len nerd.
14792,Leonard,"quick, get forks."
14796,Leonard,"no, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
14806,Leonard,"i am here, right? you see me."
14815,Leonard,you’re not helping.
14817,Leonard,"no, no."
14824,Leonard,and the board of directors. abort! abort!
14827,Leonard,it upsets sheldon when you play with the sheldon.
14834,Leonard,"actually, my tests of the aharonov-bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
14841,Leonard,yeah? so?
14843,Leonard,has it ever worked?
14844,Leonard,"howard, relax, i’m not interested in your girlfriend."
14852,Leonard,"should i, um, leave you two alone?"
14853,Leonard,"okay, good, ’cause i wasn’t really gonna go."
14856,Leonard,he had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
14858,Leonard,it’s up to you. he didn’t call your experiment stupid.
14865,Leonard,here we go.
14866,Leonard,"merry newton-mas, everyone."
14867,Leonard,"no, he doesn’t."
14869,Leonard,tomorrow.
14872,Leonard,"you are, it’s just…"
14876,Leonard,um…
14887,Leonard,"not the time, sheldon."
14892,Leonard,no!
14898,Leonard,i don’t want tea.
14907,Leonard,what the hell is going on?
14916,Leonard,look at us. getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
14918,Leonard,"what are you trying to tell me, howard?"
14919,Leonard,don’t worry. we’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
14920,Leonard,got it.
14921,Leonard,"uh, sorry, raj. howard and i are going out to dinner with penny and bernadette."
14925,Leonard,"of course, i would never make fun of you."
14928,Leonard,"come on, penny."
14938,Leonard,"oh, couldn’t be better."
14939,Leonard,it’s not just cylons. superman’s next.
14946,Leonard,"hey. cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. i could never be mad at you."
14948,Leonard,would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
14952,Leonard,great.
14960,Leonard,so are our laptops.
14974,Leonard,"it’s getting scary here, too."
14981,Leonard,i’ll send them a basket of muffins.
14982,Leonard,where did you get all this stuff?
14984,Leonard,"sorry, let me help you."
14985,Leonard,"god, sheldon. what the hell are you doing out there?"
14987,Leonard,we were going to have…
14989,Leonard,"great, you do that."
14991,Leonard,sorry about that.
15008,Leonard,"great. your mom’s not coming, right?"
15009,Leonard,"you had some nice moves out there, howard."
15010,Leonard,yeah. did you notice all the people looking at us?
15011,Leonard,sorry. i’m moving a little slow. i think i bruised my coccyx.
15013,Leonard,"oh, my god! are you… "
15014,Leonard,are you okay?
15023,Leonard,thanks for not calling the cops.
15040,Leonard,"hang on. black beans, not pinto beans?"
15047,Leonard,only to shampoo professor chambourg’s shih tzu.
15054,Leonard,"hey, what are you and bernadette doing for your first valentine’s day?"
15058,Leonard,"actually, professor norton can’t make it. he threw his back out rock climbing."
15073,Leonard,we’re going to switzerland to see the cern supercollider! and ski. we’ll also go skiing.
15076,Leonard,not the roommate agreement.
15087,Leonard,rupert murdoch?
15091,Leonard,"uh, let’s see. yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
15095,Leonard,thanks. it’s good.
15097,Leonard,"okay, great. still not taking you to switzerland."
15100,Leonard,you’re not going to switzerland!
15107,Leonard,why don’t you enlighten me?
15108,Leonard,"just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in geneva, switzerland for our first valentine’s day."
15109,Leonard,thermal? ‘cause it’s gonna be cold.
15113,Leonard,penny? you okay?
15121,Leonard,"i can’t decide whether i want stan lee to autograph my journey into mystery 83, first appearance of thor or my fantastic four number five, first appearance of dr. doom. "
15124,Leonard,stan lee.
15129,Leonard,no.
15130,Leonard,that’s bruce lee.
15133,Leonard,"yeah, okay. no."
15148,Leonard,"don’t panic, this is better."
15154,Leonard,"okay, bye."
15155,Leonard,"ooh, look, an indiana jones connect-the-dots."
15159,Leonard,seedy underbelly?
15163,Leonard,"guys, it’s stolen. it should go back to peter jackson. he made the movies, it belongs to him."
15170,Leonard,will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
15176,Leonard,we’re not giving him two jet skis.
15179,Leonard,give me that.
15184,Leonard,and it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
15185,Leonard,you want to talk about endless patience? penny made me watch all five seasons of sex and the city.
15186,Leonard,"oh, crap!"
15187,Leonard,door. 
15189,Leonard,thank you.
15192,Leonard,peter jackson’s office in new zealand. it wasn’t ours.
15194,Leonard,"there wasn’t ever going to be a winner. there was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. is that really what you guys want? ‘cause if it is, fine, i don’t want anything to do with you. and i don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but i am not cleaning it up!  my precious."
15198,Leonard,you won.
15210,Leonard,"so, sheldon, how you doing?"
15217,Leonard,terrible. i worked really hard on that project. i stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
15218,Leonard,it wasn’t my fault. i had never seen my brother’s project. and my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
15233,Leonard,yeah.
15238,Leonard,what do you want from me? i just don’t give a rat’s ass.
15240,Leonard,"no, there was no spat."
15247,Leonard,you don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
15264,Leonard,"gets us out of our heads. you get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. that’s not what we’re doing tonight. tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
15269,Leonard,i’m not pressuring you.
15272,Leonard,"no, let her go."
15277,Leonard,okay.
15287,Leonard,"so, go."
15289,Leonard,"i’m not going out tonight, raj."
15292,Leonard,"yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
15299,Leonard,"oh, we really need to get you a girl."
15301,Leonard,"what do you want, sheldon?"
15308,Leonard,then why did you have chinese food with us?
15315,Leonard,"me neither. oh, sheldon seemed think that i would be upset about you hanging out with him. but i just want you to know it’s fine."
15317,Leonard,i was going to do that.
15326,Leonard,wish i knew. he’s fine with pluto.
15335,Leonard,yeah. shame he has to wake up.
15336,Leonard,smother sheldon in his sleep? wouldn’t that be wrong?
15340,Leonard,"yeah, it’s just one sneeze.  you’re on your own."
15344,Leonard,thank you. why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
15352,Leonard,"well, i understand, too."
15356,Leonard,is everything all right?
15365,Leonard,how do you take your coffee?
15368,Leonard,"oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
15374,Leonard,well…
15378,Leonard,how am i betraying you?
15381,Leonard,"are you having trouble sleeping? ‘cause, boy, i was up all night."
15387,Leonard,"hey, you."
15390,Leonard,coming right up.
15398,Leonard,"thanks. it’s really hard to find these in his size. so, listen. i’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
15411,Leonard,"for all i knew, he was the crazy one. he had this really deranged look."
15413,Leonard,"in retrospect, that was clue number two."
15429,Leonard,so i did something stupid. i’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. what were you doing seven years ago?
15444,Leonard,screw you guys. i’m gonna go see if she’s home.
15446,Leonard,it’s pretty cool. we’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. i thought you might want to see it.
15451,Leonard,"let me explain what we’re doing here. um, in 1969, the astronauts on apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
15456,Leonard,"right. uh yeah, funny. uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. raj, get them some glasses."
15466,Leonard,"come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
15472,Leonard,where’s penny?
15477,Leonard,"bummer. anyway, i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
15480,Leonard,"no, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. especially the whole rodeo thing."
15484,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
15488,Leonard,right. right. so how you doing?
15490,Leonard,"uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
15492,Leonard,"um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
15493,Leonard,"so, what do you say?"
15496,Leonard,"i was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
15500,Leonard,"i don’t think that’s going to happen, sheldon."
15501,Leonard,so how’s work?
15503,Leonard,his girlfriend.
15507,Leonard,yeah?
15508,Leonard,what?
15510,Leonard,"okay, let’s see."
15516,Leonard,"okay, come on. almost there."
15534,Leonard,wait a minute. you hate dogs.
15538,Leonard,it’s no big deal.
15539,Leonard,hmm? how much you got?
15542,Leonard,"sheldon, six bucks."
15550,Leonard,"funny how things work out, isn’t it?"
15554,Leonard,"and for rajesh koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken mcnuggets."
15568,Leonard,"fine, but don’t expect my help."
15573,Leonard,right.
15578,Leonard,that’s it. bye-bye. 
15585,Leonard,why are you introducing yourself?
15595,Leonard,you bumped the table and you know it.
15606,Leonard,"uh-huh. anyway, i’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
15608,Leonard,"okay, let me just get right to it. amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
15610,Leonard,"no, no, of course not. just have your relationship someplace else."
15611,Leonard,suffered in silence?
15612,Leonard,really? silence?
15616,Leonard,i didn’t agree with him.
15617,Leonard,"i tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
15624,Leonard,"no, i mean since the shamy hit a reef."
15628,Leonard,he got a cat to keep him company.
15631,Leonard,"hey.  oh, no."
15664,Leonard,"so anyway, howard asked penny to talk to bernadette, and she did, and bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
15669,Leonard,yeah.
15671,Leonard,"so anyway, that’s great news about you and bernadette."
15678,Leonard,"all i’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual hulk."
15707,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe.
15726,Leonard,"no, it’s just something i threw on."
15736,Leonard,what if she just comes over?
15738,Leonard,she’s been here before.
15739,Leonard,what do you want to do?
15744,Leonard,uh…
15747,Leonard,whoa!
15750,Leonard,whoa!
15754,Leonard,"look, uh, joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
15755,Leonard,you’re asking me out?
15760,Leonard,"i’m going too, i’ll show you where it is."
15763,Leonard,"hmm, priya’s not back yet? well, i guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
15771,Leonard,"yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…"
15803,Leonard,"making pretty good time, huh?"
15805,Leonard,please don’t tell anyone i spent the night with raj’s sister.
15812,Leonard,you?
15815,Leonard,yes.
15816,Leonard,"you can if you try. think about it this way, if i were batman and you were alfred, you’d keep that secret. right?"
15819,Leonard,what.
15826,Leonard,an orang-u-tan?
15836,Leonard,"look, i’m sorry raj, but the truth is i was with priya last night."
15837,Leonard,yeah.
15844,Leonard,"well, uh, i can’t believe you used sheldon’s toothbrush."
15845,Leonard,"okay, i, i, i think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. but come on, we’re friends. friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. for the record, howard, i’m sorry that i broke our pact."
15854,Leonard,"hi. i’m leonard. and you are beautiful. you pop, sparkle and buzz electric. i’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
15855,Leonard,congratulations howard.
15860,Leonard,"mulder and scully. x-files. the truth is out there. never mind. uh, so, what would you like to know?"
15861,Leonard,"yes. of course, we’re in different departments. he’s an engineer and i’m an experimental physicist. you know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, hello, maker of the universe, i see what you did there. good one."
15866,Leonard,want to get that?
15869,Leonard,what happened?
15879,Leonard,"actually, you don’t have insomnia. you’re sleeping now."
15881,Leonard,how about that gorn sitting on the couch?
15883,Leonard,94 seconds.
15885,Leonard,"when she comes out with eat, pray, run away from a giant boulder, i’ll read it."
15890,Leonard,"don’t worry, sheldon. we’ll be fine."
15897,Leonard,who‘s there?
15905,Leonard,"calm down, sheldon."
15906,Leonard,"had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?"
15912,Leonard,what is that?
15913,Leonard,"sheldon, this is crazy."
15917,Leonard,i’ll go get penny while that guy spits on our food.
15918,Leonard,"oh, um, is penny here?"
15931,Leonard,why do i bother talking to you people?
15932,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
15938,Leonard,"yeah, no, i don’t think so."
15946,Leonard,"thanks, wyatt. i’m a keeper."
15947,Leonard,maybe i could go in a little late.
15949,Leonard,"good night, wyatt. oh, good night, honey."
15950,Leonard,i love you.
15951,Leonard,"coming. hey, lovebug."
15954,Leonard,it’s not difficult for me. i’m having fun.
15957,Leonard,don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
15972,Leonard,i’ll friend you on facebook.
15984,Leonard,"12 years after high school, and i’m still at the nerd table."
15985,Leonard,really? this is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
15986,Leonard,every idea is better than this idea.
15989,Leonard,lesser warlord of ka’a.
15990,Leonard,infinite sheldon?
15992,Leonard,hey.
15993,Leonard,hey.
15994,Leonard,"oh, thanks."
15996,Leonard,"so, you and zack again, huh?"
15998,Leonard,a dolphin might.
15999,Leonard,you think penny’s right? were we bullying zack?
16000,Leonard,that happened to you?
16005,Leonard,"yeah, we came to talk to zack. hey, zack."
16009,Leonard,"uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store."
16012,Leonard,"hey, i got new boots this year. guaranteed to add three inches."
16020,Leonard,she didn’t tell you?
16021,Leonard,who else would it be?
16023,Leonard,"okay, let me see if i understand this. you want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
16034,Leonard,you’re being a bully.
16035,Leonard,what should we do?
16036,Leonard,"look, i know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but i’m a little warm, so i’m going to turn it down."
16037,Leonard,"i had a great idea. you know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing fourier analysis, or using the schrodinger equation?"
16040,Leonard,"oh, yay for me. what about you guys? i can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
16043,Leonard,i checked the app store. no one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
16055,Leonard,"so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
16056,Leonard,what?
16067,Leonard,"that’s enough, sheldon."
16078,Leonard,we’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
16080,Leonard,what are you doing?!
16083,Leonard,"no, that was completely called for. we need quiet."
16084,Leonard,"well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
16089,Leonard,"then i guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of l.a. on your flying pig."
16100,Leonard,although yours was an eye-opener.
16106,Leonard,"so, how do you wanna do this?"
16112,Leonard,"got it, got it. we can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
16115,Leonard,no.
16117,Leonard,true dat.
16120,Leonard,"i’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. i’ve dated four different women since we broke up and i didn’t tell any of them that i loved them and wanted to have their babies."
16122,Leonard,"penny’s here.  no, we don’t want to watch bridget jones’s diary!"
16128,Leonard,"i found another tweet from a student at sheldon’s lecture. dr. cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. plus, he looks like a giant insect."
16133,Leonard,yeah.
16137,Leonard,"oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
16140,Leonard,i’m still not adjusted to how the syfy channel spells their name now. s-y-f-y. that’s siffy.
16143,Leonard,it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.
16161,Leonard,"well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up."
16166,Leonard,"you kind of remind me of her. she enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
16171,Leonard,swell. i need a drink. do we have any alcohol?
16172,Leonard,"um, i’m not sure."
16175,Leonard,she hit on me.
16180,Leonard,"well, forget it! it’s not gonna happen."
16189,Leonard,"no, that’s okay."
16191,Leonard,oh. then what was last night about?
16194,Leonard,"oh, don’t say that. you’re a very attractive woman."
16196,Leonard,"i’m sure i would. but why, why, exactly?"
16210,Leonard,howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. he had a fight with his mother.
16214,Leonard,hold on. when did priya get here?
16215,Leonard,"yeah, that’s a real pickle. bye."
16222,Leonard,"penny, this is raj’s sister, priya."
16223,Leonard,really?
16227,Leonard,"oh, come on. it’s not boring at all. she’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. hmm?"
16233,Leonard,can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
16242,Leonard,what?
16256,Leonard,okay.
16263,Leonard,"did you know that, per our roommate agreement, i have to wash my feet before i get in the shower? and not in the sink. we each have special buckets."
16271,Leonard,hey. i thought you were with your new buddies.
16272,Leonard,morning.
16282,Leonard,thank you.
16293,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i’m, never mind."
16295,Leonard,one of them’s upstairs. the other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
16297,Leonard,no?
16302,Leonard,"okay, uh, how do i put this? um, are you familiar with darwin’s observation of the finches in the galapagos islands?"
16305,Leonard,so what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
16306,Leonard,"sure, that has birds in it."
16308,Leonard,yeah. the doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. it was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
16309,Leonard,"oh, yes. indeed, i did."
16316,Leonard, nope.
16318,Leonard,whatcha doin’?
16323,Leonard,is it racist that i took you to an indian restaurant?
16325,Leonard,"no, no, i do. it’s just i knew i was having curry tonight and i only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
16345,Leonard,"yeah, leonard hofstadter. what happened?"
16348,Leonard,"oh, no, not glenn?"
16352,Leonard,"i’m really sorry, sheldon."
16355,Leonard,"hey, penny. we’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
16366,Leonard,that’s a relief.
16368,Leonard,i’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
16376,Leonard,cover for me.
16378,Leonard,totally.
16379,Leonard,"sheldon, let’s go."
4096,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m going to do. i’m supposed to marry howard in a couple of weeks and i’m not sure i even know who the man is any more.
4100,Bernadette,my god! i thought you were my friend. 
6148,Bernadette,"hey, penny. what are you talking about? oh, that was you? long story. why don’t you go ahead and eat. we’re gonna be a while."
6151,Bernadette,howard!
4105,Bernadette,is there anything else about your past i should know?
6157,Bernadette,how’s she doing?
4110,Bernadette,what’s so great?
6158,Bernadette,"oh, big daddy, i don’t think so. you marry miss bernie, you marry me. we all family now."
6159,Bernadette,"don’t be that way. if you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. ooh."
4113,Bernadette,when?
4116,Bernadette,"no. that’s not how i want to start our marriage, killing your dream. we’ll have the wedding when you get back."
4117,Bernadette,we’ll call them. although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
4118,Bernadette,i’ll talk to him. he won’t say no to his little girl.
4121,Bernadette,give me those damn pringles.
4126,Bernadette,"howard, i don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married."
4132,Bernadette,seriously? you’re going to wear that thing to city hall?
4133,Bernadette,why wasn’t it a real proposal?
4138,Bernadette,are any of them still married?
4139,Bernadette,there’s got to be some place special we could do it.
4143,Bernadette,"not now, dad."
4146,Bernadette,sheldon! i told you no klingon.
4149,Bernadette,i love that man.
4152,Bernadette,it was. until i found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. let’s talk about that for a minute.
4155,Bernadette,do i look like i feel better?
4158,Bernadette,was she upset?
4165,Bernadette,do you think you and leonard might ever get married?
4169,Bernadette,are you gonna break up with him?
4171,Bernadette,"oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. i’m basically married to a sexy buzz lightyear."
4172,Bernadette,there’s my hubby. how’s everything going up there?
4173,Bernadette,what’s wrong?
4174,Bernadette,howard.
4181,Bernadette,"don’t worry. you’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary."
4184,Bernadette,"hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?"
4191,Bernadette,uh-huh.
4201,Bernadette,"no, i mean, he… never mind. there he is! howie!"
4202,Bernadette,i missed you so much.
4203,Bernadette,"oh, it’s just me."
4206,Bernadette,it’s just allergies.
4208,Bernadette,"yes, we do. you left right after we got married. this is like our honeymoon. now, hold on to your hat. oh. uh-oh."
4209,Bernadette,a little dizzy. must be the benadryl. switch places with me.
4211,Bernadette,i thought you liked halloween.
4221,Bernadette,tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
4225,Bernadette,how do i look?
4233,Bernadette,"whoa, drinky smurf. can i talk to you for a second?"
4245,Bernadette,i got it. why do you have a history textbook?
4250,Bernadette,got it.
4253,Bernadette,"yeah, doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us."
4256,Bernadette,i don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
6139,Bernadette,no!
4273,Bernadette,grab a box. we’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
4278,Bernadette,"okay. so, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?"
4280,Bernadette,i’m really sorry they took sheldon’s spot away. he shouldn’t have to suffer just because howard’s such a big deal now.
4281,Bernadette,what’s that supposed to mean?
4283,Bernadette,hang on. none of sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. my husband actually went to outer space.
4287,Bernadette,he’s not here. what’s wrong?
4298,Bernadette,you were parked in howard’s spot.
4301,Bernadette,the tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
4303,Bernadette,"you know, i’m kind of glad this happened."
4320,Bernadette,"sorry, raj, it’s girls’ night out."
4326,Bernadette,looks like he’s doing pretty good.
4328,Bernadette,jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
4333,Bernadette,who’s involved?
4334,Bernadette,i’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. leonard would never cheat on you.
4337,Bernadette,why?
4339,Bernadette,it’s cute how excited they are. you should have seen howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
4342,Bernadette,i’ve never even read a comic book. you guys?
4346,Bernadette,we were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
4359,Bernadette,what?
4363,Bernadette,how?
4368,Bernadette,"no, here’s how love works. you’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. oh, my god! are you actually thinking about it?"
4373,Bernadette,"yeah, fill her up. i’ll tell you when to stop."
4377,Bernadette,"sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy."
4379,Bernadette,uh-oh.
4382,Bernadette,thank you.
4384,Bernadette,where you’d never look.
4385,Bernadette,"geez, how close were you guys before we got married?"
4389,Bernadette,"guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in."
4402,Bernadette,"and i’m dr. rostenkowski wolowitz, and i’m a microbiologist."
4409,Bernadette,what if someone looks in there?
4414,Bernadette,"thanks. and, sheldon, i know tonight’s the night you eat thai food, so i went to the asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch."
4424,Bernadette,did you read it?
4427,Bernadette,"i get that. so, what do you want to do with it?"
4442,Bernadette,got a little surprise for you. come on.
4445,Bernadette,"sheldon, don’t you dare."
4446,Bernadette,that’s more like it.
4447,Bernadette,glad you’re feeling better.
4448,Bernadette,i think that’s enough wine for now.
4457,Bernadette,and you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
4458,Bernadette,"you know, there were a few moments today when i almost felt like we were a little family."
4460,Bernadette,where’d she go?
4464,Bernadette,cinnamon!
4477,Bernadette,"fine. no husbands, no boyfriends, some rules."
4488,Bernadette,"so, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
4490,Bernadette,what’s going on?
4492,Bernadette,"aw, i love you, too. if i don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, i’ll meet you in dreamland."
4498,Bernadette,it’s fine. i thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
4501,Bernadette,"boy, these drinks are strong. hoo, mama, i’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight."
4507,Bernadette,"yeah, that felt nice."
4510,Bernadette,your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like howard.
4522,Bernadette,"oh, that happened right after you left."
4530,Bernadette,"yeah, i know. its, it’s probably because i grew up with five brothers and sisters so i had to fight for every… oh, my god, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?"
4538,Bernadette,because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. 
4542,Bernadette,"hurry, sheldon and penny were right behind us in the bowling alley."
4557,Bernadette,"god, what is going on with you? "
4561,Bernadette,"if they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes."
4562,Bernadette,"you mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? no, that would be unethical."
4566,Bernadette,well?
4574,Bernadette,it’s just sometimes i feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
4583,Bernadette,what’s all this?
4584,Bernadette,howie.
4585,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
4589,Bernadette,hi.
4601,Bernadette,"so, how are you gonna tell raj abut what you did?"
4613,Bernadette,"oh, well, that’s a great idea."
4614,Bernadette,thanks for saving the day.
4615,Bernadette,i’ll help raj in here. why don’t you go keep my dad company?
4621,Bernadette,how’s it going out there?
4629,Bernadette,want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
4630,Bernadette,"come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here."
4639,Bernadette,"okay, um, well, first, i was late to a meeting ’cause i was stuck in traffic."
4643,Bernadette,"aw, you didn’t have to do that."
4647,Bernadette,"maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend raj."
4652,Bernadette,"yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
4662,Bernadette,never mind.
4663,Bernadette,"you know, i was thinking. without sheldon, most of us would have never met, but penny would still live across from him. "
4679,Bernadette,how many times do i have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
4682,Bernadette,sorry. did i startle you?
4686,Bernadette,"ooh, i was kind of hoping to get it before howie comes home from work."
4701,Bernadette,"well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
4703,Bernadette,"la-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
4712,Bernadette,i’m gonna fix this right now.
4715,Bernadette,"well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. to be honest, i bet howie 200"
4720,Bernadette,sorry.
4724,Bernadette,have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
4725,Bernadette,hey.
4728,Bernadette,"wow. well, what did you say?"
4732,Bernadette,so you’ll talk to him?
4748,Bernadette,now i feel a little gross.
4750,Bernadette,can i ask you something? why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
4756,Bernadette,you excited for texas?
4758,Bernadette,"no, in fact, he was so well-behaved, howie bought him a buzz aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream."
4761,Bernadette,i didn’t know his last name was bloom.
4776,Bernadette,aw.
4777,Bernadette,can i get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
4779,Bernadette,"well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign."
4794,Bernadette,yes.
4800,Bernadette,"yeah, what happened?"
4802,Bernadette,howie.
4806,Bernadette,we moved on.
4809,Bernadette,we kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
4810,Bernadette,"i’d tell you what i do with howard, but i don’t think dressing up like a catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with sheldon."
4814,Bernadette,"i gotta go. penny ratted me out. fyi, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet."
4816,Bernadette,"well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. and howie doesn’t think i take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while."
4823,Bernadette,happy star wars day.
4833,Bernadette,you’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? that’s so cruel.
4834,Bernadette,you are a putz.
4841,Bernadette,"so what? after two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
4849,Bernadette,"i know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. i don’t think the service is gonna send any more people."
4852,Bernadette,"i wanted to go to hawaii, not hell."
4865,Bernadette,"this job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the fda finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
4869,Bernadette,it’s too late to cancel. you’re going.
4877,Bernadette,great. when?
4878,Bernadette,"i don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. it seems like you could use this time to get a head start."
4879,Bernadette,but imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
4885,Bernadette,i know.
4886,Bernadette,exactly. does she not realize it or does she not care?
4888,Bernadette,"that sounds fun, but i promised penny i’d come by and help her study."
4892,Bernadette,yes.
4894,Bernadette,"nah, you got this. let’s go for a drink. i’ll call amy."
4904,Bernadette,that’s sixty feet.
4914,Bernadette,go get ’em.
4925,Bernadette,"come on, look how pretty you are. i’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you."
4926,Bernadette,and i’m sure you can turn it around.
4933,Bernadette,nope.
4941,Bernadette,"well, what do you want to do?"
4942,Bernadette,that sucks.
4944,Bernadette,we’re not seeing fairly manilow.
4958,Bernadette,"come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an australian man’s g-string like a baby kangaroo?"
4961,Bernadette,have you ever seen a body so fine?
4964,Bernadette,"speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, sheldon?"
4972,Bernadette,"how much, howie?"
4974,Bernadette,was it more or less than falconry school?
4976,Bernadette,that was a pity star. putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
4980,Bernadette,"well, sure. there’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. so even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him."
4988,Bernadette,"he was being funny. i’m pretty sure. anyway, i was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in california. isn’t that cool?"
5006,Bernadette,slutty.
5011,Bernadette,"ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
5015,Bernadette,i saw a picture of you two dancing together.
5016,Bernadette,that’s a neat tattoo.
5019,Bernadette,i like bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
5023,Bernadette,"yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. this is his turf."
5026,Bernadette,"well, what are some of the things they like?"
5029,Bernadette,hi.
5035,Bernadette,"it’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. but sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. you get it, right?"
5036,Bernadette,can i tell you something? this whole thing with raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.
5042,Bernadette,"oh. howie, be serious."
5057,Bernadette,what’s his problem?
5061,Bernadette,"i’m not a bully. i mean, maybe i come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody."
5070,Bernadette,"no, she’s right, and i just want you to know that from now on, i’m gonna be much more sensitive. i don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me."
5076,Bernadette,you’re kidding.
5078,Bernadette,"oh, my god. i thought everybody liked me, but i’m just a monster."
5079,Bernadette,"no, i’m the worst. i’m a terrible person."
5082,Bernadette,i guess that would be all right.
5090,Bernadette,what?
5092,Bernadette,then you’re both sad?
5095,Bernadette,i think the nicest gifts i’ve got from howie show how well he knows me.
5099,Bernadette,i told you not to wax down there. it’s itchy when it grows back.
5105,Bernadette,emily’s feelings?
5106,Bernadette,what happened?
5107,Bernadette,don’t you think you should make him stop all this?
5108,Bernadette,"okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?"
5110,Bernadette,‘cause it would be fun to watch.
5118,Bernadette,"yeah, well, amy writes little house on the prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the internet."
5120,Bernadette,we got embarrassed tonight. come on.
5126,Bernadette,because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
5127,Bernadette,i was just kidding. i’m sorry. and the story’s really good.
5128,Bernadette,please?
5133,Bernadette,because you have a wife.
5136,Bernadette,"stuart, this place looks amazing."
5138,Bernadette,why don’t we leave so you can cool off?
5140,Bernadette,"howie, if the store succeeds, stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
5149,Bernadette,"so, where is it?"
5152,Bernadette,what?
5157,Bernadette,okay. but you got a lot of receipts for the lego store in here.
5158,Bernadette,a two hundred dollar r2-d2 is a business expense?
5162,Bernadette,she sounds really mad.
5171,Bernadette,"well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?"
5180,Bernadette,"okay. well, i’ll keep it together if you can."
5184,Bernadette,"hey. sheldon, leonard, living room, right now!"
5192,Bernadette,you can’t just decide. how about i arm-wrestle you?
5197,Bernadette,"i don’t know much about doctor who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the tardis, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the tardis is bigger than the outside. but then again, i don’t know much about<i> doctor who."
5199,Bernadette,"oh, come on, like you even care."
5204,Bernadette,one-five. two-five. three-five. four-five. five-five.
5205,Bernadette,six. seven. eight. nine. ten-ten.
5213,Bernadette,"so, josh, what do you do?"
5214,Bernadette,"oh, how nice. i loved finding nemo."
5217,Bernadette,keep dreaming.
5226,Bernadette,you’re being childish.
5231,Bernadette,there’s my big boss man.
5233,Bernadette,"properly, at all. it’s just words i’ve never heard."
5236,Bernadette,don’t forget your wallet.
5240,Bernadette,what?
5241,Bernadette,i call tech support all the time.
5250,Bernadette,look at that. you cleaned it up all by yourself.
5256,Bernadette,that’s not true. we were just laughing right in your face.
5258,Bernadette,you know which yoghurt i mean.
5269,Bernadette,"so, anyway, what i’m trying to say is… "
5272,Bernadette,"for god’s sake, sheldon, what are you doing?"
5274,Bernadette,"sheldon, shh. the wedding’s starting."
5276,Bernadette,"no, we totally won."
5282,Bernadette,hands off. i’m mad at you.
5285,Bernadette,"i mean, if penny finds out i’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think i’m a terrible friend. i wish you never told me."
5296,Bernadette,good for you.
5300,Bernadette,you really never had that done?
5311,Bernadette,"okay, amy, your turn."
5312,Bernadette,what did we do?
5327,Bernadette,sure. so how can we help?
5340,Bernadette,howie?
5342,Bernadette,"hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? stuart."
5352,Bernadette,"ew, check out his tiny teeth. he looks like a man-dolphin."
5358,Bernadette,hey. you got a minute?
5361,Bernadette,"look, i get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but i want this to feel like my house, too."
5364,Bernadette,whatcha doing?
5376,Bernadette,i told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because i didn’t want to disappoint him.
5394,Bernadette,no. stalkers are creepy. i’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
5402,Bernadette,"hey, hey, they’re leaving."
5417,Bernadette,happy thanks… yikes.
5422,Bernadette,yeah. you’re inviting him into your home. it’s intimate. it’s where your underpants live.
5427,Bernadette,you mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
5428,Bernadette,are you stalking him? that’s creepy.
5431,Bernadette,come in.
5439,Bernadette,"great. and then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
5442,Bernadette,"no, they’re not."
5443,Bernadette,do you think sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
5452,Bernadette,i guess so.
5460,Bernadette,i’m being serious.
5465,Bernadette,"no, that’s not what this feeling is. is it?"
5467,Bernadette,"yeah. ew, we are missing him!"
5471,Bernadette,you’re gonna want to take these with food.
5473,Bernadette,and he made it all better.
5477,Bernadette,"okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her."
5486,Bernadette,you’re right. it could totally happen.
5487,Bernadette,you still have a girlfriend.
5489,Bernadette,don’t make it too hot.
5497,Bernadette,anything else?
5500,Bernadette,it is valentine’s day. how about valentino?
5503,Bernadette,he’s so little. i’m sure it’s fine.
5514,Bernadette,"i know, it’s crazy."
5515,Bernadette,"oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out."
5521,Bernadette,"i am. of-of course i am. i’m, i’m sure it’s just the hormones. but it’s weird, howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and i was all excited to tell him because i thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and i’m gonna get fat."
3475,Bernadette,"oh, raj, you’re our guest."
5524,Bernadette,where?
5525,Bernadette,can’t drink.
3483,Bernadette,no.
3485,Bernadette,no.
5534,Bernadette,"i was headed to the bathroom, and i passed howie on his way out. usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here."
3490,Bernadette,i know how you feel. my mother makes me crazy.
3494,Bernadette,that’s nothing. i couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid i’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
5545,Bernadette,doing great.
5547,Bernadette,"i can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, sheldon."
5548,Bernadette,a little. and it doesn’t help that i’ve got this heightened sense of smell.
5551,Bernadette,"you don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?"
5554,Bernadette,i wonder how much she spent on this.
5559,Bernadette,what is it?
3512,Bernadette,is this more comedy that i don’t understand?
3513,Bernadette,"so, this isn’t a joke?"
5560,Bernadette,"so, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
5561,Bernadette,"i know, but…"
5563,Bernadette,"if you want to sign a contract that sheldon whipped up, go ahead."
3531,Bernadette,"oh, i find it fascinating. if i hadn’t gone into microbiology, i probably would have gone into physics. or ice dancing."
5580,Bernadette,what’s going on?
3534,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, show me. in microbiology, the most exciting thing i get to work with is yeast."
3543,Bernadette,sure.
3544,Bernadette,howard?
3545,Bernadette,it unhooks in the front.
3546,Bernadette,i guess i should go.
5591,Bernadette,"i didn’t, but raj volunteered."
5598,Bernadette,"it’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up."
3551,Bernadette,"hey, leonard. am i too late to see the experiment? oh, hi."
5599,Bernadette,leave it alone. he means well.
3555,Bernadette,"what do you think, leonard? should i give him another chance?"
3567,Bernadette,when howard tried to do the splits…
3568,Bernadette,with marbles?
5618,Bernadette,you guys have fun. i’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
3571,Bernadette,which leads to…?
5619,Bernadette,he’s gonna be okay.
3573,Bernadette,i’m going to count to three. one…
5620,Bernadette,why are you dressed like that?
5622,Bernadette,you all right?
3576,Bernadette,"hi, guys."
3578,Bernadette,"clearly you are. otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now."
5628,Bernadette,i brought sparkling cider.
3581,Bernadette,"sorry, i had to clock out."
5631,Bernadette,yeah.
3586,Bernadette,no.
5636,Bernadette,what is it about trains that you like so much?
3589,Bernadette,so you’ve been seeing other girls?
3594,Bernadette,had sex?
3597,Bernadette,"howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move."
5645,Bernadette,"i storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
5647,Bernadette,i stab it in the middle eye.
3601,Bernadette,"oh, not now. we’re starting a new relationship. i need to get to know you again."
3602,Bernadette,"be patient, we’ll get there."
5653,Bernadette,"amy’s with sheldon who she loves like a son. you’re with her son, who she doesn’t."
5656,Bernadette,some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
5657,Bernadette,"well, let’s get back to penny. hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?"
3611,Bernadette,"oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk."
3612,Bernadette,"oh. well, maybe you can join us. i’ll ask penny."
5662,Bernadette,who’s going to officiate?
3624,Bernadette,why are you still hanging out with leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
3625,Bernadette,yeah.
3626,Bernadette,yeah.
5673,Bernadette,because you were driving like a lunatic.
5674,Bernadette,it didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
3629,Bernadette,where exactly on the internet have you been looking?
5677,Bernadette,"okay, i think we’re ready."
5679,Bernadette,"not just leonard and penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
3633,Bernadette,"so we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?"
3635,Bernadette,"hold on. wait. no, it’s okay, go ahead."
3646,Bernadette,you just have to look.
3648,Bernadette,"oh, thanks. howard gave it to me. it’s the cutest thing. every time i have dinner with his mom, the next day i get jewellery."
5697,Bernadette,hey. what brings you by?
3652,Bernadette,couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to npr?
5700,Bernadette,i’m furious.
5702,Bernadette,it had to be barbara. i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
3656,Bernadette,"yeah, it sounds fun. super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"
5707,Bernadette,did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
5711,Bernadette,thank you.
5724,Bernadette,"oh, i appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me."
3679,Bernadette,i’m too hot to go out with a guy like glenn?
3681,Bernadette,howard’s a complete and total ass.
3683,Bernadette,"sure. i think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. it’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. as a microbiologist, i can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
5731,Bernadette,"oh, i was gonna start at the end. thank god you’re here."
5734,Bernadette,"this was the husband and this was the wife. they’d go out on adventures together. cruises, skiing, horseback riding. that was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
5738,Bernadette,does it really need one?
5739,Bernadette,"well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so i guess the theme was bloody homicide photos."
5740,Bernadette,are you just gonna name all the colours?
5741,Bernadette,i don’t care what colour the room is.
3694,Bernadette,did you hear? isn’t it terrible?
3697,Bernadette,that’s how i heard it.
3698,Bernadette,"okay, raj, i know you’ve been avoiding me and howard, and i’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours."
5745,Bernadette,"it’s my baby. i, i should care about nurseries and colours, and i don’t. what’s wrong with me?"
3700,Bernadette,it’s cute. you sound a little like a drunken monkey. ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
5751,Bernadette,thank you. i feel better now.
3705,Bernadette,"it’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap."
3706,Bernadette,stay.
5753,Bernadette,"let me see the sonogram again. oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
3711,Bernadette,great.
5760,Bernadette,"this is ridiculous. the doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, raj knows, his grey’s anatomy online fan group probably knows. is it weird we don’t?"
5763,Bernadette,"good. call him. wait, i’m not sure i want to know."
3716,Bernadette,i’m listening.
3718,Bernadette,really?
3720,Bernadette,"this is so great. i love you, howard."
3722,Bernadette,wow.
5770,Bernadette,you just heard me throwing up.
5771,Bernadette,you’re so weird.
5776,Bernadette,"wait, i have my ipad."
3730,Bernadette,wait a minute. are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
3733,Bernadette,hi.
5783,Bernadette,"is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
3741,Bernadette,what’s that?
3742,Bernadette,"oh, god, that is so romantic."
3743,Bernadette,leonard’s really one of a kind.
5793,Bernadette,which mit did you go to?
3753,Bernadette,yeah.
5804,Bernadette,"i’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?"
3757,Bernadette,yes.
5805,Bernadette,it’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
5810,Bernadette,soon.
3764,Bernadette,i do. amy and sheldon sitting in a tree. k-i-s-s-s-s-i-n-g.
5812,Bernadette,"actually, it’s been ready for weeks."
5813,Bernadette,"well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling sheldon they’re behind schedule."
5820,Bernadette,"great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
3774,Bernadette,did i tell you priya invited me and howard to have dinner with her and leonard?
5823,Bernadette,mine has a fully developed immune system.
3778,Bernadette,i don’t understand. i thought i was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
5830,Bernadette,"fine, then do it."
3784,Bernadette,i don’t know. the regular way people meet astronauts.
5834,Bernadette,i think he looks cute.
5835,Bernadette,"stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift."
3788,Bernadette,"maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?"
5836,Bernadette,a foot massage?
5837,Bernadette,how come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
3792,Bernadette,they’re just asking me all sorts of questions i can’t answer.
5843,Bernadette,howard just did that.
5844,Bernadette,"stuart, you cooked?"
3798,Bernadette,i don’t want to do this anymore!
5846,Bernadette,you have a batsuit.
5850,Bernadette,"great, go with the giraffes."
3804,Bernadette,yes. are you writing a book?
3815,Bernadette,he hasn’t told her yet. he’s waiting for the right time.
5864,Bernadette,how could you?
5871,Bernadette,i know.
3824,Bernadette,me? why me?
5874,Bernadette,"i remember thinking this is stupid, and i was right."
5875,Bernadette,"no. if one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, i’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
5876,Bernadette,hi.
3829,Bernadette,shut up! she said i’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
5877,Bernadette,sorry we’re late.
3835,Bernadette,"i wanted to. come on, open it."
3837,Bernadette,you jerk face! what did you tell howard? did you say there was something going on between us? because he thinks there is. he’s completely freaking out!
5885,Bernadette,that was so fast.
5887,Bernadette,"nothing, these are happy tears."
5893,Bernadette,"thank you, sheldon, i’m feeling better now."
5894,Bernadette,"yeah, eventually i figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
5895,Bernadette,shh. she’s asleep.
3848,Bernadette,hang on. you seriously think i’m going to live with your mother?
3851,Bernadette,take me home now.
3854,Bernadette,"yeah. yeah, i guess. does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
5905,Bernadette,things going well with you and sheldon living together?
3868,Bernadette,we went cake-tasting yesterday. raj came along. he cried and ate half the samples.
3869,Bernadette,"you know, i met a really cute girl at work. she’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
5916,Bernadette,is that emily your ex-girlfriend?
5917,Bernadette,"why would you do that, raj?"
3872,Bernadette,hang on a second. nasa doesn’t have a shuttle any more. how are you going to get up there?
3877,Bernadette,"just stop talking, howard."
5925,Bernadette,"oh, thank you."
5928,Bernadette,call if there’s any problems.
5931,Bernadette,"raj, what’s going on?"
3884,Bernadette,no.
5932,Bernadette,"i’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer."
3889,Bernadette,"really. if going into space means that much to you, i will never say another word about it."
5940,Bernadette,"you think that stuff is fun? being a parent is terrifying. i’m constantly worried, i’m always tired, and in a few minutes i’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
3895,Bernadette,do you guys think it was a mistake? am i the bad guy in this?
5944,Bernadette,and there they go.
5945,Bernadette,"oh, it’s okay. it’s good to get out of the house."
3901,Bernadette,i know. i’m sorry. i got scared.
5952,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, raj. we really just don’t have the space."
3908,Bernadette,howard has a heart condition! you know that!
3909,Bernadette,"this is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
5958,Bernadette,"oh, dear god, you’re cheating on me with raj. "
3914,Bernadette,really?
3916,Bernadette,i don’t know. dead people’s dresses?
5964,Bernadette,see where i’m going with this?
5965,Bernadette,"if you don’t know how to make lasagna, google does."
5967,Bernadette,i really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
3921,Bernadette,we thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. i feel terrible.
3923,Bernadette,"oh, you know, just pillow talk. you guys have nothing to worry about."
5971,Bernadette,he’s such a sweetie. 
3925,Bernadette,hello.
3927,Bernadette,"amy, we’re really sorry."
5980,Bernadette,what’s so funny?
3944,Bernadette,i didn’t have any.
3945,Bernadette,"amy, really? twister?"
5994,Bernadette,"well, have you talked to them about it?"
5995,Bernadette,"look, raj just gets along with women. "
3950,Bernadette,"looks like it’s just us playing.  penny, we’re out of wine!"
3953,Bernadette,"i don’t think i can meet the girl who was always mean to me. tammy bodnick. one time while i was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
3962,Bernadette,what about helping people?
3965,Bernadette,penny.
3967,Bernadette,"god, they’re cute. oh, why did they have to be cute?"
3974,Bernadette,"oh, ah, right.  and now, the great howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
3976,Bernadette,"well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?"
6030,Bernadette,i’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
3984,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. i know it makes me sound like a bad person, but i just don’t like children."
3985,Bernadette,"right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and i’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
6042,Bernadette,"okay. okay, sweetie, mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
6044,Bernadette,"she’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care."
6046,Bernadette,"thank you. okay, i’m gonna try and get some work done."
6047,Bernadette,"love you, too. bye."
4002,Bernadette,do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
6050,Bernadette,"let me just say good-bye. halley. look at mommy. over here, honey. say good-bye to mommy. look at me. look at your mother. all right, we can go."
4007,Bernadette,"boy, i don’t know if i could be friends with howie if we broke up."
4009,Bernadette,with access to weaponised smallpox.
4010,Bernadette,howard.
6064,Bernadette,"seriously, where were you?"
6066,Bernadette,oh. what’d she say?
6067,Bernadette,"first of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from south carolina."
6075,Bernadette,so you’re gonna be roommates with bert?
4028,Bernadette,are you mad at me?
6079,Bernadette,want me to put on some neil diamond? that always makes you feel better.
4037,Bernadette,and ugly.
6095,Bernadette,"oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. stop. i love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
4048,Bernadette,cool. how do they do that?
4049,Bernadette,you threw up?
4053,Bernadette,survival training? is that like camping?
6102,Bernadette,i guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
4056,Bernadette,you’re so brave. i’m proud of you.
4057,Bernadette,are you crying?
4062,Bernadette,"oh, i love you."
4063,Bernadette,get that guy! get that guy! pew! pew! pew! pew!
4067,Bernadette,i can’t help it. my howie wowie has an owie.
4068,Bernadette,"i’m gonna go, too."
4069,Bernadette,i’ll miss you.
6116,Bernadette,"they say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow."
6119,Bernadette,my universe!
4075,Bernadette,"raj, howie told me what’s going on with you and lakshmi."
6123,Bernadette,he didn’t try them yet!
4078,Bernadette,metrosexual my ass.
4079,Bernadette,"every time i spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im."
4080,Bernadette,"oh, my god, that’s terrible."
6129,Bernadette,howie? howie?
6133,Bernadette,then red hulk must be worthy.
6134,Bernadette,you don’t know his life.
4091,Bernadette,that’s nice.
4092,Bernadette,"you ain’t goin’ anywhere, threeway."
4093,Bernadette,"you lied to me. you said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or raj!"
4094,Bernadette,don’t you try and blame this on him.
0,Amy,"o’er the land of the free, and the home of the… next."
2049,Amy,thank you. acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
2053,Amy,"let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. oh, how about this one up on the log?"
6,Amy,"i don’t object to the concept of a deity, but i’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
8,Amy,"tepid water, please."
2058,Amy,of course not.
2060,Amy,"i’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get."
2068,Amy,can’t you just tell me?
2070,Amy,"you know, sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day. but a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. and silly as it sounds, i thought that meant something."
2072,Amy,what i want is for us to be planning our future together.
2073,Amy,we’re on the same planet.
30,Amy,is he always like this when he loses?
2080,Amy,"oh, let me see."
33,Amy,hello.
2085,Amy,think about it. how would you feel if you were referred to as part of leonard’s team?
2086,Amy,so you see what i’m getting at?
2088,Amy,try again.
42,Amy,i doubt you’d understand. sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
2098,Amy,"yes, so please behave yourselves."
2099,Amy,all these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. feels like we could be an 18th century french salon.
53,Amy,excellent point.
59,Amy,next!
2108,Amy,"yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?"
61,Amy,"from a neurobiological standpoint, leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation."
65,Amy,cornucopia. what a mellifluous word.
72,Amy,i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother.
2120,Amy,keep talking.
2122,Amy,can you please pass the salt?
75,Amy,don’t be absurd. i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
2123,Amy,is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
2125,Amy,"according to the codicil of the relationship agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night."
78,Amy,"good night, sheldon."
83,Amy,see? it’s working.
84,Amy,girls’ night? what does that entail?
2131,Amy,"you know, there’s nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort."
87,Amy,"yes. in fact, our menses are synchronized. penny. bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night."
92,Amy,"so anyway, to make a long story short, turns out i have an unusually firm cervix."
93,Amy,shame. ‘cause i have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
2142,Amy,it’s a big fort.
2147,Amy,"yes, they are."
2148,Amy,"okay, have a seat on the floor."
102,Amy,"hang on. i’m familiarizing myself with the rules. seems fairly straightforward. bernadette, truth or dare?"
105,Amy,oh. all right. what is the circumference of your areolas?
2162,Amy,"i didn’t kill anything. you did, talking about your stupid tv show."
115,Amy,"well, the internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism."
2163,Amy,"really? that’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
2165,Amy,"i’ve been thinking about them, too, sheldon. being your girlfriend is so challenging. emotionally, physically. i’ve been incredibly patient for years."
118,Amy,"did you know that the iconic valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?"
2168,Amy,"bye, sheldon."
122,Amy,hoo.
2171,Amy,wow. hope i can catch the bouquet from here.
2173,Amy,"well, it’s only been 11 hours."
130,Amy,"elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing."
2178,Amy,there’s no guy.
2179,Amy,i’m not gonna be alone. i’ll be with my friends.
133,Amy,zack.
134,Amy,ask what?
2181,Amy,thank you for doing this.
136,Amy,hoo.
2182,Amy,"we were together for so long, i honestly don’t know what i’m feeling."
138,Amy,i’m not saying hoo now. i said hoo last night.
2184,Amy,"sheldon, you being here might not be making things better."
2185,Amy,"they didn’t invite everybody but you.bernadette invited me, and stuart lives here."
2188,Amy,"you know what, sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. you’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. i don’t need any more time to think. we’re broken up."
145,Amy,religion?
146,Amy,no.
2195,Amy,i’m hanging up.
148,Amy,what are you doing?
2198,Amy,no one’s talking about sonny and cher.
153,Amy,i’m sure it’ll wash off.
2205,Amy,whose bra is this?
2206,Amy,it’s penny’s.
159,Amy,as am i. 
2210,Amy,that’s because you made him more confident.
163,Amy,"shame. since you’re my best friend, i thought it would be a good bonding opportunity."
164,Amy,don’t you read my blog?
165,Amy,do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in big sur?
2213,Amy,i only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
169,Amy,i don’t believe there’s any such thing.
2217,Amy,"boy, that was a long night for me."
171,Amy,"no, we discussed it. we decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well."
2219,Amy,"fine, i guess. i’ve been focusing on me. i was thinking about changing my wardrobe."
176,Amy,"so, girl talk?"
2224,Amy,"i know, but sheldon had this clause in the relationship agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a klingon."
178,Amy,sometimes i think it might be nice to have one.
2225,Amy,really? you have a piercing gun?
183,Amy,"word of warning, though. i’m prone to night terrors, so if i wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. just pin me down and stroke my hair, and i’ll be fine."
2231,Amy,"that wasn’t so bad. nice. boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet."
2241,Amy,"i don’t know how to help you. you know, feelings are a part of life."
2242,Amy,i don’t think that was the point of the movie.
2244,Amy,i can’t believe he ran my credit.
197,Amy,"i’m not finished. all scientists have to fund-raise, sheldon. how do you think i paid for my lab?"
199,Amy,"and consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh."
200,Amy,"well, then prepare to be terrified. if your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department."
2251,Amy,"stuart, believe it or not, i understand. you know, before i met sheldon, i was alone for a really long time. i was so desperate for people to like me, when i met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity."
2254,Amy,barry kripke just asked me out.
2255,Amy,"hi, how are you? i was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime."
2259,Amy,"oh, i don’t have to imagine it."
2260,Amy,hello.
213,Amy,i’m regretting my earlier cattiness. she is an absolute delight.
214,Amy,i just wanted to check in on you.
215,Amy,"it seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched bengal tiger."
216,Amy,"it’s okay, it’s okay."
2263,Amy,how’d that go?
219,Amy,"sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset."
2269,Amy,"uh, excuse me, can i have my phone back?"
224,Amy,your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
228,Amy,so needy.
229,Amy,"yo, p-dog."
2279,Amy,three.
232,Amy,"she used to be much more fun, until leonard punched her in the heart."
2281,Amy,"well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
2287,Amy,i’m gonna go look for other shoes.
242,Amy,"saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?"
244,Amy,i think you’re on.
246,Amy,i’m drunk.
2294,Amy,i’m trying not to. do you know him?
2297,Amy,yes. yep. we were on a date. very much like this one.
250,Amy,"well, well, well. look who it is."
2298,Amy,what was the rest of your question?
253,Amy,"i’m glad you talked me into this. we work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly."
2301,Amy,"not as a valentine’s present, no."
2304,Amy,thank you.
258,Amy,did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
2307,Amy,no problem. i’m really sorry about your car.
2309,Amy,"i’m, i’m really sorry."
2312,Amy,"okay, get out."
2315,Amy,"sheldon, i can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
2316,Amy,"well it is thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so i’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. but if you mean between us, i think it’ll be fine."
271,Amy,"slow down, sheldon. i’m not quite there yet."
2321,Amy,no. you?
274,Amy,i should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
275,Amy,pun intended?
276,Amy,"not important. i described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective."
2322,Amy,i might go visit my aunt next week.
2325,Amy,sheldon. we’ve known each other a long time. we are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the internet.
2326,Amy,i don’t know. just ask me whatever comes to mind.
2328,Amy,"no. it’s okay. if we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
2330,Amy,go ahead.
284,Amy,"and that opens her up to justifiable ridicule for wearing them. good one, bernadette. see? ker-razy."
287,Amy,i’m available for experimentation.
291,Amy,my burps taste like cranberry juice.
2339,Amy,"it’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill."
2341,Amy,"hmm. well, i wouldn’t fight the eel, because i know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. so i’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days i feel bloated."
2345,Amy,i miss this.
2349,Amy,"it was. uh, listen, i, i was thinking that, um, maybe i’m ready to be your girlfriend again."
2357,Amy,great.
310,Amy,sheldon?
2358,Amy,how ’bout saturday?
312,Amy,terrific. thank you.  they were out of menthols! get off my back! not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
313,Amy,"i must say, penny, this is great fun."
2361,Amy,"oh, he’s coming here. i’m actually making dinner."
315,Amy,of course i have. but they were strangers and seemed off-put when i engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
2362,Amy,it is?
328,Amy,"come on, strawberries. take one for the team."
332,Amy,look.
2392,Amy,"i, i can’t believe it. i, i don’t know what to say."
2393,Amy,i do know what to say. let’s get me waxed.
348,Amy,just change the subject.
2397,Amy,do you like it?
351,Amy,architect. where would you have met an astronaut?
352,Amy,"it’s indeed admirable. although, it is microbiology."
2399,Amy,"so, what’d you have in mind for tonight?"
2404,Amy,yes.
2406,Amy,"so, um, should i get under the covers with you?"
359,Amy,obviously. now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
361,Amy,that doesn’t interest me. goodbye.
362,Amy,keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
363,Amy,"well, i heard who you did."
2409,Amy,"well, i’ve been waiting for this for so long, i’ve just built it up in my head. i don’t know what to expect."
365,Amy,"she ruled russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
366,Amy,"she engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. i’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little indian boy."
2415,Amy,i will. i wish you were here.
2425,Amy,"sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. that’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended."
378,Amy,i’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
2430,Amy,"everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them."
388,Amy,"yes, i am."
389,Amy,"sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean i have to participate."
2438,Amy,how was your trip?
394,Amy,everything except bra and panties. and they’re a leopard-spotted secret i share with victoria.
2445,Amy,"oh, well, you know, now, now that i’m hearing it, it does sound familiar."
2448,Amy,"why not? you, you just said it’s okay for her to work."
401,Amy,"no, no, i’m sorry, i’m so sorry. i take it all back. look. i’m, uh, i’m sitting in your chair. there’s nothing wrong with it. it’s a great chair. please let me continue to be part of your world. ow!"
2451,Amy,"well, maybe i don’t like you either."
406,Amy,"leonard, please. i don’t need the running commentary."
407,Amy,yo.
415,Amy,"mm-hmm. dear leonard, you’re really good at science. maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork."
419,Amy,glad to hear it. i need someone to accompany me to the wedding of dr. moranelli and dr. gustufson this friday. they’re kind of the brad and angelina of the primatology department.
421,Amy,"doesn’t matter. you’re out, he’s in. no date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. hmm, how times change."
424,Amy,i got you this to give to me.
2480,Amy,"rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
434,Amy,"we just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if i can sweat through these dress shields."
2485,Amy,"oh, looks like we just lost kripke."
438,Amy,the hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
2488,Amy,"now? oh, looks like we just lost kripke."
442,Amy,"no, thanks. i’m gonna head home."
463,Amy,are you sure? the infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
2512,Amy,i do know what that’s like. i really do.
465,Amy,"actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  sure you’re not coming down with a cold?"
469,Amy,"uh, i was hoping you wouldn’t notice. irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
2518,Amy,"so sheldon, there’s something i’ve been wanting to talk about but i know it’s kind of a touchy subject."
2519,Amy,"well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and i was hoping maybe this year we could."
474,Amy,"it’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
475,Amy,"the real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week."
476,Amy,"i don’t know, four or five years."
2522,Amy,i’m sorry i brought it up.
2523,Amy,but it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
481,Amy,i wanted to be alone.
484,Amy,penny and bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
2537,Amy,"well, he’s seen me without pants on."
2538,Amy,"if i may, i, i’d like to propose a toast. um, thank you all for coming tonight. i know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but i feel like i got the greatest gift the day he was born."
494,Amy,what are you doing here?
2548,Amy,"oh, my."
2551,Amy,"well, to be fair, howard’s idea was based on sheldon’s math."
2553,Amy,and his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
2555,Amy,"sheldon, what did you do?"
509,Amy,"what? wait, is this some kind of practical joke? like in norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
512,Amy,"i feel like crying. of course, i could just be hormonal. oh, wait. maybe our menses are finally syncing up. bernadette? no? penny?"
2560,Amy,"the video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
516,Amy,"i’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
520,Amy,you do.
2569,Amy,"well, the guy at the store said this one is great."
529,Amy,guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
538,Amy,"i don’t know. he’s nice. he’s funny. he has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. that’s kind of hot."
545,Amy,"hi, stuart."
2593,Amy,all of it?
548,Amy,"um, good night, stuart."
2596,Amy,"okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?"
551,Amy,it’s so romantic.
2599,Amy,i don’t.
2603,Amy,it’s not a contest.
558,Amy,"when leonard gets back, i’d love to check his serotonin levels. do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
559,Amy,"that’s nothing. in ninth grade, the girls put rogaine in my hand lotion. within six months, the nicknames began to fly. i think the one that hurt the most was gorilla fingers fowler."
2608,Amy,oh. okay.
561,Amy,did kathy geiger laugh?
566,Amy,i never doubted you.
2614,Amy,"and yet, you can’t."
2619,Amy,"you know, if that study’s real, leonard might come back smarter than you."
578,Amy,"sheldon, i’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
2626,Amy,so what do we do now?
2634,Amy,you know the rules. drink.
2642,Amy,"well, i know how he feels. i never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
602,Amy,"if you and leonard get back together, sheldon and i will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
603,Amy,"fine, we can double with you, too. so insecure."
611,Amy,you okay?
613,Amy,it’s ferdinand t. flag. i thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
2663,Amy,yeah. cool.
2665,Amy,"so, sheldon and bernadette are hanging out."
625,Amy,i’m excited to work with my boyfriend. it’s gonna be romantic.
626,Amy,"come on, sheldon. we can be like marie curie and her husband, pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. screw beauty and the beast, that’s the love story disney should tell."
2673,Amy,mike degrasse tyson?
2681,Amy,we’re not going shopping together.
2684,Amy,"i’m sorry, i’ve been going on and on."
638,Amy,"hey, i’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. you’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom."
640,Amy,maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
646,Amy,what do you want?
2694,Amy,"oh, sure. i’ll, i’ll talk to sheldon about it. you know, bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut."
2695,Amy,i know how you feel. she didn’t invite any of us.
2697,Amy,"huh. but if i were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?"
2699,Amy,"wait, now i’m just some lousy maid of honour?"
652,Amy,sheldon.
654,Amy,i got you a little something.
2705,Amy,i think i can see my breath.
660,Amy,no problem.
664,Amy,"you don’t have to say good night to painting amy, ’cause she’s never leaving."
2712,Amy,i’d be lost without you.
2716,Amy,are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
2719,Amy,it’s happening.
2726,Amy,why don’t you want anyone to know?
2727,Amy,where did you get empty dove bar wrappers?
680,Amy,you have such a good heart.
681,Amy,come on.
682,Amy,we’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
2733,Amy,"hi. howard told me you were working late, so i brought dinner."
686,Amy,i’ll let you in on a little secret.
2734,Amy,i spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
2736,Amy,you really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
692,Amy,"well, this isn’t a crisis. why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
2743,Amy,"well, sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but i don’t think that’s happening."
2746,Amy,bert’s a geologist. 
2747,Amy,"oh, actually, we’re an hour late."
702,Amy,you gave me your word. you’re coming with me.
2751,Amy,i’m sure it’s just ’cause i’m dating sheldon.
704,Amy,"i think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. it’s like a vacation for your teeth."
2752,Amy,just the right idea at the right time.
706,Amy,thank you. that means a lot to me.
707,Amy,"sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? isn’t that a little rude?"
2757,Amy,bye.
711,Amy,the pretend boyfriend i invented to get my family off my back. it unravelled quickly when i couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
2760,Amy,"well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
2764,Amy,"so, technically, i’d be moving in with my boyfriend?"
2767,Amy,"sheldon, i understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
731,Amy,you’re hurting me.
732,Amy,before; now it’s you.
2779,Amy,good call. seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running.
2780,Amy,thank you.
738,Amy,"hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
2787,Amy,"sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
745,Amy,"oh, thank god. i’m still a maid of honour. "
746,Amy,this is kind of hot.
2793,Amy,comfy?
2797,Amy,hang on.
750,Amy,"with our friends moving forward in their relationships, i’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
752,Amy,i have devised an experiment that i believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
756,Amy,fine. there’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. why don’t you have a seat.
2805,Amy,"i’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
758,Amy,not even strawberry quik?
759,Amy,"oh, i know. i think it will go nicely with what i have prepared for dinner."
2808,Amy,can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
765,Amy,"no, no, no, this is not the wedding i wanted! i want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays the way you look tonight."
2814,Amy,i’m sorry for bringing this over here. 
2817,Amy,what?
2818,Amy,we sleep together once a year. you want other partners?
772,Amy,"excuse me, i’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
773,Amy,"oh, my gosh. i can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on google earth."
2826,Amy,maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
782,Amy,"no, i had a cover story, i told everyone it was herpes. so, how’s everything going with you and leonard?"
2831,Amy,"that was actually koothrappali, but i did let him spit it out in my hand."
2835,Amy,"oh, hi. hi."
797,Amy,i’m leaving.
798,Amy,you do?
800,Amy,"sheldon, that was beautiful."
2848,Amy,"there’s nothing to be afraid of, sheldon."
2851,Amy,"hi, stuart."
805,Amy,not just someday. in exactly four years. but don’t tell sheldon. he’s still a flight risk.
808,Amy,"can’t help ya, kid. whenever i’m around sheldon, i feel like my loins are on fire. in the good way. not the urinary tract infection way."
809,Amy,"well, i like it."
2857,Amy,we’re so sorry.
811,Amy,there might be a reason for that.
2859,Amy,maybe i can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
814,Amy,it’s complicated.
2864,Amy,did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis…
2865,Amy,it’s almost dinner time. you in the mood for anything?
818,Amy,hello?
820,Amy,i know. she’s yelling at me right now.
823,Amy,it’s so cute when she tries.
2873,Amy,"well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…"
2874,Amy,"or damp wall, just as bad."
2876,Amy,"i was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go."
2877,Amy,"well, he started to question it, but then i fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. please don’t say anything, i feel terrible about this."
830,Amy,he knows my last name. i’m his girlfriend. we have a contract and everything. i’ll send you a pdf.
2878,Amy,thanks.
839,Amy,"really? because just before you became my best friend, i did this all over your apartment."
842,Amy,"so says your prefrontal cortex. but meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to leonard, it must be because he’s desirable."
2891,Amy,whatever.
845,Amy,"me, too. but we’ll see him tomorrow."
2894,Amy,"i don’t know. it, it could be. "
848,Amy,yes.
850,Amy,now?
2900,Amy,what’s going on?
853,Amy,"all right, let’s keep it simple. how about darts?"
854,Amy,we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla and play real-life operation.
2906,Amy,i understand. i’ll leave you be.
863,Amy,question. do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
864,Amy,and my boyfriend?
865,Amy,then what’s your job?
2918,Amy,"it didn’t hurt, did it?"
2922,Amy,these cells come from both of us.
877,Amy,"sheldon, get in here."
2926,Amy,"well, i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit."
2931,Amy,aren’t you glad you participated in this?
2933,Amy,make a baby? what are you talking about?
2938,Amy,no. he was explicit. needlessly and freakishly explicit.
892,Amy,i feel like i’m in high school again.
2943,Amy,"sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
901,Amy,"yes. and so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. let’s try it again. everybody’s having fun. and action."
2954,Amy,"sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit."
910,Amy,"i’m not hungry. your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything."
2959,Amy,really?
913,Amy,star trek dvds? why would i want this?
2962,Amy,i can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
916,Amy,i feel like i’m five pounds lighter.
2965,Amy,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off.
2966,Amy,"you know what i mean. you were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
2969,Amy,"if we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
2970,Amy,"great, what’d you have in mind?"
2977,Amy,and you.
2978,Amy,to give to you.
937,Amy,"oh, my god,"
2986,Amy,what’s wrong?
2988,Amy,i’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. what is this?
941,Amy,you had my car towed.
2992,Amy,"you hate scotch tape, but you love scotch plaid. you are a mystery."
2993,Amy,"i guess, i guess we should stop."
2996,Amy,"well, should we, uh, head back up?"
2997,Amy,"oh, uh, i don’t know. sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
2998,Amy,uh.
2999,Amy,well.
956,Amy,"you, you want to rub something on my chest?"
3006,Amy,hold on. i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
963,Amy,see the stuff in my nose? rubber cement.
964,Amy,all right. i’ll tell him.
3013,Amy,"wait, what just happened?"
966,Amy,"oh, sheldon, am i glad you’re back. taking a turn for the worst. i think i’m going to need another bath."
3016,Amy,is this about the baby?
974,Amy,one second. i want to put on some music.
976,Amy,"oh, my."
3024,Amy,how’s bernadette?
3031,Amy,it was not a great trip.
985,Amy,thanks.
987,Amy,that is some low-hanging fruit.
3036,Amy,"thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
3038,Amy,"they haven’t said. anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
3044,Amy,"sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
997,Amy,"thank you, rajesh. he wants me, i’m good. we can go now."
3045,Amy,"we’re ignoring the fins, okay."
3049,Amy,"you know, i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. but, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone."
1005,Amy,seriously?
3053,Amy,"sheldon, i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were."
3058,Amy,"you and i are in a relationship. i help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
3062,Amy,really? you’re never gonna touch their baby?
1016,Amy,yeah.
1019,Amy,"it says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of thor."
3068,Amy,well sheldon always has his pants on. i don’t think i could pick his knees out of a line-up.
1021,Amy,"yeah, but, it can’t make decisions."
1024,Amy,hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
1025,Amy,yeah?
3079,Amy,"i don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
3080,Amy,hmm. then this is probably too many clothes.
3082,Amy,"sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?"
1035,Amy,"so, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?"
3086,Amy,i remember signing our first relationship agreement.
3087,Amy,"right, right. got it."
3088,Amy,"sheldon, what did you do?"
1041,Amy,"think about it, sheldon. i’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, i’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, i find cute as a button. what do you think?"
1043,Amy,see? you can’t. i’m gonna go see if leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
1048,Amy,"yes. i did good, right?"
1049,Amy,no.
1056,Amy,"then what the hell, sheldon? we have been going out for over two years, and i have been nothing but patient with you. i watch your dopey space movies. i signed your ridiculous contract. i even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. i am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. you give me one good reason why i can’t live here."
1059,Amy,you’re a coward.
1063,Amy,happy valentine’s day.
3114,Amy,"hey, you’re home early."
3116,Amy,"well, i’m really happy for you."
3117,Amy,i give up.
1071,Amy,"sheldon cooper, caltech university employee information?"
3120,Amy,"well, the bra under here ain’t beige."
1075,Amy,"hello? another medical emergency? what’s wrong with him now? i seriously doubt he was bitten by a chinese bird spider. how exactly does a bump feel asian? just put him on the phone. sheldon, i am not driving over there again. because i drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. yes, i still want to be your emergency contact. yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. i’m on my way. brain tumour would explain a lot."
3126,Amy,"i’m not sad. i mean, hello."
3127,Amy,what are you sad about?
3128,Amy,what feelings?
3129,Amy,come on. you’ve got so much to feel good about. you’ve got a great job now.
3135,Amy,"me, too."
3137,Amy,"hey, sheldon, i found a great restaurant for date night."
3138,Amy,"oh, an euler’s disk, fun."
1091,Amy,hooky? i’ve never played hooky in my life. my mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
3141,Amy,"oh, look. it’s bert, at the bar. we should go say hi."
1095,Amy,"oh, i was very clever, i did it in stages. at seven o’clock last night, i called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned i was going out for seafood. at nine thirty, i called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. at eleven thirty, i called and said i was throwing up like a fire hose. at twelve forty-five, i called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now i’m going to disneyland."
1096,Amy,"so, what are we gonna do first?"
3144,Amy,"hi, bert."
1100,Amy,then how do we decide?
3148,Amy,"sorry, i don’t have a list of defunct search engines that i miss."
3150,Amy,i’m so sorry.
1103,Amy,"sheldon, all snow white needs is one little kiss to wake up."
3155,Amy,our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
1108,Amy,"well, you said sheldon read it. why not ask him?"
3162,Amy,so?
1117,Amy,"you didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. and he cried because he was so proud of you."
1120,Amy,"if you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time."
1122,Amy,do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?
3172,Amy,why? are they naughty?
1125,Amy,you don’t say.
1126,Amy,is that a problem?
1127,Amy,"well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense."
1130,Amy,"of course it would. i’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, i can only raise your stock as a candidate."
3180,Amy,"well, i’m not going, but i do think it’s nice you want to."
1137,Amy,she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause.
3186,Amy,"sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying."
3189,Amy,"no, you’re not gonna tell them anything. you’re gonna stay out of it."
1142,Amy,"i’m sorry you’re upset. you know, sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this."
1144,Amy,"you know, i might be able to help you with this. there’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less."
1145,Amy,you sure about that?
3193,Amy,"sure, happy to."
3200,Amy,i’m not going with you to comic-con.
1156,Amy,and?
3209,Amy,"there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. for me, too. the first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
1163,Amy,"uh, well, when we were going through security, i got pulled out of line for a pat-down. the, uh, tsa agent got a little handsy. i may have broken her nose with my elbow."
3211,Amy,"well, this isn’t an easy time for him. he’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
3212,Amy,you ready to go?
1166,Amy,okay.
3215,Amy,no. i already asked.
3216,Amy,sheldon.
3217,Amy,sheldon.
1171,Amy,what?
1172,Amy,you don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.
3220,Amy,and don’t start thinking about it now.
3226,Amy,"i mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
1182,Amy,i kiss you on the lips.
1183,Amy,i remove your armour. what do you do?
3232,Amy,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on?
1187,Amy,and now he can talk. i want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
3235,Amy,"you know, when i was six, i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night, gorilla. maybe i was onto something."
3236,Amy,"you know, i like harp lessons, but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. what are you working on?"
3237,Amy,"wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
1191,Amy,"maybe next week, we could all get together."
1192,Amy,ignore him. he’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think i understand the severity of your social anxiety.
1194,Amy,"rajesh, i thought lucy was coming."
1201,Amy,"which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation."
1204,Amy,so what happened? how’d it go?
3253,Amy,i don’t know where we went wrong.
1206,Amy,and why would no one blame me?
1207,Amy,"well, it sounds like you’re saying that i could do better than sheldon."
3255,Amy,"i can hear your face talking, so we’re even."
1209,Amy,and your husband is extremely howard. what’s your point?
3261,Amy,we’re finally making progress. i wish we could do it without fighting.
3264,Amy,there’s only one clear choice.
1219,Amy,then what does tweepadock mean?
1222,Amy,what?
1224,Amy,you’re being ridiculous.
3275,Amy,"incredible. sheldon, i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but i, i was wrong."
1235,Amy,"sheldon, your fight’s with leonard. penny’s got nothing to do…"
1238,Amy,"fyi, i had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
3286,Amy,you’re welcome. how is it?
1242,Amy,stop that. penny is not a liability.
1243,Amy,maybe we pick names out of a hat.
1244,Amy,"i did them all the time as a kid. as my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. she was full of fun lies like that."
3291,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
1255,Amy,"oh, oh, that’s good. then this would be "
1256,Amy,to the neil mobile.
3305,Amy,what are you looking at?
1258,Amy,they’re coming to america… ♪
1264,Amy,"she got the way to move me, honey."
3314,Amy,hey.
1267,Amy,it was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
3315,Amy,what smells so good?
1271,Amy,so what can i do for you?
1272,Amy,really?
3319,Amy,where did you get it?
1274,Amy,of course i’m in.
3322,Amy,"well, what do you want me to do?"
3325,Amy,"you said juggling was dumb, too."
3326,Amy,"sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
3327,Amy,"well, if you honestly…"
3329,Amy,i made you tea.
3332,Amy,so?
1285,Amy,"so, you’re okay with this?"
3334,Amy,"well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
1287,Amy,"sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
3337,Amy,"you know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
1290,Amy,i’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
1291,Amy,"wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?"
1292,Amy,i don’t mind. i’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
3347,Amy,i guess. and he’ll have you and leonard right across the hall the whole time.
3352,Amy,"no occasion, i just wanted to do something nice for you."
3357,Amy,"that is true, i have said that."
1310,Amy,really? what tipped you off?
1318,Amy,"i like you, too."
3367,Amy,"i know, but what if sheldon…"
1320,Amy,"could be anything. last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. the time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. still can’t believe i didn’t make the cut."
1321,Amy,"oh, i love that."
1322,Amy,i don’t think the smithsonian’s gonna want your marker. 
1323,Amy,"sheldon, i’m so proud of you."
1324,Amy,what’s next?
3378,Amy,"okay, the car is waiting. do you want to walk me downstairs?"
1332,Amy,"you know, sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
3384,Amy,uh-huh.
1337,Amy,sheldon.
3387,Amy,got it.
3388,Amy,good thinking.
1345,Amy,"sheldon, come on."
3394,Amy,"in fact, that’s when i started to really miss you."
3395,Amy,did i? are you gonna teach me a lesson?
1350,Amy,"from what i saw the other day, i could understand why he and some people might find you…"
3398,Amy,sounds like a big night.
3400,Amy,who’s he?
1353,Amy,this is fun. i’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications i’m allergic to.
3409,Amy,"i don’t know. might be the new jersey talking, but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
3410,Amy,"yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde olympic swimmer."
3414,Amy,she’s what?
1367,Amy,not even close.
1373,Amy,seriously?
1382,Amy,"is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"
1383,Amy,"ding, ding, ding. we have a winner."
1384,Amy,happy thanksgiving.
1385,Amy,sheldon.
3430,Amy,"you know, can i borrow that movie? those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
3432,Amy,"this is maid of honour amy farrah fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
3438,Amy,we’re here.
1391,Amy,"broad shoulders, good hair."
1395,Amy,thank you.
1396,Amy,sheldon.
3455,Amy,how dare you go on the internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia?
3460,Amy,"sheldon, what’s wrong?"
1413,Amy,can i give you a ride to the airport?
3466,Amy,"we’re just friends, what are you sayin’?"
1424,Amy,"here’s another one. penny, if it weren’t for sheldon you never would have met comic book legend stan lee."
1429,Amy,yay.
1431,Amy,"well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew."
1442,Amy,did you hold the baby?
1449,Amy,why?
1451,Amy,"well, that makes sense. the prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…"
1458,Amy,hello.
1459,Amy,he’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
1460,Amy,"it’s exhausting. do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy, knock-knock-knock, amy?"
1472,Amy,what do i do? i don’t want to hurt his feelings.
1475,Amy,penny really quit the cheesecake factory?
1482,Amy,don’t say that. 
1487,Amy,"well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?"
1488,Amy,"okay, i don’t have time for this. i’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
1489,Amy,really? you would do that?
1498,Amy,"aw. drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
1500,Amy,gosh.
1501,Amy,i think i have you both beat. imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
1508,Amy,i propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in napa valley.
1522,Amy,it’s feeling like it never will.
1524,Amy,i don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
1526,Amy,"oh, give it a rest."
1534,Amy,"okay, have fun."
1535,Amy,really? i do.
1544,Amy,"i think if i were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it."
1545,Amy,"i think you’d be smart enough to see that, too."
1550,Amy,"damn it, i got cocky."
1555,Amy,really?
1558,Amy,whatever happened with your online dating?
1561,Amy,that’s true. do whatever you want.
1563,Amy,"oh, she’s cute. and smart. phi beta kappa."
1569,Amy,i’m not gonna pretend to be you.
1580,Amy,are we still going to go to that chaucer reading friday?
1593,Amy,"hey, i won the nobel prize in physiology, then i used the money to buy stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so sheldon would pay attention to me. not the worst idea."
1594,Amy,"what does your card say, bernadette?"
1604,Amy,"oh, my gosh."
1613,Amy,"well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat."
1620,Amy,you’re welcome.
1621,Amy,"uh, it’s date night. aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?"
1623,Amy,"i’m proud of you, sheldon."
1632,Amy,"how about this? i’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome."
1642,Amy,maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
1643,Amy,i hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
1645,Amy,"come on, let’s get you to bed. you’ve had a lot to drink."
1653,Amy,"oh, no. i mean, this is weird right now."
1661,Amy,"well, i was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, i wanted to make it up to you."
1662,Amy,watching your old friend?
1666,Amy,and watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?
1670,Amy,i wonder why that is.
1673,Amy,that’s cute.
1675,Amy,my mom made it up as an alternative to the girl scouts. she didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
1676,Amy,"oh, i went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
1679,Amy,should we do something for her?
1683,Amy,atomic magnets?
1691,Amy,"and if it turns out you don’t, you and i could live together."
1703,Amy,how could you let him go?
1714,Amy,sure.
1719,Amy,yes.
1729,Amy,"measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. you like that, don’t you? that’s right, say my name."
1741,Amy,"close enough. um, i was just calling to see what you were up tonight. thought maybe we could hit up color me mine, maybe sneak in some pinot greej. whatevs."
1744,Amy,"tonight. you, me, color me mine. maybe we sneak in some pinot, make it color me wine."
1751,Amy,"it’s better than hot, it’s binding."
1752,Amy,you are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
1756,Amy,"it’s a good thing i’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire."
1759,Amy,"they developed the relationship closeness inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour."
1762,Amy,"no, we’re sorry. we never should have been comparing relationships in the first place."
1774,Amy,you’re right. cheers.
1782,Amy,"i’ll check my underpants. i’m so excited, i think i peed."
1785,Amy,but they’re called fairly manilow.
1794,Amy,"look at us out, while penny’s in the room studying."
1799,Amy,"no, no, it’s okay. i was born with it. if you put a double-a battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
1805,Amy,"okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. here, here, i’m gonna quiz you. i’m gonna quiz you. i got your notes. i got your notes. i got your notes. if you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club."
1808,Amy,"you know when you bend over, i can see down your shirt?"
1809,Amy,"most universities have them. when i was an undergrad, i spent three days in one pledging a sorority."
1814,Amy,"okay, just checking."
1815,Amy,anything else?
1817,Amy,11 minutes. that’s longer than i thought.
1818,Amy,do you really need me to transcribe this?
1826,Amy,"well, i’m really sorry, but i think it’s for the best. you want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine."
1831,Amy,but it was bad publicity.
1843,Amy,"dr. lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?"
1849,Amy,"no, but i was on clean-up crew."
1850,Amy,"no, it was okay. the dj let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. whenever i see a bucket of dirty water, i still hear lady in red."
1860,Amy,you’re making me worry. what’s going on?
1892,Amy,and i’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
1897,Amy,i know i was thinking that. is this a show on flags or mind reading?
1900,Amy,you said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
1902,Amy,"and, yes, even shed a tear or two."
1903,Amy,how many times do i have to say i’m sorry?
1906,Amy,"then who did sew it, hmm?"
1914,Amy,"if you’re not up to hosting christmas dinner, i’m happy to do it. you can even bring your father."
1916,Amy,you’re going.
1921,Amy,you won.
1923,Amy,"oh, you heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good."
1926,Amy,"no, i love it."
1932,Amy,"one person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
1933,Amy,"sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight."
1934,Amy,i will literally race you to the car.
1947,Amy,"i promised myself, if i ever got friends, i’d do whatever they said. really, i’m lucky you found me before a cult did."
1961,Amy,"look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
1968,Amy,maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
1969,Amy,fine. how was your day?
1981,Amy,please?
1984,Amy,what is it?
1992,Amy,"it’s not about me and sheldon. it’s about a young woman in the 1800s named amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named cooper she falls in love with."
1993,Amy,no.
1996,Amy,"he’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. it’s called good writing. and wishful thinking."
2022,Amy,one of us would have taken you in.
2031,Amy,i think we’re safe.
2032,Amy,the two of us could do it.
2042,Amy,"well, if i don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. and if i’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. the answer’s son."
30720,Raj,i don’t think we’re going to do that.
30725,Raj,what were you doing with priya?
32775,Raj,"okay. if i make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
32776,Raj,yes.
32777,Raj,"i didn’t crash it, okay? my playlist was too up-tempo, i got light-headed and i fell off. okay. it all comes down to this."
30727,Raj,"excuse me, i think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!"
32781,Raj,i meant a hindu temple.
32782,Raj,"dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians."
32783,Raj,"yeah, it’s pretty great."
32785,Raj,"religion is a very personal thing. i do go to temple, i just, i don’t talk about it."
30738,Raj,"oh, yeah? what’s that look like?"
32787,Raj,that is so offensive. does everything you know about hinduism come from indiana jones?
32791,Raj,all right. shall we?
30746,Raj,"i’m in this country legally, you know."
30749,Raj,"please don’t send me back to india, it’s so crowded. it’s like the whole country is one endless comic-con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, indian guy."
32799,Raj,i may not be liking this game so much.
32800,Raj,"you know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. it’s not strange."
30756,Raj,"oh, yeah."
30764,Raj,"hey, guys, bad news. i just did a quick calculation. given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats."
30765,Raj,"oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in."
32814,Raj,no. you have to read it how dr. angus mcdougal of the university of edinburgh would. this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
32817,Raj,see? better with the accent.
32822,Raj,our pleasure.
32827,Raj,"no, if we got captain reynolds from firefly to do a signing at stuart’s store, that would be amazing."
32829,Raj,"what? the, the guy who plays jon snow was a jerk. we still watch game of thrones."
32832,Raj,"don’t know why he’s so grumpy. i got mistaken for that guy in life of pi once, and i’m still floating."
30784,Raj,i do appreciate that.
32834,Raj,"are you sure you’re not him? uh, you can tell us. we’re scientists, not crazy fanboys."
30786,Raj,yeah. like his haircut material.
30787,Raj,no. i got them all cut.
32840,Raj,"ah, it’s good enough for facebook."
30793,Raj,"no, you wouldn’t. you’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. my only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people i hired to be my living chess set."
30795,Raj,you know it’s been more than a year since i’ve even kissed a girl?
32844,Raj,he’s hanging in there.
32845,Raj,"yeah. mrs. wolowitz was pretty special. when i first moved to america, howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought i was the gardener."
30796,Raj,"oh, grow up. i was lying. i lie all the time. nobody wants to kiss me."
30797,Raj,where?
32849,Raj,"yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
30802,Raj,hey.
30803,Raj,he never touched my telescope.
30804,Raj,i did shut up. now you shut up.
32855,Raj,"i don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text."
32864,Raj,"it’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
32865,Raj,"so, where’s your roommate tonight?"
30818,Raj,"well, type two diabetes runs in my family. the thought of losing a toe…"
30820,Raj,are you crazy?
30821,Raj,no. but it’s a stupid test.
30823,Raj,"all right, i will."
32874,Raj,she’s gonna know i was looking in it.
30828,Raj,"okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?"
32885,Raj,"you know, it, it’s bad enough that i have to deal with this…"
30838,Raj,"you crimson coward! oh, leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips."
32891,Raj,"come on, think back. it would really help if you had."
32893,Raj,"well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and i was just angry at myself."
32895,Raj,no. just the drawer.
32901,Raj,"me, too. oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."
30858,Raj,"you know, if i made more money, i could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."
32914,Raj,you could play ping-pong for it.
32916,Raj,what?
32917,Raj,"we are. we are. oh, no. what a terrible serve. sorry, brother."
30869,Raj,no. the moment has passed.
30876,Raj,why?
30878,Raj,"hey, leonard, sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key."
32928,Raj,"wow, so you’re not curious at all?"
30881,Raj,i did. you said no bridget jones.
32931,Raj,"you know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit."
30883,Raj,"ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their flickr account."
30888,Raj,what?
30890,Raj,"aw, i’m gonna miss you. are you going with him?"
32941,Raj,hey.
30896,Raj,"oh, no!"
32949,Raj,you should have told him to mind his own business.
30901,Raj,"excuse me, bernadette. i have to hear it from him."
30902,Raj,"got it. take care. i guess i have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."
30905,Raj,"here’s what i wonder about zombies.  what happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? they can’t starve to death, they’re already dead."
32957,Raj,"okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the golden record on voyager, were heavily criticized."
32962,Raj,"okay, let’s talk about something else."
30917,Raj,it’s koothrappali. i have to tinkle.
30918,Raj,"oh, don’t be such gloomy gusses. look at the size of these shrimp! at what point do we start calling them lobsters?"
30925,Raj,no!
32974,Raj,"it wasn’t, so are you in?"
32975,Raj,"okay, i think we should do it right now."
32978,Raj,"hang on. building on what leonard said, no one built on what i said."
30931,Raj,"some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. my point is, you can’t go out with leonard."
32981,Raj,"well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."
30939,Raj,"nope. gates gave a speech at the university. sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in africa, you could have put a little more thought into windows vista.”"
30942,Raj,i still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
32994,Raj,"no, daddy, no. there are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. i know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week."
32997,Raj,"hey, guys."
30957,Raj,hi!
33006,Raj,"well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. let’s talk about you."
30959,Raj,"hold on. i’m talking to an orc under the bridge in thunder bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things."
33010,Raj,"you guys don’t have to go to the trouble. i’m back in the money now, i can just buy another helicopter."
30963,Raj,"sheldon, what if he gets his internet from his cable company? he could lose his hbo and all their delightful original programming."
30964,Raj,"okay, i see where this is going. fine, i’ll have sex with him."
33013,Raj,check.
33014,Raj,"it’s my father, you jerks. hello, daddy."
30967,Raj,there’s no reason to worry.
30972,Raj,"oh, come on, man. bros before… my sister."
33022,Raj,how old is this jell-o?
30975,Raj,very nice. you lie to my sister.
30979,Raj,i took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
33029,Raj,"no, no, no. hey, you should totally get it. in fact, i’ll buy it for you."
30983,Raj,legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
33032,Raj,"she and i were supposed to watch the new avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. so i said, what else do you want to do? she said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave."
33033,Raj,what difference does it make?
33039,Raj,"oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and elizabeth mcnulty, who apparently died when she was the same age i am."
33040,Raj,"so does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are."
33041,Raj,"of ghosts, no. of you, little bit."
33042,Raj,i think we should talk.
30997,Raj,yeah. good or devastating.
33047,Raj,didn’t even crack the top ten.
31004,Raj,"me, too. good times."
33057,Raj,whatever. it would have been nice to hear it from you.
33058,Raj,how do you know?
33062,Raj,"not yet, this is fun. ooh, i know. i’d let her free my willy. where you going?"
31019,Raj,"excuse me. i’m going to go wander the streets alone. invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  i forgot my windbreaker. it’s chilly."
33069,Raj,"this van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, richard feynman."
31025,Raj,nothing rhymes with orange. it’s probably lonely.
33074,Raj,we don’t have any of those.
33077,Raj,when did you learn how to change a tyre?
31029,Raj,"no, thank you. i’m fine."
33080,Raj,it’s called lamaze breathing. it helps you push.
33082,Raj,of course. all we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
33085,Raj,i had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
31038,Raj,"okay, let’s see if this drug works."
31040,Raj,india.
33098,Raj,"okay, so it’s a, it’s a david and goliath story. it’s about man against god. it’s called hammer and whip, the untold story of thor versus indiana jones."
33099,Raj,"okay, i don’t have it all worked out yet, but i was thinking something like, um, oh, indy, oh, indy, the skies are so windy. is that a flying man with a killer bod? wait, that’s no man, it’s a norse god."
31050,Raj,"oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places."
31052,Raj,i’m taking a stroll and i’m sporting wood.
33102,Raj,"hey, remember the ark of the covenant?"
33104,Raj,"runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but i couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder."
31057,Raj,one of them broke up with you. do you really want her telling the other one why?
33106,Raj,cute? it’s not cute. cute is children dressed as vegetables.
33108,Raj,"you can dance to this. um, uh, uh, thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
33109,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it."
31060,Raj,like what?
31063,Raj,so you’d do a striptease?
31065,Raj,"well, i don’t think you have to worry about penny telling my sister that."
33115,Raj,that is so not true.
31067,Raj,what if she wasn’t kidding?
33122,Raj,are you?
31074,Raj,leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. can i stay here tonight?
33124,Raj,we can still be swashers.
31078,Raj,"oh, don’t bother. i’ll just sleep in leonard’s room."
33127,Raj,look at us. we’re like the rockettes.
31079,Raj,"well, he’s in my bed. why can’t i be in his?"
31083,Raj,i was sleeping.
33132,Raj,"whoa, whoa. walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work."
31084,Raj,"well, i would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. and the memory of gene roddenberry."
33136,Raj,hello.
31089,Raj,can i bring girls here?
31092,Raj,when did you take my blood?
33147,Raj,"oh, no. at home. the servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. i wish i knew their names."
33148,Raj,"oh. hey, high five."
33149,Raj,"so, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
31099,Raj,it’s not a big thing. just think of me as a brown martha stewart.
33151,Raj,hey.
31100,Raj,i’m the new homo in town. that came out wrong.
33156,Raj,"it’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have."
31109,Raj,"what’s wrong with me, penny?"
33158,Raj,so what’s up?
33159,Raj,you’re not wrong about fruit stripe. i was always a hubba bubba man.
33160,Raj,"hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
33170,Raj,not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. we really have led full lives.
33171,Raj,"maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. you know what they say, opposites attract."
31123,Raj,"i will. hey, bernadette?"
33173,Raj,forty-five.
31129,Raj,you can’t ruin a friendship with sex. that’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
33178,Raj,answer it.
31131,Raj,"well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense."
33180,Raj,have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to siri without pressing any buttons?
33182,Raj,nice try. it only recognizes my voice.
31138,Raj,can i say i ruined you for white men?
31139,Raj,"okay, just the candle thing."
33192,Raj,they exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
33194,Raj,"it’s not a big deal. it just took, like, five minutes to set up."
31149,Raj,"oh, yeah. this is one good-looking panini."
33201,Raj,"dude, if i was wearing a bra, i’d throw it at your head right now."
33202,Raj,okay. i posted it.
31153,Raj,like this?
33219,Raj,"guys, they’re gonna sell out."
33222,Raj,tonight’s the night.
31174,Raj,i worked on it all night. use it.
33224,Raj,i can’t believe sheldon gave this up.
33225,Raj,"oh, did you hear from wil?"
31176,Raj,you’re blowing this for me!
31178,Raj,"really? ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
33231,Raj,"leonard, i, i’m scared again."
33232,Raj,i don’t think i can walk right now.
31187,Raj,what? why?
33239,Raj,pushover.
33240,Raj,"uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced."
33249,Raj,it could be a trans-neptunian object.
31202,Raj,penny?
31203,Raj,"i just got her a couple of things. she gives me things, too."
33255,Raj,you dream different than me.
33260,Raj,"i learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you."
33262,Raj,we haven’t settled on anything yet.
31220,Raj,"nothing, i’m fine."
31221,Raj,no. 
33271,Raj,"huh. okay. as long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, i’m in."
31224,Raj,you should’ve seen your face.
31225,Raj,he’s probably right.
33283,Raj,that’s very mature of you.
33288,Raj,"she built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. you know what i saw you do today? eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."
33291,Raj,"it was a classic western set in the post-jurassic period, and it changed my life."
33292,Raj,"oh, i see you’re reading saga."
31244,Raj,a total loser. obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
31253,Raj,"yeah, it’s also a wand."
33302,Raj,so?
33303,Raj,i wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
31255,Raj,you’re so full of it.
33308,Raj,"all right. i’ve made up my mind. i’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that i’m in a relationship."
31260,Raj,what’s that one?
31261,Raj,"hey, i won a newcomb medal, too."
31265,Raj,what’s that?
33318,Raj,"okay. that hurts a little, but okay."
33321,Raj,he lied about the cream cheese. he ate the whole thing. i saw him.
33324,Raj,i will.
31276,Raj,because she’s great in everything.
31278,Raj,i guess it didn’t go well.
33327,Raj,"oh, i am, i am. i, i guess i’m still wondering if emily and i are right for each other."
31281,Raj,"i stopped on the way to work. hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
33330,Raj,"yeah, i think so. do you have any advice?"
31282,Raj,"grab a corner. whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? savour the moment."
33332,Raj,yeah.
31287,Raj,i will see you gentlemen later.
31294,Raj,i’d like you to call me sexy.
31295,Raj,okay.
33344,Raj,"because instead of being in the telescope room, i was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays."
33345,Raj,"hey, bud."
33346,Raj,"if it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in december, congratulations, you’re the first one."
33350,Raj,"i know, you could ask bernadette for a raise in your allowance."
33352,Raj,"yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
31306,Raj,thank you.  
31307,Raj,"um, expedition 31 will launch this spring to the international space station. crew members will include commander tom ‘tombo’ johnson, astronaut mike ‘supernova’ novacelik and payload specialist howard wolowitz."
31310,Raj,are you not looking at me? i am brown dynamite. why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
33361,Raj,look at that. you’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
31313,Raj,maybe your nickname should be brown dynamite.
31316,Raj,"ooh, ooh! what about we make your astronaut nickname howard “buzz” wolowitz?"
33365,Raj,"you mean, some guy in a lame suit?"
33366,Raj,"hey, so what was adam west like on the phone?"
31322,Raj,"okay, uh, what if we make rocket man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, i’ll call you and they’ll hear it. plant the seed."
33375,Raj,"i know. i mean, do i open it? do i return it?"
31327,Raj,upsilon?
31328,Raj,"hey, guys, guys, president siebert is headed this way."
31330,Raj,really? what was i doing to your neck last night while you were playing x-box?
31331,Raj,"no hi, raj? no how are you, raj? just straight to where’s the other white guy?"
33383,Raj,"oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me."
31336,Raj,like what?
33385,Raj,"maybe you’re right. wow, i am easy to manipulate.  oh, guys, it’s emily. what should i do?"
33388,Raj,"maybe, maybe."
33389,Raj,"i’m sorry, i seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how i feel about this."
31343,Raj,how about you decide this with rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock?
31350,Raj,so?
33399,Raj,"yes. indeed. absolutely. indubitably. i’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and i know it. so, uh, when do you want to meet up?"
33400,Raj,"right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, i’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. but it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything."
31351,Raj,"payload specialist howard wolowitz is requested to report to the nasa johnson space center, houston, texas, for astronaut training monday eight a.m."
33402,Raj,any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook?
31354,Raj,"you could go to my guy. he’s at juan-juan in beverly hills. they bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. it’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like tony danza."
31358,Raj,"yeah. start saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
31361,Raj,woo-hoo!
31363,Raj,"here you go. i’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
33416,Raj,"okay. that’s cool. i guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. so, see ya."
31371,Raj,i’ll let you know.
31376,Raj,"listen, uh, there’s something i want to talk to you about. i, i wasn’t ready until now, but i think it’s time."
33425,Raj,busting you.
33427,Raj,no spoilers. no spoilers.
33429,Raj,"bernie, i just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in los angeles. i know my favourite, but i’d love to hear what you think."
31383,Raj,it’s different. you’re people don’t worship lox.
31388,Raj,please have a seat.  i’m thinking double wedding!
33437,Raj,"well, if that’s the case, is there anything i can do to help?"
31393,Raj,"okay, what page are you on?"
31397,Raj,i’m not gay.
33446,Raj,"well, that’s just batman."
33447,Raj,"uh, actually i’m seeing both of them."
31403,Raj,"hey, uh, can i run something by you? it’s about lakshmi."
33452,Raj,"you are, because dating two women, i mean, i can’t even remember the last time i slept in my own apartment. i wake up and i’m like, am i at claire’s or am i at emily’s? is there a third girl i’ve forgotten about? like, where am i?"
33457,Raj,"i’m sorry, have i been complaining about it too much?"
33459,Raj,i never said that.
31414,Raj,"so, while i’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, i’m supposed to just be alone."
31421,Raj,"that’s incredible. oh, here, break out the math."
31422,Raj,are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
33477,Raj,funny how that worked out.
31429,Raj,i thought he might be a little more excited.
33480,Raj,"it’s, it’s beautiful."
31432,Raj,"anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about howard’s bachelor party."
31433,Raj,"i’ve been doing some research on strippers. one agency i spoke to, said i could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs."
33484,Raj,"nothing to worry about. people meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. i met bon jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. turns out, total sweetheart."
33485,Raj,"boy, it wasn’t this hard with bon jovi. i said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that."
33487,Raj,"yeah, i know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma."
31441,Raj,"hear, hear."
31445,Raj,"oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the sailor moon costume at comic-con?"
33494,Raj,"zack, this is my friend claire."
31457,Raj,"oh, please. i don’t remember the episode of star trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
33506,Raj,"yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do."
31458,Raj,you’re nervous? i’ve been stress-eating for four days. look at me. i’m wearing my fat pants.
31464,Raj,"oh, thanks, man."
33515,Raj,is there a window around here we don’t know about?
31472,Raj,i wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
33521,Raj,"oh, if it’s even the u.s. military. it could be foreign military pretending to be american."
33522,Raj,i also love the enemies of america.
31474,Raj,"hey, guys."
31481,Raj,sorry i started without you. i’m a little nervous. it’s been a long time since i’ve been on a date.
33534,Raj,may i ask what this is about?
31491,Raj,"well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?"
31492,Raj,"no, thank you."
33541,Raj,"oh, i take it back, don’t mention me."
33544,Raj,you know that hurts my feelings.
31499,Raj,"oh, penny. that’s ridiculous. you know you love him. you, you look him in the eyes and you say it. "
31500,Raj,"oh come on, you know you want to say it. say it. say you love him. say it!"
33549,Raj,yeah. this military guy showed up at howard’s door. he was terrifying.
33553,Raj,wail till i snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
33554,Raj,"fine, i’ll put it on facebook like a caveman."
31505,Raj,all right. great.
31507,Raj,perfect for the night i’m having. thank you.
31514,Raj,"uh, thank you for the drink."
33564,Raj,he is so afraid of his feelings.
33567,Raj,"well, i don’t mind. oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
31520,Raj,"hey, stuart, come on in."
31523,Raj,"so, what are you guys doing later? stuart and i were thinking of going out for a drink."
33572,Raj,"you didn’t think i was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here i am."
33573,Raj,"well, in the sound of music, julie andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start."
31527,Raj,"hey, you already got a girlfriend. i call dibs."
33577,Raj,"oh, and did they have kids?"
31529,Raj,"has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?"
31534,Raj,"okay, the nasa web site says howard’s final descent has begun."
33585,Raj,sorry. sorry.
33587,Raj,okay. how thelma and louise of us.
31540,Raj,"oh, yeah, we hang out all the time."
31543,Raj,"oh, howard, it’s still our thing. come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket."
31544,Raj,we’ll switch. you’ll come sit with me after intermission.
31545,Raj,"okay, uh, will i get to see you tomorrow?"
31546,Raj,"hey, stuart, i see you’re getting ready for your halloween party."
33595,Raj,no.
31547,Raj,would you like me to help? i do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
31551,Raj,on sesame seed bunzillas.
31555,Raj,do you have a preference?
33605,Raj,"what? this is not a problem, okay? if you don’t want to know, i don’t have to tell you."
33608,Raj,hello?
31560,Raj,no.
33613,Raj,hmm. they must have left the tub on. good thing i stopped by. ah. aaaaah! what are you doing here?
31565,Raj,"try to keep up, howard, i’m killing it."
31567,Raj,dude! i was about to bollywood this bitch.
29520,Raj,"you mean, you don’t."
33619,Raj,so why don’t you get it fixed?
31571,Raj,"dude, my accent is brilliant.  hey, my snow-white american friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese."
33623,Raj,nobody does. i was embarrassed so i didn’t say anything.
33624,Raj,"yeah, yeah, a little."
31579,Raj,so don’t do it.
31580,Raj,then don’t do it.
33629,Raj,why?
33630,Raj,yeah?
33631,Raj,wait till you see the crib we found.
33632,Raj,"yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. i wouldn’t even call it a crib, i’d call it a fortress of solitude for babies."
29537,Raj,what’s the matter.
31583,Raj,what are you drawing over there?
33637,Raj,"no, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. here. give me those."
33638,Raj,yes.
33639,Raj,"you have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride."
29544,Raj,why don’t you just have robert e. lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh.
31592,Raj,"boy, what i wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."
29546,Raj,oh dear.
29548,Raj,"nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. "
31596,Raj,"i can’t do anything right for you, can i?"
31598,Raj,"howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. that’s not okay."
33647,Raj,"i’m not really a part of this, so i’m just gonna dig in."
33651,Raj,do you like living with her?
33652,Raj,"oh, my god, i just got it. fun onions, funyuns. hold on. is that a wobble? yes. that’s definitely a gravitational wobble."
31603,Raj,are you sure?
33654,Raj,it’s a gravitational wobble. it could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
33657,Raj,"oh, well, nice to meet you."
29563,Raj,we could cut it into thirds. 
31611,Raj,maybe. it’s a prime number. encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
29565,Raj,"can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in india, there’s an indian starving right here. "
29566,Raj,uurgh.
31613,Raj,"really? well, oh, okay, one mystery solved."
31614,Raj,"come on, we’re smart guys. we can figure this out."
29570,Raj,i can’t see him.
31619,Raj,"hey, hey. feelings."
29576,Raj,"may i present, live from new delhi, dr and mrs v. m. koothrappali. "
31626,Raj,i don’t know.
33675,Raj,this is fun. i have never cleaned a toilet before.
31629,Raj,"sheldon, we’re really sorry."
29583,Raj,what is it papa.
31631,Raj,"yeah, well, i know how to make your egg salad now."
33681,Raj,that’s a cute age. they can do so many things.
31633,Raj,"no, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. mummies and zombies are the exact same thing."
33683,Raj,"maybe there are other things we have in common. come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
29587,Raj,spring wedding?
31635,Raj,congratulations. does it have that new car smell?
29590,Raj,"sorry, mommy, papa, but with all due respect i really can’t go through…"
33687,Raj,"okay. i’ll leave. but just know, every time i come in here, i’ll be thinking of you."
29591,Raj,i don’t believe it.
31638,Raj,i didn’t pick up on that. that’s a nice touch.
31640,Raj,calm down. howard has something he wants to say to you.
31643,Raj,an we change the subject? spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
31644,Raj,"i know, but that sounds anti-semitic. anyway, i was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. the theme, movies that killed their franchises."
29598,Raj,"if i don’t call her, i won’t hear the end of it from my parents."
31647,Raj,"if you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. do you know how many beef wellingtons i made by myself before i invited you guys over? i’ll give you a hint. you can see them here, here and here."
31649,Raj,"you got this, buddy."
33699,Raj,"isabella. isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
33701,Raj,"well, prepare to be mortified. i let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because i do. also, i know they’re pretty, but i’m scared of butterflies."
33702,Raj,come on. what do you say? let me make it up to you.
29608,Raj,and it’s about to tell my parents that i’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta. 
31657,Raj,"wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? because if you’ve got one, i need it bad. get in here with your rod and give it to me."
29610,Raj,"you’re right. i… i am talking to you. hello penny, how are you?"
33707,Raj,over half a million dollars.
29612,Raj,overdo what? happiness? freedom? this warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
33711,Raj,i laughed because the guy was leonard.
33713,Raj,then the robot uprising has begun.
29620,Raj,"but you’re a dentist, he’s nuts. "
31675,Raj,"no, not really."
33727,Raj,"yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local montessori school for the new arrival."
31680,Raj,"sometimes i get so lonely, i sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then i put it in my right hand and pretend i’m holding hands with another person."
33729,Raj,"well i don’t know if you realize this, but i bought that crib."
29634,Raj,i’m not an alcoholic.
29635,Raj,"it was just this one time, papa, i swear. "
29636,Raj,"but papa, please…."
29637,Raj,please wait until i get into the hall. 
31685,Raj,"now that i know she doesn’t like me, i’m kind of into her."
33735,Raj,at least my nose is naturally brown.
29640,Raj,i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. but that’s something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. 
33739,Raj,"team baby, go."
33740,Raj,"all right, hold on. i’m gonna drive like we do in india. get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
29646,Raj,shotgun.
31695,Raj,huh. that is so strange. human resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? i have a problem here.
33744,Raj,"you see, i was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so i took a peek."
31698,Raj,i feel like i’ve been called down to the principal’s office. although i wouldn’t mind if brown sugar suspended me. from a sex swing. this may have been a mistake.
33747,Raj,"you’ll be happy i did. okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. you wanted to make an entrance. i get it. and here’s your daddy. when he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
31700,Raj,"if you weren’t screwing around with sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening."
33751,Raj,"well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
33754,Raj,no. people just keep kicking me out everywhere i go.
31709,Raj,phasers on the borg! charlie’s angels.
29664,Raj,thank you. 
31713,Raj,what is wrong with people? why don’t they stop?
31715,Raj,insurance is gonna buy you a new car. it’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
31718,Raj,great. we can still make it to comic-con.
33768,Raj,"guys, she’s my goddaughter, i think i’ll know when i see her. that one."
29672,Raj,"alright, why don’t we do it your way then? we’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
33771,Raj,"you know, in india when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. not always, sometimes we’d leave."
31724,Raj,"if it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party."
31725,Raj,"so, i found this web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. how awesome is that?"
29678,Raj,"you know, i kind of feel bad about what we did to him. "
33777,Raj,"yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from walking dead into a lullaby. "
33779,Raj,"i know. blue shag, what were you thinking?"
33781,Raj,"hang on. no offence to her father, but he’s not an mit trained engineer. thinking and building is what you do."
29689,Raj,"you know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played tv’s blossom. she got a phd in neuroscience or something. "
29690,Raj,how about the girl from the wonder years? 
33791,Raj,"hold on, i don’t think she was impressed."
33793,Raj,she said she didn’t want to see me any more and i found that insulting.
29699,Raj,fifteen seconds.
29700,Raj,"ten, nine, eight…"
31749,Raj,here you go.
29702,Raj,four.
31750,Raj,"what, you don’t say thank you?"
31752,Raj,cool. did she discover a cure for something?
33801,Raj,maybe i could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
29706,Raj,"congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
33804,Raj,we are going to find out.
31760,Raj,"well, i, i really couldn’t. but, uh, i’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst."
31761,Raj,"that would be lovely. thank you.  mrs. wolowitz, uh, are you okay?"
31762,Raj,"i, uh, i suppose i could stay for some dessert."
31763,Raj,sure.
29718,Raj,"also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 pasadena. "
31767,Raj,"yeah. uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of rockford files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing i know, she was tucking me into your bed."
31769,Raj,"oh, boy. breakfast."
31771,Raj,"oh, howard, stop."
33820,Raj,what did she say?
31775,Raj,"i’m trapped. my clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. i think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. what do i do?"
31776,Raj,"come on, howard, help me."
33826,Raj,"i appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, i’m swooping in on her like a vulture."
29731,Raj,why larry? did larry call dibs? 
29733,Raj,none of your business. take it or leave it.
29737,Raj,"yes, i’m very hopeful. hello missy.  they mentioned there may be side effects. "
31786,Raj,"you know, you and i have so much fun hanging out. if you were a girl, all our problems would be solved."
29744,Raj,we indians invented them. you’re welcome.
31792,Raj,you really think so?
31793,Raj,"thank you. uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?"
31795,Raj,"so then i went to cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like hogwarts. that’s where i fell in love with astronomy, and now i’m an astrophysicist at caltech, so i guess you could say, uh, raj is my name and stars are my game. and rhyming is also my game. so, uh, two games. uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. i want to hear everything about you."
33845,Raj,i would never call howard.
29749,Raj,"excuse me, but i think you’re missing a big opportunity here. "
31802,Raj,"you’re wasting your time. just please, leave me alone."
29755,Raj,dude! everybody left an hour ago! surprise! 
31804,Raj,why would i want her number? i don’t want anything to do with this woman.
33854,Raj,what else are you gonna do with it? put it in your coffee?
33855,Raj,"nothing to worry about. she’s just been crying for a little while, and i was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
31807,Raj,"see you. no, wait, take her number. i don’t want the temptation."
33857,Raj,"oh, okay, false alarm. little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
33858,Raj,"and j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is princess bride."
33859,Raj,"good, good. uh, listen, i just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
33860,Raj,"oh, daddy, you’re so rich and funny."
31810,Raj,"just a sec. oh, who says just a sec? i hate myself. hello."
31812,Raj,oh.
31817,Raj,"that’s great. i’m broken, too."
29771,Raj,"adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the t in often? "
29772,Raj,"well, we all knew this day was coming. "
31820,Raj,"you won’t regret it. i’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. and that, boys and girls, is how it’s done."
33871,Raj,it is. he stopped trying to find indian girls for me to marry. 
29776,Raj,sixty years. used to be a watch factory. 
29777,Raj,what? 
31826,Raj,"i am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people."
29781,Raj,"yes, isn’t she an amazing actress."
31832,Raj,"oh, well, i’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if i hadn’t tried your food first."
29786,Raj,doesn’t count.
33885,Raj,i thought we were best friends?
29789,Raj,"h-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking leonard for not moving on. dude, you have totally not moved on."
31837,Raj,"yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while."
29792,Raj,i think she’s smoking hot.
29793,Raj,technically it would only be rebound if he and penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
31840,Raj,"couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?"
31844,Raj,"i agree. that is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before."
29798,Raj,it’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
33895,Raj,how bad is it?
33899,Raj,it’s intimate waxing. quit looking at that.
29803,Raj,remember that little planetary object i spotted beyond the kuiper belt?
29804,Raj,"or as i called it, planet bollywood. anyway, because of my discovery, people magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch."
29805,Raj,thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
33903,Raj,"okay, you’re right, i got myself into this, but i’ve never missed a comic-con with you guys."
31851,Raj,"good day, mrs. davis. this is dr. rajesh koothrappali from the astrophysics department. don’t be alarmed, i’m not really in space. anyhoo, i’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video."
31855,Raj,"come on, daddy. all the other scientists have seat warmers. this is so humiliating. i’ve got to get tenure. okay, let’s meet halfway. how about i cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? looks like we’re both going to be living like animals."
29810,Raj,the people from people.
33907,Raj,but i need to earn enough money so i can go to comic-con.
31860,Raj,yes.
29815,Raj,"actually, 2008 nq sub 17 is a planetary body."
31863,Raj,"yeah, screw it. i’m going in."
31868,Raj,"yes, mummy was right. american girls are sexually voracious devils."
33917,Raj,"thank you, but it doesn’t look like i’m going to comic-con this year."
29822,Raj,"excuse me. oh, it’s my assistant trevor. go for koothrappali. uh-huh."
31870,Raj,"no, no, i don’t know if i should. if she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. it’s almost like i’m reading her diary."
31872,Raj,"it’s not creepy. don’t listen to him. oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses."
29826,Raj,"speaking of untouchables, i’ve got great news for you guys. people magazine is having a reception this saturday, and i managed to get you invited."
31875,Raj,"i broke down, and i read lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, i struck her as a little feminine."
29830,Raj,sheldon?
29831,Raj,"well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on saturday."
31879,Raj,why do you have to make everything so filthy? why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
29833,Raj,really? cool.
33933,Raj,but you made the garage sound so fun. 
33936,Raj,can i get anyone anything at all?
33938,Raj,"anyway, thanks again."
33939,Raj,"thank you, sheldon. it’s a blank notebook. "
33940,Raj,this means a lot.
29844,Raj,it has more food too.
29846,Raj,"no, wait, the evening’s not over."
29847,Raj,"no, it’s time to put on some r. kelly and suck face."
31896,Raj,no. bought this at the staples center when i went to see taylor swift.
33945,Raj,that’ll do it.
31897,Raj,"hey, i just found out i have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. any chance you and bernadette could take care of my dog?"
29851,Raj,"now you listen to me, i am no longer a child, and i will not be spoken to like one. now if you’d excuse me, i have to go throw up."
33949,Raj,"well, i texted you, but you didn’t respond. leonard and penny were arguing."
31902,Raj,"it’s very simple. for breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an english muffin, but not both. we’re watching our weight. uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like."
29857,Raj,good morning. is there some new kind of casual friday i don’t know about?
31906,Raj,"a lane frequented by liars. like you, you big liar."
29859,Raj,"i love this time of the year. the leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air."
33957,Raj,don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
29864,Raj,hold on a second. kreplach?
31913,Raj,i’m actually glad lucy had to work tonight. saved me the awkward conversation about how i was gonna be hanging with my bros.
33962,Raj,"and just so you know, it’s only temporary. i’m not gonna get too comfortable."
33966,Raj,it’s my fault. i asked penny to do yoga with me.
33968,Raj,"bye, cinnamon. be a good girl."
33969,Raj,"okay, and tree pose."
29875,Raj,what do we do now?
31927,Raj,"no, no. uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance."
33977,Raj,"with your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
29884,Raj,are you joking? star trek v is the standard against which all badness is measured.
33981,Raj,you want to go shopping?
31932,Raj,lucy?
33983,Raj,"yeah. you know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
33985,Raj,"no, no, penny, don’t dismiss his feelings."
29890,Raj,what’s plan b?
29892,Raj,hey.
29893,Raj,"you know, screw it, i’m just gonna eat the dumpling."
29894,Raj,you told me you were going to have the talk with him.
31940,Raj,"i’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
33992,Raj,"are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? actually, never mind, don’t answer. i’d love to."
29896,Raj,for which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light leonard.”
33994,Raj,"wait, you don’t remember?"
29901,Raj,answering the question once and for all why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
33999,Raj,"wait a minute. hey, let me see your phone."
34000,Raj,"well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
29903,Raj,of course not. look at her.
31955,Raj,"oh, lucy, you don’t have to answer that. don’t put her on the spot. she hates that. am i right? tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. go ahead, tell her."
34004,Raj,"wait, hang on. did you go to a cowboy bar?"
29913,Raj,in more ways than one. he’s a very handsome man.
29914,Raj,"oh, yeah, like you have a shot with zac ephron."
34018,Raj,you should send that to jimmy fallon.
34021,Raj,"hey, what’s up?"
34024,Raj,"sheldon, what did amy have that attracted you?"
34025,Raj,really?
29929,Raj,"i’m curious, what part of america is that accent from?"
31978,Raj,so i guess what i’m saying is i get where lucy’s coming from.
31980,Raj,"… but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. i know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. slowly but surely. and oh how i cried. it was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. but i’m a man, okay? so i need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. i mean, it’s not all bad, right? having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."
31981,Raj,"i think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage i saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, lucy, and i didn’t get upset at all."
34030,Raj,like j-lo’s hair.
29935,Raj,"way to bust out the jedi mind tricks, dude."
34033,Raj,hey.
29937,Raj,"go, monte! go monte!"
29942,Raj,"don’t feel bad leonard, negative results are still results."
34040,Raj,"oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
34045,Raj,bert has a room for rent.
34046,Raj,"uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. so the only time i’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
32006,Raj,there was.
29959,Raj,here.
29960,Raj,"plus, no one stole their pants."
29961,Raj,i should’ve peed before we left.
32007,Raj,"i will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only i can give her."
32008,Raj,"no, not a thing."
32012,Raj,"well, we’ve all seen your mom. that butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
34062,Raj,what just happened?
34063,Raj,so what do you guys think that’s about?
34065,Raj,"i keep telling you, close the bathroom door."
32018,Raj,"okay, yup. see, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. but you know, i bet, i bet when i do it, mine do the same thing."
34067,Raj,can you even eat those things?
34069,Raj,"uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into sheldon."
32022,Raj,"yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
29975,Raj,what was all that about?
34072,Raj,may i join you?
21785,Raj,"tushie is buttocks, right?"
32027,Raj,"so, couldn’t help but notice none of you rsvp’d to my murder mystery dinner party."
29986,Raj,"you fail to take into account that even mute, i am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty."
34083,Raj,"ooh, she’s standing very close to me. oh my, she does smell good. what is that, vanilla?"
21794,Raj,cool.
32034,Raj,any questions?
29996,Raj,yes?
32044,Raj,"don’t you see? when we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. oh, look. see? even i’m a winner."
34095,Raj,i’m coming up so you better get this party started.
32047,Raj,i just wanted to do something beautiful.
30001,Raj,go. 
34099,Raj,"all right, what’s next?"
30004,Raj,we only had four servants. and two of them were children.
34101,Raj,hello there
30005,Raj,we have 128 assorted penny blossoms ready to ship.
34103,Raj,hello.
34104,Raj,“i’m so lonely and horny i may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
34105,Raj,"but mummy, all the other guys are going to the north pole."
34107,Raj,"sheldon, are you busy?"
30013,Raj,"well, what are we waiting for? let’s bounce, bitches."
30014,Raj,here we go. lock up your daughters! we’re going to hit it and quit it.
32065,Raj,yes.
34116,Raj,"oh, too bad! sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! hey, look, sheldon! birdie, birdie, birdie!"
34117,Raj,rum cake?
34118,Raj,"was that the best 99 cents i ever spent, or what?"
30022,Raj,"come on, you know i can’t talk to women unless i’m lit up like the hindu festival of diwali."
30030,Raj,aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
34128,Raj,"hey, i’ve got winners."
34132,Raj,"hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
34133,Raj,"good morning, sheldon."
30036,Raj,"look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. i love las vegas."
34135,Raj,"hello mummy, daddy, how are you?"
32088,Raj,fine. i will melt her heart. and her face.
32089,Raj,"yeah, i read your paper online. that technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
34138,Raj,"good lord, what have i done?"
34142,Raj,"oh, just because i’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? maybe something good happened."
32095,Raj,"look, i’m a lonely guy, i watch a lot of movies. look, penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
34144,Raj,"my dad’s a gynaecologist in india, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix."
34145,Raj,that’s a fitting pun-ishment. i still don’t know what you do for a living.
34146,Raj,anything i might have seen?
30049,Raj,"oh, i miss her already."
30052,Raj,"it’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. she’s exactly his type. a hooker. you know, i bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up."
30051,Raj,usa today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
32101,Raj,"wait, i don’t understand. they didn’t find the element?"
34151,Raj,"oh, no."
32102,Raj,"oh, that’s a big deal."
30057,Raj,prostitute.
32105,Raj,yeah.
30059,Raj,a little baby.
32107,Raj,excuse me. i happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
30061,Raj,you’re paying? have you been selling your sperm again?
34159,Raj,"thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one runs from loki, the other runs from stones. so, what do you think?"
30063,Raj,"he’s right. this is an important achievement, for two reasons. number one, and, of course, number two."
34162,Raj,what is wrong with me? why am i so self-destructive?
34164,Raj,"i mean, this is the first time i’ve ever broken up with someone. i just, i didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much."
30068,Raj,don’t you mean the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste distribution system?
32117,Raj,"no, thanks."
30074,Raj,"okay, look. instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?"
30076,Raj,"if you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte."
30081,Raj,what do you think the problem is?
34179,Raj,"okay, emily. yeah, sounds great. see you then."
30084,Raj,"ooh, i don’t like where this is going."
34183,Raj,can i get my stuff? sounds like it’s gonna be a while.
30087,Raj,you still might get on a magazine.
32135,Raj,why is the key always confidence? how come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
30091,Raj,i think i swallowed some paint!
32140,Raj,"good, good. ‘cause no matter how hard i try, i cannot get the twins to look alike."
34189,Raj,it doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
32141,Raj,"hello. oh, it’s so good to see you."
32144,Raj,"i’m so happy you asked me here, and i hope we can hang out again sometime. you know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
32150,Raj,"oh, it’s okay. i have no morals and i’m desperately lonely. i’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
32154,Raj,"ah, no problem. it wouldn’t be thanksgiving without an indian providing the food. uh, now, where does your mom keep the crisco?"
30110,Raj,i feel bad for the guy.
30112,Raj,"boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
30116,Raj,to what? toy story?
32167,Raj,don’t be silly. sit. you look like you’ve had a long day.
32168,Raj,"please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. now, tell us all about your day."
32171,Raj,there’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. and it’s when you’re ten.
32172,Raj,"good morning, everybody. i picked up coffee while i was out. bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha."
30125,Raj,"yeah, you…"
32173,Raj,"oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. you’re gonna be great."
32177,Raj,that’s why i got you hot chocolate.
30132,Raj,i wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
32183,Raj,"look, i’m sorry you’re upset with me, but i just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
30151,Raj,"light beers? well, wiki-how about that?"
32201,Raj,ew.
32202,Raj,"at least leonard, howard and i would have always been friends."
32204,Raj,"yeah, i was wrong. but i do think you and i would have had a great time."
30158,Raj,"well, i am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. when there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
30161,Raj,"yeah, i’ve been there as well. i like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
32210,Raj,"ooh, mark harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
30163,Raj,dark and fun.
32219,Raj,"that depends. on any level, do you think she’s hot?"
30172,Raj,"when we tell this story, let’s end it differently."
32223,Raj,sorry.
32224,Raj,"uh, excuse me. "
30183,Raj,i wonder how they smell.
32234,Raj,"well, do you support this?"
30187,Raj,"you know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. hey, did you know netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
32238,Raj,"oh, who was that girl from our starbucks?"
30191,Raj,hello sheldon.
32240,Raj,"i guess, uh, i’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, i was wrong. i love you. and then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
30195,Raj,we believe cows are gods.
30196,Raj,"do not tell me about my own culture, sheldon! in the mood i’m in, i’ll take you out, i swear to cow!"
30197,Raj,"me, too. i’m just, i’m a little on edge."
32244,Raj,we’re sorry amy didn’t want to go.
32246,Raj,"oh, i have to go to the bathroom so bad."
30205,Raj,"well, i ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
30208,Raj,"that’s okay. a complaint has been filed. so, that’s it. that was my last hope. i’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin sanjay. or, as you may know him, dave from at&t customer service."
32258,Raj,i don’t know. maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
32260,Raj,do it.
30214,Raj,shall i wait?
32263,Raj,"okay, i’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
30216,Raj,"yes, for you. i do, however, have a few conditions. first, at all times, i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. and third, you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture."
30217,Raj,thank you.
30218,Raj,then you leave me no choice. i accept the job.
32264,Raj,what about that little cup they give you?
32267,Raj,it is. i feel alive.
30221,Raj,"come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years."
32268,Raj,maybe slapped with a fine.
32270,Raj,"he’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
30226,Raj,sheldon.
30228,Raj,thank you.
30229,Raj,yes.
32276,Raj,"oh, my god, cinnamon, are you okay? i can’t believe you two. you do whatever it takes to save her life. if she needs new organs, i’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
32280,Raj,"oh, is cinnamon gonna be okay?"
30234,Raj,"my god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. well, let me tell you something. some of those thoughts are pure caca."
30240,Raj,"i’m not defacing it, i’m fixing it."
32289,Raj,"ha-ha, very funny. make fun of the foreign guy. for your information, there are four times as many indians as there are americans, so the way we say it is right."
30243,Raj,you are not my superior.
30244,Raj,"oh, yeah? can you do this? "
32293,Raj,magic wand tv remote?
32295,Raj,"oh, uh, let me try. uh, channelis changeroni. this might be my second favorite brown magic wand."
30249,Raj,for you or with you?
30250,Raj,"all right, but i have some conditions."
30251,Raj,i’ll take the job. see you monday.
32297,Raj,what’s going on? oh. wait. on. and off. what’s going on?
32304,Raj,not at all. he’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. it’s like me in those moments when i miss india.
30258,Raj,damn.
32312,Raj,"and how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. and you threw up again. and so on and so on."
30269,Raj,"ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. sign here."
32317,Raj,you’re only making it seem more real for me.
32322,Raj,ha-a-a. still funny.
30275,Raj,"you know you keep quoting wrath of khan, but he was in next generation. it’s a totally different set of characters."
32325,Raj,"i don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so i’ll put up with it."
32327,Raj,it has been a while since i got my prostate checked.
30282,Raj,sure you can. do it! do it!
30284,Raj,kites ho!
32332,Raj,"well, i was up all night trying to write to her, but i wanted to run it by you first."
30286,Raj,"oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. on the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. one, two…"
30291,Raj,son of a bitch.
32341,Raj,do that. see?
32342,Raj,maybe i can go with you guys to houston?
32345,Raj,"hey, you busy?"
30298,Raj,"i’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."
32347,Raj,great. and?
32349,Raj,"i’m not too shy and passive. you write her back and tell her i said that. you know, when you have a second."
32352,Raj,"i find a girl i like, and you’re stealing her?"
32355,Raj,"amy told me you were concerned that i might be too passive and shy. let me ask you something. would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?"
32358,Raj,"he’s in texas, he’ll never know."
32360,Raj,"hey, stuart!"
30313,Raj,i… i do enjoy the la brea tar pits.
30317,Raj,fine. go ahead.
32365,Raj,he’s been murdered by someone in this room.
30319,Raj,don’t put yourself down. you’re a very attractive man.
32368,Raj,"lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?"
30326,Raj,"well, excuse me, i don’t think penny’s out of line at all. you don’t own her. it’s like my girl, beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”"
30331,Raj,"oh, my god, you are such a mama’s boy."
32380,Raj,from the future? how fun and imaginative.
32382,Raj,"does the smart-ass know that terminator was actually ripped off from an outer limits script called demon with a glass hand, by harlan ellison?"
32383,Raj,"okay, murder suspects, leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. you’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. and welcome to 20 years in the future. hey, you guys just time-travelled. stop looking so bored."
30338,Raj,"okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. that means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
30340,Raj,big deal. every time i watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
30341,Raj,"not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
30344,Raj,wow. wonderful. how old are they?
32395,Raj,"i, i don’t know if you remember me."
32400,Raj,"yeah, we have plans this weekend. and if it’s a clear night, i’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."
30358,Raj,"one day, i hold a great ball for the president of france, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. i am embarrassed, so i eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
30360,Raj,"i know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
30361,Raj,"oh, i’m so hungry!"
30363,Raj,"me, too. but what? "
30364,Raj,"…and the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin."
30365,Raj,who cares? you slept with your cousin.
32411,Raj,"oh, no."
32418,Raj,"well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
30371,Raj,"you can’t sink. with all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away."
32421,Raj,"yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you."
30375,Raj,what’s this?
30378,Raj,here comes kripke!
30387,Raj,"great. they get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
30397,Raj,"i don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. please, sheldon, i’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and i need to strut my stuff."
30402,Raj,what?
30403,Raj,thanks for coming with me.
32450,Raj,"i do, but for some reason, emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so i thought if i start with you first, then i could act cool about it with her."
32453,Raj,not that one.
30407,Raj,"sheldon, they don’t have ice cream."
32458,Raj,"on the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. why does emily like this stuff? do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?"
32463,Raj,"here we go, house of a 1,000 corpses."
30416,Raj,you know india?
30418,Raj,hello.
30419,Raj,what was that?
30420,Raj,"जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. that’s hindi for whatever floats your boat. uh, listen, i got a text from that girl abby, and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again. what do you say?"
30421,Raj,i don’t get it. you had a great time.
32466,Raj,"then, why do you watch these things?"
32470,Raj,"hey, penny. happy star wars day."
30424,Raj,so does that mean we can go with the girls again?
30426,Raj,"oh, god! yes, we get it. you have a girlfriend now."
32480,Raj,by staying here and watching the movie.
30443,Raj,"dude, i’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?"
30445,Raj,me.
32493,Raj,"emily, hey."
30447,Raj,"fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with penny."
30448,Raj,it’s okay. i don’t mind hearing about your sex life. it’s his that bugs me.
32496,Raj,"what do you mean, not really?"
30452,Raj,"oh. well, then i anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
30454,Raj,not much. nuked a burrito. prayed to the hindu god urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
32502,Raj,"sorry, i left them in my turban."
30459,Raj,"oh, my goodness, look at this room! champagne! roses! oh, and little chocolates! this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever."
32514,Raj,hey.
32516,Raj,"uh, look, you and i haven’t made any commitments to each other."
32518,Raj,"well, i mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours."
30472,Raj,and an aquaman action figure.
30473,Raj,huh? that’ll come off.
30474,Raj,it’s even got the elvish engraving on it.
30475,Raj,one ring to find them.
32529,Raj,"you know what? that may be it. by the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. like, i fell off a few times."
32530,Raj,"when i’m feeling low, i have sex with a girl. but that’s just me."
30493,Raj,you’re useless.
30497,Raj,"wait, my laptop. "
32557,Raj,you enjoy giving people grades.
32558,Raj,"hey, sheldon, i’m sorry."
32568,Raj,"so you never played baseball as a kid, not even little league?"
30522,Raj,"okay, sheldon. i’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. these methods come from the ancient gurus of india and have helped me overcome my own fears."
32574,Raj,we still on for tomorrow night?
30529,Raj,whatever you like.
32577,Raj,"look, i’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship."
30534,Raj,"all right. you’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in sheldon square."
30535,Raj,what now?
30537,Raj,"sheldon says impossible. howard and i say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a batmobile."
30548,Raj,"ah, beer. the magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy indian boy into the life of the party. oh, yeah."
32596,Raj,"excuse me, can i say something? i just love both you guys, and i want you to get along. and when i say love i meant as a friend. and, uh, way too soon, right?"
32598,Raj,"it’s true, you’re both gorgeous. kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. you get why i’ve been alone most of my adult life."
32602,Raj,and snacks.
30555,Raj,"what, suddenly i’m not good enough for you?"
32605,Raj,tricking penny into getting engaged.
30559,Raj,"don’t flatter yourself, dude. i want to go out and meet a woman."
30562,Raj,all right. would you mind if i went to your room and downloaded some asian pornography?
30565,Raj,you really think so?
30570,Raj,"dude, i’m an astrophysicist. if there were solar flares, i’d be all up in it."
30571,Raj,i don’t know. do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah?
30572,Raj,"hey, do you think the elastic woman in the incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
32619,Raj,"he’s right. also, what kind of name is biff? sounds like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough. biff."
32620,Raj,do you know if you look at austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
30576,Raj,i don’t put pepper on salads.
32625,Raj,"hey, it was match point."
30581,Raj,when can i sit with you again?
32630,Raj,huh. bill murray did get it wrong.
32634,Raj,yup.
30587,Raj,"ooh, ooh. did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
32637,Raj,"so, i did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. for starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees."
30592,Raj,what?
30593,Raj,i can’t. i’m too sick. go away.
32645,Raj,huh. all this time i never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
32647,Raj,this is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
30601,Raj,"follow my lead. almost. we’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
30602,Raj,"run. run, run, run. don’t look back."
32649,Raj,we’re going to be fine.
30605,Raj,"wait a second, the good wife is crying. something’s very wrong."
30606,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
32654,Raj,let’s set up the equipment. it’ll help take your mind off of it.
30609,Raj,you know what would be fun? signing sheldon up for online dating.
32657,Raj,getting kind of grim.
30612,Raj,holy crap.
30613,Raj,we finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
32663,Raj,"oh, this heat is brutal."
30617,Raj,do you know what he’s talking about?
32665,Raj,"sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop."
32666,Raj,you don’t have to bite my head off.
30620,Raj,uh-oh. she wants to meet us.
30621,Raj,"yes, but him doesn’t even know about her."
32669,Raj,"sheldon, you know what i think of when i’m scared? voyager."
32671,Raj,"by the time i was born, voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. it had seen jupiter and saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. when i left india for america, i was never more scared in my life. i had no idea what lay ahead. whenever i feel that way, i think about how voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. don’t leave. you can do this."
30624,Raj,"right, okay. what are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
32672,Raj,"you call yourself a friend? i was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. you’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward."
32673,Raj,really?
30632,Raj,whoo-hoo!
32684,Raj,you fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. you will not fool me again.
32685,Raj,maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
30642,Raj,"right now, all i can think about is cookies and hawaiian punch."
30645,Raj,that’s my joke. i told it last night. you can’t just use it.
30646,Raj,"oh, sure."
30649,Raj,spoiler alert! spoiler alert.
32698,Raj,"it was our first date, there was an awkward silence. what was i supposed to say?"
32699,Raj,this is so messed up.
30652,Raj,"that’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?"
30656,Raj,really? i thought they were out west someplace.
32714,Raj,"hey, guys. sorry i am so late. i was on the phone with my mother."
30669,Raj,"don’t try to change me, dude. i am what i am."
30670,Raj,hi.
32717,Raj,"you know, i thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then i found his dentures and realized it’s also gross."
32723,Raj,"wrong, smarty-pants. it’s everything is awesome from the lego movie."
30680,Raj,yes?
32728,Raj,does it work?
32729,Raj,"well, he could have been hit by a bus. you don’t know."
32736,Raj,that would be nice.
30690,Raj,no.
32738,Raj,you guys suck.
30692,Raj,knock yourself out.
30693,Raj,no.
32740,Raj,dad.
30702,Raj,this is not over.
30703,Raj,hey.
32751,Raj,come on.
32756,Raj,i’ll do it.
32759,Raj,someone should really close that loading door.
30717,Raj,okay then.
30718,Raj,"oh, not really, just hang out."
10240,Howard,"okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster."
8198,Howard,it’s not weird. there’s lots of kids there with their moms.
8201,Howard,"nobody wants to do that to you, ma."
8202,Howard,didn’t you read my email?
8207,Howard,cheers. you realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
10255,Howard,"hey, what difference does it make? you’re the one she wants to marry."
10258,Howard,"mm. so, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity."
6166,Howard,and you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
6167,Howard,so she’s available for coitus?
6171,Howard,see-ka-tong-guay-jow.
6174,Howard,"this is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
8222,Howard,so you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
8229,Howard,really?
8230,Howard,"i’d love to see that. how about you, raj?"
10277,Howard,it wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
8232,Howard,what’s with the wand and the beep?
6186,Howard,been there.
8235,Howard,bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
8236,Howard,maybe. when it stops being fun.
8241,Howard,i’ll show you one more time. raj?
8242,Howard,all right. . two of hearts.
6197,Howard,"don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
8245,Howard,whoa! somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
8246,Howard,"all right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
10295,Howard,we could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
6202,Howard,sounds like your neighbour’s home.
8251,Howard,"nah, i think we have to be more subtle."
10300,Howard,"how does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?"
6205,Howard,i’m a romantic.
8254,Howard,"thanks. our culprit is one mr. todd zarnecki, 2711 ocean view road, carlsbad, california."
10302,Howard,i didn’t think they were going to. i just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting leonard’s feelings.
6213,Howard,"that’s true. have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
8262,Howard,"new puzzle, ma. same name. one n, two d’s, three o’s."
10310,Howard,"for the tenth time, that was a groupon."
8265,Howard,beyonce? really?
6218,Howard,"hey, what up, science bitches? may i introduce my special lady friend, summer. "
8267,Howard,why did you bring that?
8268,Howard,"yeah, he walked right into our trap."
10314,Howard,that pan had to soak and you know it.
10317,Howard,"i want that, too."
10318,Howard,"ooh, laser tag, laser tag."
10320,Howard,"wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
6228,Howard,and walks in quiet beauty like the night. 
8277,Howard,"hey, everybody, i got something i want to ask bernadette, and i can’t think of a better time than when i’m with all my friends."
8278,Howard,thank you. bernadette maryann rostenkowski…
10325,Howard,"still lives with his ma. yikes, right?"
8282,Howard,"oh, i love you so much."
10330,Howard,"oh, yeah, she loves that place. every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. that’s why i don’t take her to seaworld."
6236,Howard,"yes, but you don’t have to lose to kyle bernstein’s bar-mitzvah party. "
10332,Howard,they’re not dating. they’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
6242,Howard,"no, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo. "
10341,Howard,you know exactly who it is. he’s gonna bring my mom. why did you even invite him?
10343,Howard,what was i gonna do? they were playing our song. i can’t take this anymore.
6248,Howard,"hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. i believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough. "
10347,Howard,"oh, my god."
10348,Howard,that’s jeanie.
10350,Howard,"she is my second cousin. we were 15, i just said, don’t say it."
6255,Howard,i’m supposed to give him a ride home.
10351,Howard,raj.
10352,Howard,"so, my mother’s okay with this?"
10354,Howard,why would you even come to this? didn’t you know i’d be here?
6262,Howard,"oh, yeah, sorry, i’ll have it cleaned."
8310,Howard,"no, she never mentioned it."
6264,Howard,more precisely we used your loofah. i exfoliated her brains out! 
8312,Howard,"that’s good to hear, ’cause i’ve got some news."
6266,Howard,in here my lady.
10360,Howard,what?
8316,Howard,i was filled with adrenaline. it happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
6270,Howard,"so, what do you say, you wanna repair to castle wolowitz? "
6271,Howard,"i’m sorry, i should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is wolowitz."
6273,Howard,when they perfect human cloning i’m going to order twelve of those.
6274,Howard,"who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept!"
8325,Howard,"well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
6278,Howard,"so, halo night, huh? "
8329,Howard,what’s wrong with the bathroom here?
10378,Howard,not important.
8332,Howard,is she okay?
6288,Howard,give me the phone.
10384,Howard,i love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
6290,Howard,"don’t worry, you’ll thank me.  you may now thank me. "
8343,Howard,colossal serpent.
8345,Howard,uh..
10395,Howard,mmm. it’s just columns of random numbers. toss it.
6301,Howard,"i’ll tell you what just happened, i just learned how to pick up indian chicks. "
8352,Howard,"no, ma! it’s raj!"
10400,Howard,"yeah, i’m not even sure if it’s the right word."
10401,Howard,are we sure this is the place?
6310,Howard,forget the parties? what a nerd. 
8358,Howard,"i don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy."
10407,Howard,"oh, yeah."
10409,Howard,i agree.
8363,Howard,you bought me a rolex? how much did this cost?
6320,Howard,okay. so what’s up? 
8369,Howard,"hey, if i wasn’t engaged to bernadette, that totally could have been me."
8370,Howard,you’re not in love with penny.
8371,Howard,who?
10417,Howard,don’t yell at me. you’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
8373,Howard,i don’t see anything.
8376,Howard,"let it go, sheldon. i’ll get you a jamba juice on the way home."
10427,Howard,you know what i think your problem is? you’re jealous because you and i used to be best friends until koothrappali came along.
6332,Howard,it’s leonard.
8380,Howard,hang on.
8381,Howard,hand me the tuna melt.
8383,Howard,"when you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
10430,Howard,"i said, stay out of it."
6337,Howard,hello.
8385,Howard,"hey, leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
10432,Howard,how do you know it wasn’t leonard?
10436,Howard,"on three. one, two, three."
6343,Howard,take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. 
6344,Howard,sorry.  found ‘em. 
8392,Howard,close. really french it.
8393,Howard,"yeah, you got it, you got it."
10444,Howard,"oh, he blinked his eyes. he’s alive."
8398,Howard,on three?
10448,Howard,we can’t do that.
8401,Howard,neither of them are close.
8402,Howard,which side do you come down on?
6355,Howard,"because you didn’t keep true.  okay, turn right. "
8404,Howard,"first of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. and, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
10449,Howard,it smelled too much like blue jay.
10452,Howard,now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
8409,Howard,don’t listen to her. go to the movie theatre.
6363,Howard,"you know, sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. "
10460,Howard,"i’m happy to. i think getting out of the apartment will do you good. so, where we headed?"
6365,Howard,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
10462,Howard,"oh. okay. it’s not like indiana jones and the temple of doom, right? some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out."
6368,Howard,"when this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. "
8417,Howard,"only when it’s fatty. well, don’t be jealous, babe. someday you’ll get to cut it for me."
10465,Howard,"well, because i’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in god, and last diwali i watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a brazilian steak house."
8425,Howard,"and we have splashdown. wait here, i’m gonna go light a candle. and then we make passionate love."
6378,Howard,what about biology? 
10476,Howard,that’s nice.
8436,Howard,"really? so we’re playing dungeons and dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? isn’t that a little on the nose?"
10484,Howard,hold on. what’s in it for us?
6391,Howard,did anyone see how he did it?
8440,Howard,"uh, i don’t want to show any more of your friends how i can fit in the booster seats."
6393,Howard,i guess times have changed since we were young. smart is the new sexy. 
8443,Howard,he’ll text you.
8444,Howard,maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
10493,Howard,yes.
6398,Howard,maybe they had to go to a clinic. imagine spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
8446,Howard,really? that’s the first thing you want to say?
10497,Howard,you look like you got some rest.
8451,Howard,no.
10506,Howard,yes.
6412,Howard,okay. 
6414,Howard,so who’d he get to be on his team.
10512,Howard,"yeah, well, sometimes you work late."
8466,Howard,here’s some other fun news on the raj/emily front. he gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
8467,Howard,"what the hell? the last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
6420,Howard,hit that thang. 
6421,Howard,"dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. "
8470,Howard,"yeah, this is a bad idea. we should go."
6423,Howard,yes.
8471,Howard,wow.
6425,Howard,"all night long, y’all! "
10518,Howard,"well, i’m her son, and i say it’s not okay."
10519,Howard,"well, maybe i should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. then i could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother."
8476,Howard,try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
10521,Howard,"it’s my mom’s furniture. it belongs in the house i grew up in, next to that pile of tv guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art."
10523,Howard,"i’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy."
10526,Howard,my mom died.
10530,Howard,are you kidding me? you lost my mother’s ashes?
10533,Howard,the world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
6438,Howard,"not necessary, i have a masters in engineering, i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. when the mars rover started pulling to the left i performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  no, that baby’s broken. "
8486,Howard,"oh, i get it. you’re worried about me. that is so sweet. you know, there’s a saying we have at nasa. what makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
6440,Howard,"you can’t just keep it here, what if i meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that? "
8488,Howard,honestly? sex.
6445,Howard,why?
6446,Howard,"screw his balcony, i’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage. "
8499,Howard,"i love you, too. so, sex now?"
8500,Howard,what choice did i have? she went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
10550,Howard,"you know what, you sound busy, i’m gonna let you go."
6455,Howard,well she’s free to examine my briefs.
8503,Howard,obviously.
8508,Howard,"well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause i’m not just gonna stop with the space station. yeah, i want to go to the moon, i want to go to mars. i want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
6461,Howard,"was it perhaps destiny, i think it was destiny. "
6462,Howard,"destiny, thy name is anaheim. "
8509,Howard,"well, those big kids were rocking it."
8512,Howard,"so, this spring, i get to go to the international space station."
10556,Howard,it’s fine. you just need two more nails.
10557,Howard,in emily’s eyes.
10559,Howard,"but we’re not going to, are we?"
10564,Howard,"stuart, we’re here."
8518,Howard,he says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
10566,Howard,"wait, when did it go out?"
10569,Howard,"it’s not just food. this is the last food my mother ever made. this is her last brisket. this is her last meatloaf. this is her last. i have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one."
10570,Howard,no. all ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
8523,Howard,did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
8528,Howard,whatever. 
6481,Howard,"oh, you poor, deluded bastard. "
8529,Howard,"trick or treat, bubbeleh."
6483,Howard,okay. 
10579,Howard,i’m never gonna talk to her again.
10580,Howard,no. i want to do this.
6486,Howard,the amazing howard. do you like magic?
10581,Howard,okay.
6488,Howard,okay. 
6490,Howard,"well i love birthdays, waking up to mom’s special french toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
10587,Howard,i wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of thor.
8540,Howard,"raj did it. and he says he would do it again. okay, i’m sorry. you sent me the picture, i wasn’t thinking."
6493,Howard,did someone say party? 
10588,Howard,"well, i guess, as an engineer, i lean towards execution. i spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real."
10591,Howard,"all right, amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75."
6496,Howard,what difference does it make?
8547,Howard,"oh, that reminds me, i get fresh sheets tonight. yay."
10595,Howard,we’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
6501,Howard,too late.
8550,Howard,"what? please! this is billy the kid we’re talking about. i mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is billy the kid doing in the mystic realm of ka’a?"
6503,Howard,try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention. 
10597,Howard,that’s not fair. it’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
10601,Howard,"that’s right, okay, raj can play for me."
8557,Howard,sorry. creepy tepee.
8559,Howard,"ooh, a sheriff’s badge."
8564,Howard,you wore underwear? you fool.
8566,Howard,like the black death and europe.
10617,Howard,something happened different from the way you wanted it.
10619,Howard,"great, it’s all done. the lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. i didn’t have to meet him, i didn’t have to talk to him, i don’t even know where he is."
6524,Howard,yes.
8573,Howard,don’t be so hard on him. it’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
8574,Howard,how is that not amusing?
10622,Howard,yes.
10623,Howard,"wuh, uh, who’s your father?"
6530,Howard,i don’t think i can. 
8579,Howard,i just gave it to her!
8580,Howard,"she’s not stacked like you, ma! she never steps on hers!"
8581,Howard,you’ll do fine. hand me those rings? see? you nailed it.
8584,Howard,"and now, all the rings are magically linked together. my fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. it made all my money disappear."
8587,Howard,"okay, we’re going to stick this in here  and then i’m going to pour in the milk. i hope this works, because i didn’t bring a change of pants."
10637,Howard,it was actually just a mechanical hand.
6543,Howard,"no, it’s wo de ming zi shi sheldon. "
8592,Howard,"all right, settle down. red light. red light, red light! okay, we’re fine."
10639,Howard,sure.
6546,Howard,"you know, i’m really glad you decided to learn mandarin."
6547,Howard,once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. 
8596,Howard,"yeah, she doesn’t like them. and from what i saw, the feeling was mutual."
10643,Howard,"yeah, absolutely. you need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities."
8598,Howard,maybe me and bernadette aren’t right for each other.
6551,Howard,"apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which i cannot find anywhere. "
6552,Howard,"good idea. sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. "
8600,Howard,"huh, it’ll kill her. on the other hand, if i don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. so, either way, on the mom front, i’m golden."
8601,Howard,you should keep it. you could wear it again sometime.
8602,Howard,"i don’t know, hunting?"
10645,Howard,i am making molecular cocktails. this sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
10647,Howard,first take a picture with me.
8606,Howard,me?
8607,Howard,yeah.
6560,Howard,"oh really, did you make a second date."
8609,Howard,"i would love that. but what is that behind your ear? oh, look, it’s a condom."
6562,Howard,"let’s go to the tape. look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
10650,Howard,i know. that’s why i’m spending tonight with you.
8612,Howard,why?
10655,Howard,right. i couldn’t change if i wanted to.
10659,Howard,hello.
6567,Howard,did you make fun of trains? 
10660,Howard,"well, well, well, did you hear that, sheldon?"
10663,Howard,"building on what sheldon said, i could go for chinese."
8619,Howard,"really? me? that’s, like, the best part."
10667,Howard,it’s not always.
8622,Howard,look at that. there’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
6577,Howard,so don’t look at it.
6579,Howard,what about lee meriwether?
6582,Howard,oh for god’s sake.
8630,Howard,i don’t get to pick it. the other guys have to give it to me.
8631,Howard,are you not listening to me? the other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
8635,Howard,"absolutely. but when ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid."
8636,Howard,you can’t do buzz. buzz is taken.
8637,Howard,"no, that’s not what i’m talking about."
10684,Howard,"okay, now all i have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off."
10687,Howard,"boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces."
6597,Howard,"hmm, let’s do it. "
8646,Howard,"yes, please listen to mr. big shot astronaut. hey, good morning."
8647,Howard,"no problem, dr. massimino."
10695,Howard,calm down.
6602,Howard,like if hulk were dating peppermint patty.
6603,Howard,me too. but probably in a different way.
10699,Howard,thank you.
6609,Howard,"that would be me. come to poppa, you un-kosher delight.  i’m not necessarily talking to the food."
10711,Howard,"no idea, but i did it."
6619,Howard,try less teeth. 
8669,Howard,i’ve got some rare comic books. the vespa’s almost paid off. and ma and i have a primo double cemetery plot at mt. sinai right near the guy who played mr. roper on three’s company.
10719,Howard,"for your information, i twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck."
6624,Howard,i have a master’s degree.
6627,Howard,"gee, i’d love to raj, but i can’t make it."
10726,Howard,right. you’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. can you believe this guy?
6631,Howard,"well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning english."
8681,Howard,"you know, this isn’t that pressing. why don’t i talk to him about it in may."
8683,Howard,"i guess. still, it’s a shame professor rothman was forced to step down."
8685,Howard,so sad.
8687,Howard,"sheldon, stop. he’s screwing with you."
6641,Howard,and he should know a lot of women.
8689,Howard,sheldon was higher.
6643,Howard,"oh damn, i picked the wrong side."
6644,Howard,and it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
8692,Howard,the growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? yep.
6646,Howard,"ooh, i want to go to the comic book store. "
8693,Howard,"lookie here, i got my travel orders."
8696,Howard,"you know what does have an oh in front of it? oh, my god, i’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy."
6649,Howard,"sheldon, why are you arguing with the dmv?"
6650,Howard,"okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up."
10738,Howard,never should have told you my middle name.
10739,Howard,"hey, you got a minute?"
10741,Howard,his middle name is david. go.
8702,Howard,"no. yeah, i would have laughed, too, but i didn’t want the vomit to come back out. anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
8703,Howard,"i got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and i have a hunch i packed a little light."
10749,Howard,everything’s gonna be okay.
10753,Howard,leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
6658,Howard,oh god!
6659,Howard,really? why?
6660,Howard,"plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. that’s right, honey, have another calzone, daddy can wait."
8709,Howard,"no, i don’t think it’s possible. i’m severely dehydrated. my pee is like toothpaste."
6662,Howard,woof.
8710,Howard,"thanks, honey, but i can’t quit. if i do, i’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
10758,Howard,"and you have every right to be mad about those things. so, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? i mean, don’t even look at it."
8713,Howard,"oh, i love you so much."
8714,Howard,"don’t worry, once she falls asleep, i’ll spoon you like an armadillo."
8716,Howard,turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
10764,Howard,why are marine biologists always so cute?
8719,Howard,"yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
10767,Howard,i’d like to spongebob her squarepants.
8728,Howard,i’ll miss you more.
6683,Howard,house? what house?
6684,Howard,"a house, where?"
6685,Howard,"wait a minute, you’re telling me that i’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?"
10779,Howard,i don’t know. have you watched the olympics with me?
6687,Howard,"sadly, mrs. giselle wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed."
10784,Howard,"wow, this one’s really stuck."
6689,Howard,giselle’s hanging by a thread.
8742,Howard,then why did she even go out with you?
8744,Howard,"well, yes. but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, bernadette’s or my mom’s."
6698,Howard,"well, my fellow americans, before this year is out we will put a wolowitz on one of america’s top models."
8748,Howard,i told everybody.
8749,Howard,"well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
10797,Howard,how could archie defeat predator?
10799,Howard,why?
10802,Howard,"you know, i’ve actually had one i’ve been sitting on for years."
8756,Howard,"sheldon, i have a working understanding of physics."
6710,Howard,that’s what i meant.
10813,Howard,"where’s this coming from? a few hours ago, we both loved this song."
6718,Howard,"oh, thank god, you’re here."
10815,Howard,"you are such a wimp. she didn’t like it, now you don’t like it."
8769,Howard,it was great. we talked about movies.
6727,Howard,i’ll call ya.
10823,Howard,"oh, one sec."
10825,Howard,"yeah, i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i die young."
8781,Howard,"sheldon, come on back."
6734,Howard,"no, you’re mistaken."
6735,Howard,i don’t know what you’re talking about.
6736,Howard,"well, that does sound like me, but no."
6737,Howard,okay.
6738,Howard,it’s leonard!
6739,Howard,"no one cares, ma! so, what’s up?"
8785,Howard,you should be so lucky.
10836,Howard,my name is darth vader. i am your father. prepare to die.
10837,Howard,"sheldon, instead of focusing on amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl."
6743,Howard,"oh, if it isn’t mrs. dead to me."
10842,Howard,maybe he’s not for you.
6750,Howard,i’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
6751,Howard,"oh, i don’t think you can."
10848,Howard,unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
10851,Howard,not really. visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
10852,Howard,"howard? uh-oh. make room, visigoths. ‘sup?"
6758,Howard,"oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
10855,Howard,may i say something?
6760,Howard,new pants?
10859,Howard,that is reasonable. but what room?
6767,Howard,hey. nice sweater.
10863,Howard,yes. so back me up. the house is good the way it is.
6770,Howard,good for you.
6771,Howard,what if he gets something kryptonian on it?
10871,Howard,"oh. okay, so we must be under the dining room."
6776,Howard,"leonard. now, raj. now, sheldon."
8825,Howard,"okay, just to set the record straight, i didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. shame on you, raj. that is not how we treat women in this country."
10873,Howard,"that’s not true at all. i wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. i’m climbing on top of her every chance i get. in a loving and respectful manner. the point is, i really do want kids."
8830,Howard,i don’t know what my next move is.
10881,Howard,"and this an actual i’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar i’ll think about it”?"
10884,Howard,no problem.
10885,Howard,you sure you’re up for that? she did hurt you.
10886,Howard,hubba bubba over dubble bubble? you’re crazy.
10888,Howard,isn’t that a little unreasonable?
8842,Howard,"yes, yes, i’ve been doing my push-ups. i’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
10891,Howard,you seriously think women would fight for you?
6798,Howard,"featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
6803,Howard,"well, that may be a slight exaggeration. you’d be the only doable girl."
6804,Howard,how is doable anything but a compliment?
8851,Howard,"no, come on. how cool would that be? me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
10904,Howard,maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
6810,Howard,"i’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
10912,Howard,"six hours? oh, god, i don’t want to complain for that long."
6820,Howard,i’m fine.
6822,Howard,"fine, you’re sorry. good-bye."
6824,Howard,"and then, when i was 14, i met marcy grossman. she was so beautiful. she just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. it was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. i didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but i dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show."
6826,Howard,"i guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, marcy grossman, marcy grossman, marcy grossman, talkin’ ’bout marcy…"
10923,Howard,"no fair, i was meditating."
10924,Howard,thanks. you got to be kidding me.
8884,Howard,"good! good! oh, quick question, i missed it in the briefing. how much urine do these suits hold?"
8886,Howard,"no, it’s ’cause i live with my mom and she makes me froot loops."
8887,Howard,"thanks, we decided to do it before the launch."
8888,Howard,"not exactly. listen, if you don’t mind, i’m not really up for chatting. i’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. that went really quick. let me try it again."
10934,Howard,really? why?
8892,Howard,"take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything."
6845,Howard,"hear him out. if he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at comic-con, make a fortune."
10940,Howard,why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
8896,Howard,but i’m leaving in two days.
8897,Howard,i don’t need to take cereal.
10946,Howard,cool name.
8900,Howard,"i mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us."
8901,Howard,you proposed to penny?
8902,Howard,did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
10951,Howard,and at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
10953,Howard,"after that, all i did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until i found his twitter handle."
8906,Howard,thanks.
8909,Howard,"oh, wait to go, raj."
8911,Howard,that’s great.
10959,Howard,"come on, trent, you’re better than th-ah."
8916,Howard,"hey, guys, before i forget, i got you a little groomsman present."
10964,Howard,what are we gonna do?!
8918,Howard,what?
8919,Howard,"yeah, so?"
8920,Howard,it’s the groom.
10965,Howard,got ’em.
8923,Howard,"okay, i’ll see you later, ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. i really got to watch that."
8924,Howard,"ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
8926,Howard,bernadette maryann rostenkowski.
6881,Howard,"wow, you must be very proud."
6882,Howard,"you know the rules. you brought your mom to work, you must suffer."
6885,Howard,"it’s just temporary, i pay rent."
10981,Howard,fear of failure.
6887,Howard,"just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship."
8935,Howard,"hey, there’s my beautiful bride. can you see me?"
6890,Howard,we’ll talk about this later.
8940,Howard,pretty clear.
6894,Howard,"i told you my mom has spider veins, i had to take her to the laser clinic."
10992,Howard,yeah. a grown man moving into his own apartment. crazy times. see ya.
10993,Howard,he’s gone. let’s start in the garage.
10994,Howard,"no kidding. oh, okay, i’m about to suck something up. what do you think this object sounds like?"
6899,Howard,"ah, they left me here to die. what about yours?"
10997,Howard,"well, what do you think we should do?"
8953,Howard,who can tell? she yells everything. she might have been upset. she might have been hungry.
11001,Howard,too busy to call? he wasn’t too busy to binge-watch hot in cleveland with my hulu password. what is happening? are we missing him?
6907,Howard,"that’s great, leslie. thanks."
8955,Howard,"to infinity and beyond, baby."
6909,Howard,"okay, i didn’t want to say anything ’cause i know you and leslie have a little history."
8957,Howard,"oh, i’m never going back."
8958,Howard,"you don’t have to shout, raj. it’s not like i’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. oh, wait, i am."
11003,Howard,that was pretty cute.
11004,Howard,i can’t believe i miss stuart.
8962,Howard,"yes, i read you, sheldon."
11006,Howard,glad to hear it.
8964,Howard,"all right, all right. i gotta go. there’s a meteor shower."
6917,Howard,"that wasn’t quite the word i was looking for, but sure, i’ll do this pass-fail."
8966,Howard,"hey, bernie."
11010,Howard,we should all take a trip or something.
11014,Howard,wow. i’m impressed.
11015,Howard,apology accepted.
6922,Howard,"don’t come in, ma!"
8970,Howard,"well, like for instance, the other day when i was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. when i woke up, i screamed for like nine minutes."
11023,Howard,you should’ve seen us after the good dinosaur.
11024,Howard,you should. he’s really looked.
6929,Howard,"nevertheless, i must depart. by the way, did i tell you? leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to geneva to check out the cern supercollider."
11025,Howard,hi.
11029,Howard,"so, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
8982,Howard,"oh, baby, you’re killing me."
6935,Howard,thanks.
11030,Howard,really? you don’t think she’s attractive?
11032,Howard,really? so it’s okay if i fl…
6939,Howard,"okay, i’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable."
8988,Howard,"oh, a lot better, thanks. one sec. listen close, i don’t have a lot of time. i need you to go to my house. in my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. i want you to take it and bring it back to your place."
8991,Howard,"better. much better. the other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. oooh. attention, people of earth. tonight, there will be two moons in the sky."
11039,Howard,"and made up my mind, i’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke."
6945,Howard,"okay, see you."
11053,Howard,"well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?"
9006,Howard,bernadette? bernie? bernie?
11059,Howard,"nice. a classic rabbit name. peter rabbit, roger rabbit. valentino wolowitz rabbit. oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. of course you’re a wolowitz. son of a bitch, he bit me."
6965,Howard,"placebo, you say. interesting."
6966,Howard,raj.
9014,Howard,what are you doing here?
9015,Howard,you’re a dentist.
6973,Howard,"okay, here’s another one. if you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter, you’d be summer winter."
11072,Howard,are you sure?
9025,Howard,so i’d be sitting by myself?
6978,Howard,"okay. great. now, can i take one where it looks like we’re making out?"
11073,Howard,"oh, my god. this is incredible. we’re gonna be parents? we’re gonna get to board planes first. finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall."
6981,Howard,"too bad. you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess. uh, leonard died again, sheldon. you’re up."
6982,Howard,"hey, you know what’d be a great idea? we get some girls over here and play laser obstacle strip chess."
9031,Howard,"yes. yes, i am."
9032,Howard,"oh, thank you so much. i’ve been having the worst night. i just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, i went to my mom…"
9033,Howard,"yes, please.  perfect."
11081,Howard,"and then there’s this nose. i mean, what if he looks like me? or worse, what if she looks like me?"
9038,Howard,"anywhere but the space station. on a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. but, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view."
6991,Howard,please. dateline could use it to attract predators.
6992,Howard,we add bluetooth!
11088,Howard,that’s easy for you to say. you and sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
9042,Howard,"that reminds me, i was thinking about wearing my nasa jumpsuit as a costume. but then i realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"
9045,Howard,"so, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. what to do? what to do to you? astronaut wolowitz, reporting for booty. preparing thrusters. we have liftoff. are we clear to jettison that nightgown?"
11093,Howard,"well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?"
11095,Howard,you think so?
9048,Howard,what was i supposed to talk about? we were eating at johnny rockets.
7002,Howard,"all right, penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today."
7003,Howard,"so, there is a number."
7004,Howard,"i’ll take the apartment upstairs. i can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift."
9052,Howard,i don’t care. get the tardis.
11102,Howard,i’m really glad you’re here. can we talk?
7007,Howard,"i won’t lie, it’s pretty dope."
11105,Howard,i love you. mmm. and i’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
7010,Howard,i’ll run lines with you in the car.
11107,Howard,"thank you, pasadena. good night."
9061,Howard,i’m sorry. i just don’t want to go.
7014,Howard,may i say you look very comely tonight?
9062,Howard,fine. two weeks ago i was an astronaut.
11109,Howard,that’s funny. let’s do that.
11113,Howard,"sheldon, i don’t think everyone…"
9068,Howard,you’re my wife. you’re supposed to be on my side.
7021,Howard,"yeah, that one. you can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in los angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what i call the wolowitz coefficient."
9070,Howard,just plain old howard wolowitz again.
11123,Howard,seventy-five percent?
11125,Howard,"come on, let’s go."
7030,Howard,you let go.
7031,Howard,it’s my comic book!
11127,Howard,"either way, i get nothing."
7033,Howard,who’s up for sheldon-free saturday?
9082,Howard,"there’s the problem. you can’t beat hawking like that. he hates to lose. everyone knows the guy’s a big baby. i mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller."
9084,Howard,terrible.
7037,Howard,really?
7038,Howard,okay! let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
11132,Howard,"yeah, one sec. i just need to sign this contract."
11139,Howard,what’s to think about? we have an invention and want to move forward.
9092,Howard,"yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks."
11140,Howard,"all right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then i don’t know if i want to talk to you. okay. i get it. and it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but i can take care of myself."
9096,Howard,that’s not true.
7049,Howard,"you got it, sir."
9097,Howard,there’s some underwear in the hamper.
9099,Howard,the lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
11145,Howard,"sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. it’s, it’s with how you treat me."
11154,Howard,"there’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
9108,Howard,that was just for her benefit. i’ll move tomorrow. i love you. don’t leave me.
11160,Howard,"well, hang on. what movie is it?"
11162,Howard,"penny just said they’re having fun. honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?"
7067,Howard,"of course i had feelings for her, i saw her naked for god’s sake!"
11163,Howard,it’s not a problem.
7069,Howard,"it could be fun. i know my weekend’s wide open, now that…"
9117,Howard,"i know. it’s just ever since my dad left, i’ve felt responsible for her."
9118,Howard,"she was just so sad all the time. i was the only person who could cheer her up. well, me and ben and jerry."
11164,Howard,and now you’ve made it a problem.
9121,Howard,"no, but i want to live here."
11170,Howard,hi.
7075,Howard,"you guys go ahead, i just have to finish up an email."
9124,Howard,do you expect me to build this?
11171,Howard,"we went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
9126,Howard,"i’m looking at his public calendar. two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. he never has anything booked during that time."
9128,Howard,colonel koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
7083,Howard,yeah. excuse me for a moment.
7086,Howard,you already gave her the money?
11183,Howard,"okay, that is the least jewish thing i’ve ever seen in my life. you feel like raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?"
11186,Howard,so he can be part of the experience?
7093,Howard,just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
9143,Howard,i think we’re more like ninjas.
11196,Howard,"oh. okay. yeah, i get it. i’ll back off."
9153,Howard,"don’t worry, i’m one step ahead of him."
7106,Howard,"no good. i mean, it might work for the japanese and the americans, but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there? this thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
9155,Howard,i don’t know. the solution to an equation?
9157,Howard,it’s paprika.
7110,Howard,"hang on, i think i’ve got this. help me see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod."
11207,Howard,"all right, here we go."
11209,Howard,"hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?"
9163,Howard,we should stop. i’m exhausted.
9165,Howard,sounds good.
11216,Howard,you’re exhausted? try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
11217,Howard,i guess i am lucky.
9170,Howard,what the hell is that thing?
9171,Howard,wormhole generator test? 
9175,Howard,"hey, fellas, what’s going on?"
9176,Howard,"oh, they’re not the same thing."
7129,Howard,"we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him, are we?"
9177,Howard,thanks. guess who picked up his new car this morning?
9180,Howard,"sheldon, someday, if you get a car, i’m sure they’ll give you another parking space."
11231,Howard,and i’m gonna eat it all.
7136,Howard,"oh, boy, am i gonna get sued."
7137,Howard,you heard the man. hold him down and i’ll cut him open.
11234,Howard,interesting. maybe my male cycle synced up with raj’s actual period.
9187,Howard,fine. i’m taking your diploma.
11238,Howard,"no, she doesn’t."
7144,Howard,"yeah, wow."
9193,Howard,what the hell are you doing?
11240,Howard,"well, she did. and human resources."
9195,Howard,you can’t stay there forever.
11244,Howard,hey.
7153,Howard,and we agreed to never speak of it again.
9205,Howard,"all right. sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, i had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…"
9209,Howard,"you’re the bigger man, sheldon."
7162,Howard,"personally, i don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
9214,Howard,it’s torture. especially with her dad. we have nothing in common.
7167,Howard,this neighbourhood is more texas chainsaw massacre.
9216,Howard,"great, thank you."
11263,Howard,"yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
7172,Howard,sorry. i’ll take a diet yoo-hoo if you have it.
9224,Howard,"okay, dig in."
7178,Howard,"you don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended."
9226,Howard,"oh, you like to fish?"
9228,Howard,"you know, i hadn’t thought of that.  help me."
9229,Howard,"no, no. we know each other well enough. he’s been talking my ear off all night."
11275,Howard,"okay, then. geez, how much wine did you drink?"
9232,Howard,great.  thanks for the help.
9234,Howard,do either of you guys know how to fish?
11286,Howard,five.
11287,Howard,"uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know."
9240,Howard,fine. there.
7193,Howard,"i will put up my fantastic four number 48, first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123, the classic flash of two worlds issue."
9242,Howard,"no, i’m fine. keep going."
11289,Howard,"i can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair."
11291,Howard,"look. the system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation."
7198,Howard,let’s open her up.
7199,Howard,"don’t push me, sheldon. i may be small, but i took kung fu when i was 13, and i remember a good deal of it."
9248,Howard,wish i had known that before i posted all those pictures on facebook.
7201,Howard,"that is not toby, this is toby. raj, what do you think?"
11296,Howard,i can’t believe i was so naive. the military is just gonna take over the whole project. and you know what happens if we object? we disappear. like off the map. like every american idol winner since season four.
7204,Howard,"all right. tell you what, let’s go down to the entomology department and let professor"
7206,Howard,"no, you don’t understand. we just want to ask you a question."
9257,Howard,great couple of gals.
9260,Howard,"i follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way."
7213,Howard,"okay, how about you two? look, i’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
11308,Howard,i told you.
11313,Howard,"hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay."
7218,Howard,what?
7219,Howard,"just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
9268,Howard,"that was amazing, sheldon."
7221,Howard,thanks. can we buy you ladies a drink?
7222,Howard,i’m howard.
9271,Howard,great. let’s do it. 
11316,Howard,yeah. i would not have done that for you.
9273,Howard,"wait, what are you doing?"
9274,Howard,"oh, come on, that can’t be true."
11320,Howard,why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? it has to be bad news.
9276,Howard,you look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.
11325,Howard,what’s the point of that story?
9278,Howard,i don’t know.
7231,Howard,did you bring the black condoms?
11328,Howard,"and if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially."
7234,Howard,"uh, yeah!"
7236,Howard,"well, i can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or kermit the frog."
11332,Howard,"you know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
9287,Howard,has it really only been ten miles?
7241,Howard,what comes after the stencil?
7243,Howard,"no, i haven’t, look.  i’m sorry, i’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
11340,Howard,"anyway, like i said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on thursday. do you have any advice for us?"
7245,Howard,"we’re not goth, we’re just guys."
11343,Howard,hello.
7249,Howard,what’s that got to do with the story?
7254,Howard,we say they’re in a very intimate area.
9302,Howard,maybe thor’s hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
9303,Howard,let me see.
9305,Howard,"you’re still out, right?"
7258,Howard,could happen.
11352,Howard,we didn’t. sheldon did.
11357,Howard,i guess this is it. 
7262,Howard,turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. it’s not as good as it sounds.
9310,Howard,i can’t believe i wasted all that money.
11359,Howard,"oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
7265,Howard,"the bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
7266,Howard,"penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
11363,Howard,"well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights."
9316,Howard,"well, the prices have been coming down."
7270,Howard,"come on, what are you waiting for? call him and set up an interview."
11367,Howard,sorry i have to work all weekend.
9323,Howard,stop holding your stomach in. i’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
11372,Howard,why don’t you just go home?
9325,Howard,"oh, good, you’re home. got a little surprise for you."
7278,Howard,tonight’s the night i usually go line dancing with raj at the palomino.
9327,Howard,"i know, right? and, thanks to photographs and a little 3-d modeling, here comes the bride."
7280,Howard,want me to leave?
9329,Howard,didn’t cost a thing. i made them myself.
7284,Howard,"well, usually, on sundays, i go with raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with sheldon, so i thought i’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. it’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour."
11380,Howard,"we, we’re thinking, two years."
9334,Howard,"yes, but we’re married now. that means, when you get sick, i take care of you. and when you make a bunch of money, i get to buy stuff. sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works."
7287,Howard,"sure. ‘sup, homes?"
9335,Howard,yes. and can you please make that out to bernadette? i was taken off the joint account until i learn the value of money.
9337,Howard,"nah, i blew my food allowance on pokemon cards."
11382,Howard,"yes, thank you so much."
7293,Howard,are we going to talk or are we going to play mystic warlords of ka-ah?
11390,Howard,i don’t know. maybe the surprise will make it more fun. like magic tricks. remember how disappointed you were when i explained the never-ending hanky?
11393,Howard,screw it. i’m calling and finding out.
7299,Howard,why not?
9348,Howard,i told her around seven.
11397,Howard,okay. here we go. it’s ringing.
7302,Howard,why not?
7303,Howard,"leonard, a pact is a pact. you have to get penny to fix me up."
9351,Howard,what? you spent the night?
7305,Howard,"leonard, come on."
7306,Howard,a hot friend.
7307,Howard,and tall. i want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
9353,Howard,"okay, raj, listen to me. you need to get out of there."
9355,Howard,"trust me, you’re not jewish. that’s how they get you."
9358,Howard,what were we thinking? we should have just done it the regular way.
11406,Howard,does it sound sexy?
11410,Howard,"it sounded like it. oh, my god. someone’s in the house."
7317,Howard,do you like science-fiction?
11414,Howard,you know i rely on humour in times of stress.
7320,Howard,you like magic?
7321,Howard,okay.
9369,Howard,a micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
11420,Howard,maybe this is why people get fish tanks. who just turned the porch lights on?
11429,Howard,"oh, god, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. we don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
11430,Howard,do we? look at you. willy wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
9384,Howard,"damn it, it’s in the washing machine."
7337,Howard,good guess.
7338,Howard,whoa! did you see that?
11434,Howard,you’re gonna love it.
9389,Howard,"i’m sorry. that’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off."
11437,Howard,"in our new minivan. hey, what’s for lunch?"
11438,Howard,"it’s for the baby, and i didn’t buy it. the dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
11440,Howard,"it’s got a rearview camera, there’s a dvd player, oh, and check this out. it’s like we’re living in the future."
7347,Howard,it’s not a little scooter. it’s the second biggest vespa they make! are you watching football?
7349,Howard,sheldon knows football?
9397,Howard,"not even a little? i mean, we could have a pants party. go put some on."
7351,Howard,"hey, pal."
7353,Howard,"yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. does a patang?"
7354,Howard,"look, i admit i haven’t always been the best friend i could be."
9401,Howard,okay.
11449,Howard,you’re right. it sells itself.
7357,Howard,"getting shot down by the girl at hot dog on a stick. but in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. it was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
7358,Howard,"hey, at least i can talk to women without being drunk."
7359,Howard,"no. you know what? maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. you’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself."
9405,Howard,"oh, i did spend a lot of my shower time with lieutenant uhura."
7361,Howard,come on. let me take you someplace nice.
9406,Howard,"van nuys pole-dancer d.d. melons. all right, i think we’ve really helped women today. let’s fire up the old xbox."
7363,Howard,"my pleasure. maybe after lunch, we can go to marie callender’s and have some pie."
11454,Howard,"oh, right. "
7365,Howard,no. this is our day.
9413,Howard,"so many memories. i mean, how many times in these hallways was i tripped, punched and spit on? oh, look, here’s my old locker. i have a masters in engineering and i still can’t figure out how scott kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  hey."
11456,Howard,"i’m serious, jpl’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us."
11458,Howard,"you heard him, guys, don’t ask."
7369,Howard,really?
11459,Howard,and how single are you right now?
21712,Howard,"she grows any more hair on her face, yes."
21714,Howard,"oh, probably, if i could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on."
11475,Howard,hi. howard wolowitz.
11478,Howard,"sorry, just passing through. i think this fell off your cart."
7386,Howard,"you know what? i hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
9435,Howard,"i couldn’t be less interested. now, come on, i’ll take you home."
11483,Howard,do you?
11484,Howard,that’s amazing.
11485,Howard,you busy? there’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
11488,Howard,i didn’t buy it. i made it.
9441,Howard,"of course i’m curious. i haven’t seen the man since, oh, i was a little kid. and a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? what’s that about?"
11490,Howard,"no, it’s not. check it out, he says fun stuff."
7397,Howard,"look, they gave me homemade cookies."
7398,Howard,"relax, i said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap."
7399,Howard,cookie?
9445,Howard,i do.  great. neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
11499,Howard,yeah
9453,Howard,"no, i don’t want to know. i mean, i do, but… i got to go."
9454,Howard,in here.
7409,Howard,"wait. wait, wait. so you’re saying we’re out of food?"
7410,Howard,me too. check and see if we have any more pudding.
9458,Howard,why?
11510,Howard,it’s like we have a butler. if i had a batsuit i’d be bruce wayne.
9463,Howard,hmm.
7416,Howard,that’s still not funny.
11511,Howard,"it’s pajamas, there’s no cape."
11516,Howard,"hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
7421,Howard,sure.
11524,Howard,no idea. ask him.
9479,Howard,so is tenure.
11528,Howard,"i’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?"
7433,Howard,"okay, well, before you and penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
7435,Howard,did she say something?
7436,Howard,"i do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and i’m not sure she’s my type."
7437,Howard,"look, bernadette is really nice. i just always thought when i finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
7438,Howard,"well, you know, more like megan fox from transformers, or katee sackhoff from battlestar galactica."
9487,Howard,it’s exactly what it’s like. keep reading.
11531,Howard,"deep breaths, slow breaths."
11532,Howard,"uh, stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back."
11537,Howard,hm. she would’ve been the best grandma.
11541,Howard,do you want me to get the nurse?
11542,Howard,"she’s here, the baby’s here."
9496,Howard,so take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
11546,Howard,"i’m gonna get back. thank you for staying up, i can’t wait for halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
7451,Howard,i’m taking a bath!
9501,Howard,"to be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. i’ll talk to bernie. i’m sure it’s fine."
11550,Howard,"no. i got it. doubtfire, poppins, follow me."
7455,Howard,"wait, bernadette, i need to talk to you."
11551,Howard,what did we miss?
7458,Howard,no.
9509,Howard,"yeah, that’s what i was doing."
9510,Howard,really?
7463,Howard,"leonard, penny, you know my girlfriend bernadette."
9512,Howard,"i don’t know, she didn’t leave a note."
11560,Howard,"she doesn’t hate you, stop saying that."
11563,Howard,great. and where are you?
7471,Howard,"have no idea. hey, leonard."
7478,Howard,"wow! you really are a piece of work. it’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
9526,Howard,"the ladies are away, the boys will play."
11575,Howard,did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
9530,Howard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like nicolas cage. he says,  travel with caution. these woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
9532,Howard,"uh, it does. "
7485,Howard,"that’s great, ma!"
9534,Howard,"a satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like al pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  you’re playing d&d. you’re playing d&d. this whole apartment is playing d&d."
11586,Howard,"it’s a tradition of my people.  if i were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
7492,Howard,i’m already on vibrate.
9540,Howard,"the dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano."
7494,Howard,really? he said that?
9541,Howard,"but wait., he’s not dead. he crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack."
7496,Howard,"i didn’t say anything like that. i said leonard has to ask my permission.  come on, i don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. damn, i was this close on the bra."
11594,Howard,"sheldon, i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader. they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test."
9547,Howard,"the love spell takes effect. when sheldon looks at amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. when amy sees sheldon, he looks, well, just like sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. what do you do?"
11596,Howard,"yeah, i was joking."
11598,Howard,the display is synced to your phone. give it a try.
7503,Howard,hi.
9553,Howard,"calm down, bernie. you’re very scary."
7506,Howard,"look, i know i come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is i’m not."
9555,Howard,maybe your lifetime. i went to space.
9559,Howard,it must’ve killed you when i went to space.
11607,Howard,"not a chance. so, you were telling us how raj was terrible in bed."
9561,Howard,"raj, i can’t come to the party. this is all just too much for me. i don’t think we should see each other any more. sorry. lucy."
11608,Howard,"sorry, is that gary with one r or two?"
9563,Howard,"come on, you can talk to girls now. it shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new."
7516,Howard,what do you mean you don’t know what i’m talking about? tell her i have a girlfriend!
11610,Howard,"wait, hang on. i just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. even at the risk of being humiliated. and i, for one, think that’s very brave."
9566,Howard,of course. you’re my friend. i want you to be happy.
9569,Howard,"i heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
7522,Howard,seen it.
9570,Howard,"mrs. davis, nice to see you. "
11620,Howard,i’m not gonna get fat.
11621,Howard,"fine. look, i’ll exercise right now. one, two. these are crunches, by the way."
9574,Howard,"okay, fine. let’s say there was a moment."
9575,Howard,"there wasn’t. but, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
9576,Howard,so nothing.
9579,Howard,"i’m sorry, i’ve been kind of snippy lately. it’s probably this stupid diet i’m on."
7532,Howard,"had a great night last night. i don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
7534,Howard,are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent cylons?
9586,Howard,i don’t know. few weeks. why?
11637,Howard,"okay, but that’s just a theory. it’s not even a complete thought."
11638,Howard,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
9592,Howard,thanks for coming over.
11643,Howard,he’s worried about looking foolish. that’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.
11646,Howard,"hey, i came up with that and hmm. you haven’t pitched anything."
7552,Howard,"hey, look who’s back!"
11650,Howard,it’s a manifold.
11652,Howard,"but if you really want to learn the mechanical side, i can teach you anything you want to know."
7558,Howard,"boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?"
11656,Howard,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
9609,Howard,hallelujah.
7562,Howard,"not this time, i promise."
9613,Howard,and princeton.
9614,Howard,"yes, to be fair, do people who went to princeton get a head start?"
11663,Howard,maybe your dad’s right.
9617,Howard,have you ever played a game with bernadette?
9621,Howard,"yeah. you know, i bet you and i have more in common than we think."
9622,Howard,i don’t know. tell me some things you like.
9623,Howard,"hey, how about some music?"
11670,Howard,that’s understandable.
7577,Howard,i’d take sheldon to switzerland.
7578,Howard,absolutely. and i’d leave him there. 
7579,Howard,"trust me, you can’t. i’ve tried."
11675,Howard,and hate all the crowds at the panels.
11677,Howard,what if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?
11678,Howard,"yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. you could charge people money to punch you."
9634,Howard,just pour me a drink.
11684,Howard,"ha ha ha, never gets old. okay, there is something i want, but it’s not a big deal."
7589,Howard,"sheldon, this is a summons."
7592,Howard,"okay, he’s going to jail."
11689,Howard,yeah.
11694,Howard,i tried.
11695,Howard,there’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
9652,Howard,bernie…
7605,Howard,"oh, my god. an alf doll. when i was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. i used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet melmac, and alf was going to bring him back to me. but he never did. where’s my daddy, puppet? where is he?"
9653,Howard,i’m sharing my pain.
11700,Howard,there’s more than enough in there to cover comic-con.
11702,Howard,i’m gonna go check on dinner.
9658,Howard,are you crazy? you don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. hell clam.
9659,Howard,would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
11706,Howard,"i know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
7613,Howard,"no, i can’t tell you who it is. stop asking."
11707,Howard,"well, we can make some space in the garage. maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
7616,Howard,"no, but it’s close. look at the markings inside. those are production markings. nine rings were made for use in the lord of the rings movies. three were given to members of the cast. the rest were destroyed. except one. one was stolen. gentlemen, this is the one ring."
7617,Howard,"well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…"
7618,Howard,"yes. he figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
7620,Howard,it’s sad how great that sounds.
9668,Howard,"oh, well, come on, where am i supposed to look when i lie to you?"
11716,Howard,great. go live there.
9671,Howard,"i mean, you know, sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if i hadn’t tried to help you."
11717,Howard,"i just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. unless leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
11719,Howard,"hey, look at that. you’ve got a raj, we’ve got a stuart. maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
9676,Howard,"oh, hi."
11726,Howard,"i’m sorry, i spaced. are we still talking about the spoon?"
11730,Howard,this one says that every time i go out. see? i listen to you.
7635,Howard,that’s not gonna better pull out the big gun.
11733,Howard,wait. what? what do i make you do?
11734,Howard,"it said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. it’s not my fault you didn’t listen."
7639,Howard,what are you doing?
7640,Howard,"no, actually, i wouldn’t mind going, too."
9687,Howard,next week is the anniversary of my first date with bernadette.
9688,Howard,"i want to do something special, and i was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
7643,Howard,you quit the game! you had no right to take it.
11739,Howard,the rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.
11740,Howard,"seven? look at the board, it’s four."
7646,Howard,"yeah, the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
11742,Howard,"son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
11744,Howard,"oh, cool."
7652,Howard,"raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? i don’t know, some indian meditation crap."
9700,Howard,i’m getting worried about bernadette. i’m gonna call and check on her.
11748,Howard,"well, i don’t know, you seem a little upset."
9704,Howard,you’re sure you’re okay?
7659,Howard,"leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
7665,Howard,"while making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out mommy?"
7667,Howard,did you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? because you can die that way.
11763,Howard,"no, no, nothing. okay, well, maybe i’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
11765,Howard,"aha, you are upset. i don’t know a lot about women, but i know i upset them."
9718,Howard,"it’s true, you’d rust."
7671,Howard,"i’m sure you’re probably sick of star trek questions, but, whoopi goldberg, you ever hit that?"
7675,Howard,what’s wrong with you? you can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. that’s totally uncool.
11772,Howard,you want to hear my stuart? it’s been a while since i’ve gone on a date. you mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
7677,Howard,what?
11773,Howard,this is supposed to be our family fun day. what’s so important on your phone?
11776,Howard,they’re highly-trained educators with background checks. they’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.
11778,Howard,learning anything?
7684,Howard,or we could go together.
7687,Howard,you said you were going for a walk.
11790,Howard,see? nothing to worry about.
11791,Howard,"yeah, me, too. love you."
7699,Howard,"yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
7700,Howard,"yeah, um, i have a two-part question."
9748,Howard,"hey, what’re you working on?"
9750,Howard,sure.
9756,Howard,"mmm. i’m gonna say not. that’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to thanksgiving at her house."
11804,Howard,"oh, so our love is not real?"
7711,Howard,what do you mean what? it’s halo night.
9762,Howard,i have a better idea.
11813,Howard,no.
11814,Howard,so you told her she was being dumb?
11816,Howard,"yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
7721,Howard,he’s right. the numbers are shaky enough as it is.
7722,Howard,yep. welcome to the penthouse forum.
9770,Howard,what’s with you?
11819,Howard,i went to see your mom.
11821,Howard,"well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, i got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
9774,Howard,sounds like zack’s the victim. you’re sleeping with his wife.
9780,Howard,"i never had a beer with my dad, either."
7735,Howard,you sure? they say they can find a match for anybody.
9783,Howard,they don’t want me.
7739,Howard,what?
7741,Howard,you’re kidding. an actual woman?
9790,Howard,"yeah, but if i told you a week, would you have said yes?"
9791,Howard,then you left me no choice.
9792,Howard,"i know, but they’re tenting his building. he can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs."
9793,Howard,"for a whole week, the nerve of some people."
11837,Howard,they wouldn’t say.
9796,Howard,"no, we were waiting for you."
9797,Howard,yeah. so what do you feel like making?
9800,Howard,i thought of you the whole time.
11849,Howard,i know and i’m sorry.
9802,Howard,"yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park."
7755,Howard,"okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later."
9804,Howard,what are you doing? are you trying to make me look bad?
11852,Howard,so?
7761,Howard,"and finally, my moo shu pork."
9809,Howard,"so, yes."
9811,Howard,"yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like raj. "
7764,Howard,"that, dear lady, is the wolowitz programmable hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the international space station."
7765,Howard,ask me to pass the soy sauce.
9812,Howard,"yeah, yeah. he packed me a lunch this morning. and there was a note inside that said go get ’em."
9814,Howard,i don’t know. i guess i was just feeling like i’m a lousy husband.
9816,Howard,you made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
11858,Howard,"oh, yeah. back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
11860,Howard,"okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
11865,Howard,"great. anybody’s better than, mmm."
11866,Howard,"we should call guinness, that might be a record."
11868,Howard,"baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me."
11872,Howard,"good point, how you gonna cool it?"
7778,Howard,"i’ll eat later. i’m busy! oh, yeah. just like a real hand. hmm."
11875,Howard,"ola, nerd-migos. "
7782,Howard,"please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
9831,Howard,"well, things would be a little different."
7784,Howard,"no, no! i loaded the wrong program. the hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. if you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting."
7785,Howard,what? no saws! one circumcision was enough.
9833,Howard,"you didn’t let me finish. here you go, mother."
7787,Howard,i…
11878,Howard,"ladies, ladies, i’m sure there’s a middle ground."
9837,Howard,and chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
7790,Howard,"yes, but that’s not the point! get me out of here."
11882,Howard,"oh boy, group hug."
7792,Howard,i slipped and fell.
9840,Howard,"if you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, i could set you up with my mom."
11884,Howard,"howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. why are you calling at this ungodly hour? "
11890,Howard,if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon. 
7798,Howard,"no, you see, it’s more complicated than that.  winnie the pooh is out of the honey tree."
7799,Howard,what do we owe you?
7800,Howard,here you go.
9846,Howard,where’s sheldon?
9849,Howard,"please, i’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  yeah? well, i fake my orgasms."
11898,Howard,"no, that’s what she said, sheldon."
11900,Howard,"hey, steph, it’s me again, howard. listen, if you’re free friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. my mom cooks a hell of a brisket. let me know. it’s howard."
9853,Howard,hi.
11901,Howard,"hey, it’s me again. just want to let you know the head count for dinner friday has gone up. my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs. oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-jewish on your mother’s side. okay, call me. it’s howard."
7807,Howard,"oh, look, it’s leonard and r2-d-bag."
7808,Howard,i say we just take him to tatooine and sell him to some jawas.
9858,Howard,there you go. 
9859,Howard,"so, what is she doing today?"
7813,Howard,"what do you do in the potty, wee-wee?"
7818,Howard,"raj, do you have any questions for amy?"
9867,Howard,"no, don’t."
7820,Howard,"think about it, raj. where did the movie rocky take place?"
9871,Howard,"really, really sorry."
9873,Howard,t minus 45 seconds.
7830,Howard,more like yoko and yoko.
9878,Howard,it’s been ten minutes. we’re running out of time.
7832,Howard,we’re all a little worried about sheldon.
11930,Howard,how the hell do i know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
7835,Howard,i thought we discussed the p-word.
9884,Howard,i already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
11931,Howard,"yeah, i miss you, too, sweetie. listen, i got to go, but i’ll see you tonight? okay. bye-bye. yeah, bye-bye. no, you hang up first. hello?"
7839,Howard,"oh, not since we broke up. wow. how am i going to play this? sophisticated and relaxed? friendly, noncommittal? cold and distant? ."
7841,Howard,"i’ve missed you, katee sackhoff."
11937,Howard,"excuse me. that’s my girlfriend, bernadette. i assigned her her own ringtone, bernadette by the four tops. hello, bernadette."
11938,Howard,why can’t you get it?
7844,Howard,"okay, if you insist."
11940,Howard,he says he’ll wear it if you’ll be aquaman.
11942,Howard,nobody cares about your kegel exercises.
7852,Howard,"wait. katee, why are you leaving?"
9901,Howard,"oh, god, i could really use exactly two tablespoons of pepto right now."
9906,Howard,"a world i don’t want to live in. seriously, i no longer want to live in this world."
11959,Howard,"ooh, eight thirty. you and penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
11962,Howard,hi.
11968,Howard,"oh, howie, stop talking about space so much. nobody likes it."
9921,Howard,check it out.
9922,Howard,"yeah, i can control all sorts of stuff."
7876,Howard,"no. why would you? i’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. you know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11."
11975,Howard,"okay, great. bye. our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
9929,Howard,thank you.
9930,Howard,good news. someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
7883,Howard,"not for me, thanks."
11980,Howard,"i’m not a baby. i’m a grown man, and i made the bed. now where’s my star?"
9935,Howard,i think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
9936,Howard,"but it got the way it was through change. the-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. i bought this couch. me. so explain why that change was bad and this change was good."
7891,Howard,"yeah, but we weren’t, i-i mean, you and i never…"
7894,Howard,i didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
9943,Howard,"fine, maybe i was a little scared."
7896,Howard,son of a bitch.
11992,Howard,that’s raj.
11993,Howard,"i thought you were great, but, oh, my god, you were so dominated by your parents."
7901,Howard,yeah. i think i’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
9951,Howard,"hi, ma. how are you?"
9953,Howard,"oh, me, too. i mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest."
9955,Howard,"went to space? i don’t think so. now, pass the soy sauce. hey, not the green one, the red one."
7909,Howard,"i know all your shirts. that’s not one of them. you were pretending to work at the genius bar to pick up women, weren’t you?"
7910,Howard,"so, how’d it go?"
9960,Howard,i didn’t do anything. i was just sitting here.
9961,Howard,the lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. that’s funny.
9964,Howard,"seriously, i was talking to bernadette last night and she made some great points. you and i have known each other a long time, and i didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off."
7917,Howard,"seriously? i was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual i met on j-date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten."
9967,Howard,no.
7920,Howard,this is the worst cobbler i’ve ever eaten. i mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
9970,Howard,will you please sto…
9972,Howard,"oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car."
7926,Howard,i have a girlfriend now.
9978,Howard,what now?
9984,Howard,thank you.
7938,Howard,they’re just doing a background check on me.
9986,Howard,here you go. be creative. what’s the matter? scared of a little turbulence?
7940,Howard,"apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. you guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?"
7943,Howard,and they were okay with that?
9992,Howard,should we stop holding hands now?
7945,Howard,your apology is not accepted.
7946,Howard,"leave me alone, sheldon."
9998,Howard,"okay, give me the flowers and pie."
7952,Howard,all right. apology accepted.
7953,Howard,"i got to tell you, sheldon, i understand why you chose this spot. i mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. i can see the television, but i can still talk to…"
10001,Howard,"what? sheldon, tell me what’s going on."
7959,Howard,who’s there?
10009,Howard,good luck.
7962,Howard,i have a girlfriend and you don’t.
7963,Howard,so. are you sure you don’t want to come with us to raiders?
10014,Howard,i’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
10015,Howard,"yeah, she was dating this guy, and i was kind of a jerk to her about it."
7970,Howard,"where did he go?  we’re looking for sheldon, not marmaduke."
7971,Howard,"come on, short round."
10025,Howard,only without the sex.
10027,Howard,and?
10028,Howard,i hope i get to meet her as soon as possible.
7988,Howard,"well, he was italian. it’s a reasonable assumption."
7991,Howard,well i’d like to propose a toast. to science and friendship.
10039,Howard,"me, too. i just hope he doesn’t blow it."
10040,Howard,"because he’s raj, that’s his thing. beckham can bend it, ralph can wreck it, raj can blow it. look, i don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… oh, crap, i know that girl."
7994,Howard,"okay, i think that’s enough about me."
7996,Howard,we’d come visit you.
8000,Howard,no!
8011,Howard,why?
10061,Howard,"ah, it’s all right. they could’ve filled the bowl a little more. excuse me."
10063,Howard,you’re awful quiet. everything okay?
10064,Howard,"ugh. me, too. what happened?"
8017,Howard,let me ask you a question. what are you most afraid of?
10067,Howard,"get out of here, barry."
10072,Howard,a straight-up gore-fest? you hate this stuff.
8025,Howard,"get it off! get it off! please, raj! ah! ah! ah! please. oh!"
8027,Howard,ding!
10076,Howard,"beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets."
8029,Howard,fine. how do you want to start?
8034,Howard,we’re starting now!
8035,Howard,i’m legally obligated to inform you that i took a karate lesson when i was 11. i’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
10084,Howard,no. don’t be ridiculous. that’s wookiee life day.
10086,Howard,you’re being so quiet. are you upset or are you just rebooting?
8040,Howard,you narcissistic nincompoop!
8041,Howard,ice dragon.
10090,Howard,or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
10091,Howard,that’s what good friends would do.
8044,Howard,so go apologize.
10101,Howard,she’ll use it. all i need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a honeybaked ham.
10107,Howard,"yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. i’m what my people would call a putz."
8060,Howard,check it out. those guys are breaking into that car.
8061,Howard,"ma, ma, calm down. listen to me. i know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. now, put your finger on it. doesn’t matter which finger. good choice. now move it down to your e-mail icon. yeah, the little envelope. what do you mean, what does it look like? it looks like an envelope! fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. good-bye!"
10115,Howard,"hey, i’m a very paternal person. i’d be excellent at taking care of a baby."
8069,Howard,"there’s your answer, free food."
8075,Howard,howard wolowitz. why not world’s greatest engineer?
10128,Howard,a bowl full of m&m’s with a few ambien tossed in.
10130,Howard,why?
8083,Howard,we have.
8086,Howard,"actually, i was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap."
8087,Howard,"we can watch it later on c-span. besides, i was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel."
8089,Howard,what could we do? he’s the travel supervisor.
10138,Howard,hang on. i know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
8091,Howard,hi. ow. hi.
10139,Howard,"i just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
8093,Howard,"hey, bernie?"
10140,Howard,you sure?
8097,Howard,"no. i guess not. what is he, like, six-four, six-five?"
10146,Howard,what are you talking about? no one’s paying attention to you.
8099,Howard,no. it’s just…
10147,Howard,i just want to pop in and make sure ma’s okay.
8104,Howard,i’m… i…
8105,Howard,"no! no, i’m saying exactly the opposite."
8106,Howard,"yeah, let’s go with that."
8107,Howard,"interesting. i think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry."
10155,Howard,"uh, what are you doing here? i thought you moved out."
10158,Howard,"it’s weird, right? a grown man in his thirties living with my mother."
10163,Howard,she did?
8117,Howard,sheldon still moping?
8119,Howard,labradoodle?
10168,Howard,"well, it’s my house, it’s my rules."
8121,Howard,i just got offered a fellowship at the weitzmann institute in israel.
10175,Howard,and you love the sound of your own voice.
8128,Howard,"raj, i don’t have time. now, pay attention. my last wish is that you look after bernadette."
10181,Howard,i would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until i found the lowest energy solution.
8137,Howard,"hey, put your tie back in your pants."
8138,Howard,you’re kidding.
8139,Howard,i’m an engineer. most engineers don’t bother with a phd. but you may be interested to know i designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for nasa.
10185,Howard,no.
8141,Howard,"it was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. the old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond."
8142,Howard,hey. how was dinner?
8145,Howard,wait-wait-wait. are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
8147,Howard,how was she?
10196,Howard,is that gonna be on the test? because i don’t think i can do that again.
8154,Howard,"it’s not just the wig. it’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. it’s a two-person job."
10202,Howard,"that was a hard one. all right. how does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? you don’t know, do you? what’s the matter, smart guy? don’t know poiseuille’s law?"
10206,Howard,"so, how does this game work? i just throw it, like a real ball?"
8159,Howard,i’ve got a better solution.
10207,Howard,all right.
10210,Howard,"well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me."
10211,Howard,"all right, here we go."
8164,Howard,"i’m not having this conversation with you, ma!"
10214,Howard,"for your information, i also gave leonard one hell of a high five."
8167,Howard,i’m still leaving! i just forgot my claritin.
10215,Howard,they’re doing space day and nasa asked me. i felt like i couldn’t say no.
8171,Howard,tea does sound nice.
10220,Howard,how about now?
8174,Howard,"i don’t know. a couple of days ago. the thing is, bernadette doesn’t like that i have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust bernadette."
10223,Howard,there’s no way this is sixty feet.
10225,Howard,"that’s your help? that’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
8181,Howard,isn’t that great?
10230,Howard,but it’s for a good cause. what about all the kids that’ll be there?
8186,Howard,yep. i moved out of my mother’s house. cord is cut. i’m all yours.
10239,Howard,"okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about mars."
