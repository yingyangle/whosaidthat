9126,Bart,"do you know who else was really into rowboats? jesus. and he could've turned his rowboat into a jet ski, but he didn't. good guy."
9127,Bart,those bullies are gonna kill me! why am i doing this?
9128,Bart,"oh, yeah."
938,Bart,"oh, come on, i've seen you cry a million times. you cry when you scrape your knee. you cry when they're out of chocolate milk. you cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
9132,Bart,no angle.
941,Bart,are you sure you want to do this?
942,Bart,how are we going to find her?
946,Bart,"we were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
9144,Bart,sorry i'm late. i didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
953,Bart,not really. we peeked inside while you were in the john.
9146,Bart,we should be safe from milhouse here. being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.
956,Bart,"much obliged, doll."
9148,Bart,"milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?"
958,Bart,"oh, i dreamt it was the last day of school."
960,Bart,"you know, a pinch is more traditional."
962,Bart,but dad...
9155,Bart,you're right. i've gotta straighten this out.
964,Bart,now let's see what we got here.
967,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, i hope you'll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition. in some cases, still in their original wrappings."
9159,Bart,"milhouse, whaddaya say to a make-up prank?"
969,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, if i don't get at least a c average i can't go to kamp krusty."
970,Bart,you bet. check out this hand. all aces!
974,Bart,so i won't get to go to camp?
975,Bart,you mean i can go?
979,Bart,"no, but..."
9172,Bart,"we'd like some balsa wood, please."
9175,Bart,no! stop the hovering!
9177,Bart,"why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. in the words of oscar wilde: ""experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes."" i saw him too, dad."
9179,Bart,"wait, wait, wait. you're putting us in a new school?! what about my friends?"
9181,Bart,"not to worry, at this school, we've got a clean slate. in fact, i'm establishing my cred right now."
9185,Bart,"que pasa, ladies?"
9186,Bart,"don't tell anyone, but my sister lisa is best friends with alaska nebraska."
995,Bart,"i just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. can i say ""crappy"" on tv?"
9187,Bart,duh. she said that because she respects alaska's privacy. just as i have no doubt you guys will respect lisa's privacy.
1000,Bart,oh yeah.
1001,Bart,doh-kay.
9192,Bart,"milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it."
1004,Bart,are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
1008,Bart,"hey, look at me! i'm blanche dubois!"
9200,Bart,don't be afraid of them. they're just lame-os like yourself.
1012,Bart,"""resting"" hung over, ""resting"" got fired..? help me out here."
9207,Bart,"no, booze. first the easy part: kids, get some liquor."
9209,Bart,you look tired. maybe you need some more coffee.
9211,Bart,"all thanks to... ""the answer""!"
9218,Bart,oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. i can check up on the old girl. she probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.
1028,Bart,uh-oh.
9220,Bart,it's the movie. it's so funny.
9221,Bart,sorry. sorry.
9222,Bart,"mrs. k., you've gotta get outta here. when was the last time you washed your hair?"
1035,Bart,"you know, i was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure."
9231,Bart,"hey... ""just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
1041,Bart,"hey, i'm starting to think i can win."
9233,Bart,"look, mrs. k, i'm a simpson. and a simpson never gives up until he's tried at least one easy thing. let me help you."
1046,Bart,hey homer - where's your present?
1047,Bart,great caesar's ghost! a talking krusty doll!
1048,Bart,"oh, dad, this is the best birthday i've ever had."
9238,Bart,eh? eh? eh?
9240,Bart,my pleasure.
9241,Bart,"beats me, i just gave him a banana."
1052,Bart,"grampa, why don't you tell us a story? you've led an interesting life."
9243,Bart,"well, i guess i can tell you... 'cause everything worked out for the best..."
9246,Bart,but this place was your dream!
1055,Bart,"well, most of it."
9255,Bart,"...so you see, it was my fault. i got mrs. krabappel drunk. and then i was gonna do the same thing to zack, but i decided it was better to just tell the truth."
1064,Bart,"zabar, kresge, caldor, walmart!"
9257,Bart,i didn't. i swear!
1072,Bart,shh! tv!
1074,Bart,poison pizza.
1075,Bart,now's our chance to be bad.
1076,Bart,"i'm starving! somebody bring me some food, quick!"
1078,Bart,"yeah, right. like you're gonna let me go hungry. i'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
1079,Bart,"just more of me to love, honey."
1085,Bart,sucker.
9277,Bart,"hey, lis."
1093,Bart,"well, you could punish me, but..."
9289,Bart,"yeah, 'cause you're smart. you don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" like mom and dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""
9291,Bart,"""ding-dong-ditch"" means you kill her, then you throw that ding-dong into a ditch. geez, pick up a book."
9294,Bart,slice her like a bagel!
9295,Bart,i've been waiting for you -- and trying to figure out how girls pee.
9296,Bart,"no dice -- either take care of krabappel, or groundskeeper willie will say he saw you kill miss hoover."
1107,Bart,"i'm not licked yet. i can entertain myself. no matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
9299,Bart,"go ahead, do it. you're no different from me. we're made from the same dinna."
9300,Bart,the munchers got moe!
1111,Bart,it's just not the same.
9303,Bart,a hamburger!
1113,Bart,"one for ""itchy and scratchy""."
9305,Bart,let's play a game: who gets to carry the chosen one?
1116,Bart,come on. what d'ya say?
9309,Bart,eyes it is.
1118,Bart,itchy.
9310,Bart,"hey, lis. want some soup?"
9311,Bart,"quit dragging me. when i grow up, i'm gonna drag you around and buy you clothes."
9315,Bart,and i'm having a stink bomb party at the house next to janey's. no connection.
9328,Bart,what the?
1143,Bart,i bet you don't know this one. how'd you like a hertz donut?
1144,Bart,oh.
9335,Bart,really? does obama know about this?
1146,Bart,huh?
1148,Bart,i'll never wash this hand again.
1149,Bart,"sorry, lis, i no longer control the hand. the hand controls me."
9340,Bart,"i don't need a brother. i'm a badass loner like wolverine, who leaves whenever people beg him not to leave."
9341,Bart,i don't need a brother... and no dream will convince me i do.
9343,Bart,dad... i want a baby brother.
1153,Bart,yes i am. and it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
9349,Bart,hope you saved room for passion fruit soufflé with crème anglais for two.
1159,Bart,whoa.
1163,Bart,how did you know?
1164,Bart,i'm here to see my grampa.
9358,Bart,mom'll never know...
9359,Bart,"i just wanted a baby brother, but dad said i was one ""uday"" who didn't need a ""qusay."" i just wanted what lisa and maggie have."
9362,Bart,another sister!
1175,Bart,how can you like that guy?
9369,Bart,"are you from the orphanage, or do i really not understand how babies are born?"
9370,Bart,"so, charlie, how did you escape the island of misfit boys?"
1182,Bart,that's your outlaw?
1183,Bart,as usual. a knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
9375,Bart,babies? we've got one of those. overrated.
9378,Bart,you're gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.
9379,Bart,"yo! check out my brother, charlie!"
1190,Bart,stop it right now.
9384,Bart,"awesome -- they made a sequel to ""sever four!"" this movie's gonna be great! full of blood and gore and torture and guts and..."
1194,Bart,"hey, what was my first word?"
9387,Bart,...and bones and saws and lungs and faces worn as hats...
9388,Bart,"now you probably think sever five is a rip-off of sever four, but it's actually based on the rich history of hong kong torture films."
9391,Bart,there's no such thing as a boogeyman!
1203,Bart,hi yo!
9395,Bart,i'unno.
1206,Bart,"bye-bye, keys."
9398,Bart,how did you find us?
1208,Bart,"heh, heh, heh."
9401,Bart,snow. god's cotton candy.
1211,Bart,"down came the rain, and washed the spider out."
1212,Bart,"i could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. go my pretties... kill, kill!"
1219,Bart,"quiet, biet, diet, ziet, fiet..."
9414,Bart,"okay, i need the stupid lamb back."
1225,Bart,"can you say ""david hasselhoff""?"
9418,Bart,put the rope in your teeth!
9419,Bart,it'll shut you up!
1230,Bart,can i have a lolly-pop?
9422,Bart,there's rats in my pants!
9426,Bart,sewer cats!
1235,Bart,stupid mailman... squeal on me...
1238,Bart,sufferin' succotash! you can talk!
9433,Bart,"hey, don't listen to me! what do i know about rainbows?!"
9436,Bart,that is so fake. you can see the strap on the horn!
9437,Bart,poor krusty. he's become the lowest form of life -- a sidekick.
1253,Bart,you rule intensive care!
9450,Bart,what are you talking about?
9451,Bart,milhouse van houten...will you do me the honor of ruining krusty's wedding with me?
9453,Bart,i locked him in the torah room.
1263,Bart,yee-hawww!
9456,Bart,"and his last wife, eartha kitt, recorded this before her untimely death."
9457,Bart,"can i just ask, who the hell says potato?"
1266,Bart,uh... dad?
9460,Bart,"not from me, you didn't."
9463,Bart,ow! there's a big box in here!
1273,Bart,"hey homer, this luggage is crushing me."
1274,Bart,counting game.
1275,Bart,eh.
9467,Bart,there's money in this tree. what the hell is going on?
9469,Bart,"look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. you work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
1278,Bart,"to get to duff gardens, i'd ride with satan himself."
1279,Bart,"it won't be any fun without you, dad."
9471,Bart,wait!
9474,Bart,"rich kids don't need school! when i grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super."
1285,Bart,wow!
9477,Bart,"well actually, mom--"
9484,Bart,make a fire! be scared of the fire! evolve! evolve! get religious about a bird you see! sprain your ankle and know it's a death sentence!
1293,Bart,stop the ride!!!
9488,Bart,"hey, hey, hey. let's not get crazy. if you quit, i'm telling mom everything."
9490,Bart,"hey milhouse, want a turn pulling my rickshaw?"
1299,Bart,homer simpson! homer simpson! pick up bart! pick up bart!
9492,Bart,"exciting, exciting. i just have one question: is curling a real thing?"
1305,Bart,bart's dad has really pulled himself together.
9500,Bart,"lisa, i know everything about addiction that you can learn from watching dad. the first thing you have to do is get clean, so give me your pins. all of them."
9501,Bart,"eh, it's a little more like soft hate."
1318,Bart,uh-oh. better not let him see me.
1320,Bart,who the hell is pepi?
1324,Bart,"this is all my fault, dad. i didn't want you to get hurt."
1325,Bart,wait! i've got an idea!
9518,Bart,sixth-graders! nooooooo!
1330,Bart,yeah.
9523,Bart,"so, can i deliver that to the office for you?"
9524,Bart,yes!
1334,Bart,"all right, special holiday meal."
1338,Bart,that's funny for so many reasons. we have to go to that show.
9530,Bart,focused...
9534,Bart,"wow, how does this show stay so fresh?"
9536,Bart,hey lis. mom and dad just told me two different things. how is that possible?
9537,Bart,wait a minute. can i play them against each other so i don't have to do any homework at all?
1346,Bart,"hey, girls. check out this president."
1349,Bart,"hasta la vista, abie."
1350,Bart,"you're next, chester a. arthur!"
9541,Bart,if you say so.
9543,Bart,the violence really relaxes me.
1353,Bart,why are you saying that?
1354,Bart,the kind that help our olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence?
1355,Bart,i thought i'd investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.
9545,Bart,"hey, at least i'm on a path."
1362,Bart,aaahhh!
9554,Bart,it's weird -- i just made an entire town lose its lunch...
1364,Bart,ow... ow... ow!
1371,Bart,step right up folks! we'll answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages. can hamsters fly planes?
1374,Bart,you know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? that's a kid's tooth.
1378,Bart,"oh no, i can't see! i'm blind! blind!"
9575,Bart,"oh look at you, opening a book so you won't have to talk to me. well i'm just gonna be tuning up the old armpit."
1384,Bart,moron.
9577,Bart,"oh man, you girls ruin everything -- even vampires."
9578,Bart,"no, they're all about chomping neck. and they don't put product in their hair like this loser."
9579,Bart,can i draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my sharpie?
9580,Bart,"annnnd, finished."
9582,Bart,"anyway, i'm really hoping you could... dad?"
1395,Bart,and there's one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don't think we'll ever forget.
9588,Bart,"whoa, she boards, too?"
9589,Bart,it's not my fault -- grampa told me to kiss her!
9590,Bart,"if i talk to nikki, i'm sure i can--"
9594,Bart,"oh, look at their guts."
9598,Bart,what the hell are you doing?
1407,Bart,what are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
9601,Bart,"yeah, till they find out about us."
1413,Bart,lie in the snow and count to sixty.
1416,Bart,how about a barber shop?
9611,Bart,krav ma-wha?
1423,Bart,"hey grampa, we need to know your first name."
9625,Bart,ka-ra-té!
1434,Bart,"hey, i think i can squeeze through that vent."
9632,Bart,mom! i'm gonna go hurl rotten fruit!
1441,Bart,"how about ""beans, beans, the musical fruit?"""
1446,Bart,cool.
9641,Bart,"oh lisa, you take the fun out of everything! i am so glad i am not your kid."
1450,Bart,a book?
9642,Bart,"you should be. if i was in your tummy, i'd poo in your throat."
1452,Bart,"""hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for: 'a man can stand up...'"" wow."
1458,Bart,people of springfield! whacking day is a sham!
1459,Bart,it was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the irish.
9651,Bart,"who's carrying fifty times her weight? ooo, you are!"
9653,Bart,"do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? or let her die in captivity, like grampa?"
9654,Bart,"goodbye, annie, my eight-legged friend."
1465,Bart,... flintstones' chewable morphine.
1466,Bart,morphine
9658,Bart,carrot cake?!
1469,Bart,"don't worry, mom. i'll bust ya outta there just as soon as i get a cocktail dress and a crowbar."
1470,Bart,fresh!
1475,Bart,"we flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway and now we have to feed it."
9667,Bart,getting higher and higher...
9670,Bart,"come on, toilet! if you can handle dad, you can handle this!"
9674,Bart,scuba goggles!
1484,Bart,yes they do.
9683,Bart,not perfect?! you can say that again.
1495,Bart,of course.
9687,Bart,"he sure nailed you, lis."
1497,Bart,"smart bunnies, hef. i can call you hef, can't i?"
1500,Bart,krusty! we've got great news!
1502,Bart,"that's alright, krusty."
9694,Bart,you rebel scum make me sick! this is sweet justice for how you greybacks treated our boys at andersonville!
9695,Bart,hyaa! hyaa!

9696,Bart,"i need some cash, man."
9700,Bart,cookies!
9701,Bart,oh come on. what kind of big fat moron would fall for...
1512,Bart,no talking like a grizzled 1890's prospector... consarnit!
9709,Bart,sideshow bob!
1519,Bart,"man, that's some story."
1523,Bart,i'm going to kill you.
9717,Bart,shut up.
9719,Bart,"""harmless world,"" ""mild manners,"" ""not mad magazine,"" ""nap fancy,"" ""calm,"" ""comfortable,"" a ""cuddly puppies"" calendar..."
9728,Bart,the cascades?! they totally stole the federal cup from us last year! can i go mom? can i?
9732,Bart,you could just rent it till the market recovers... which'll be never!
9733,Bart,"come on, bob, you don't need to kill me. i'll probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things i do. oh no, i swallowed my tongue."
9734,Bart,"you know, the great ones can kill without explaining."
1546,Bart,"you the man, homer."
1560,Bart,"hey, apu, this bag of ice has a head in it."
1565,Bart,they become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
9766,Bart,lisa?!
9769,Bart,"fine, you can be our coach."
1581,Bart,"you believe me, don't you? you're my friend who believes me! sweet, trustworthy milhouse."
1587,Bart,"we had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. so we just threw something together with vampires. enjoy!"
1588,Bart,"but, you didn't get any on m..."
9780,Bart,"you know, lis, i'm glad i'm not playing baseball anymore. i think i'm more interested in soccer!"
1591,Bart,big deal. it's no different from the basement in grampa's rest home.
9785,Bart,"y'know mom, after only seven hours in this amusement park, i'm finally enjoying myself. i'm actually starting to forget about..."
9786,Bart,hey lis.
9787,Bart,"sorry sis, i've moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over."
1597,Bart,"come join us, lisa. it's so cool! you get to stay up all night drinking blood!"
9790,Bart,did i make it?
1600,Bart,maybe it's the tv.
9793,Bart,milhouse! do we have enough points for a weapons upgrade?
1604,Bart,blast that infernal card! don't give that card to me.
1611,Bart,i can't believe it!
1612,Bart,look at me! /
9806,Bart,how do we make this stop?
9814,Bart,there comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
1623,Bart,i 'unno.
9816,Bart,that's it. from now on we'll just play hangman.
1625,Bart,earth to boring guy.
9819,Bart,"hey, what's that weird look on all those girls' faces?"
9829,Bart,"i'm just whistlin', man."
1639,Bart,eep.
9832,Bart,school bus!
9834,Bart,you're just imagining things.
9835,Bart,hm.
9836,Bart,what does your note say?
1645,Bart,maybe a plane exploded.
1647,Bart,just make it happen.
1648,Bart,wowww... that's good squishee.
9841,Bart,milhouse couldn't beat me up.
1650,Bart,"springfield, springfield--!"
9845,Bart,it's not milhouse!
1654,Bart,"oh, no. i must have joined the junior campers!"
1656,Bart,"okay look, i made a terrible mistake. i wandered into a junior camper recruitment center. but what's done is done. i've made my bed and now i've got to weasel out of it."
9853,Bart,my poop stick has brought him back to life! but which end?
1663,Bart,"hel-lo, alternative to testing!"
1664,Bart,nooo!
9855,Bart,"c'mon, man, leave me alone."
9857,Bart,"this is too weird, man."
1668,Bart,"aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?"
9864,Bart,"dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!"
9866,Bart,"ask about the safe. no, better yet, act like you know about the safe."
1676,Bart,"you know-it-know it, neddy."
1689,Bart,"hey, wait! i smell hamburgers too."
1690,Bart,"you did it, dad! you saved us! i'm proud you're my father."
1698,Bart,"whoa, what the hell..."
1699,Bart,what is this place?
9893,Bart,what about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
1703,Bart,woo hoo! jackpot!
1706,Bart,"ah yeah, welcome... have a lucky day... um hmmm."
1707,Bart,"hey, how's it goin'?... hey, good to see you... tell your friends. lookin' lucky... hey, what's happenin'? love the jacket."
9902,Bart,"for the last three years, i've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike. and all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that i immediately broke and threw in this bag."
1712,Bart,the burglar even took my stamp collection.
9904,Bart,"great, mom. now i lost track of my pump count. one pump, two pump..."
9905,Bart,"bowl full of jelly, pump lead in his belly..."
9907,Bart,"some ""express."""
9908,Bart,we're flying!
9909,Bart,"excuse me, mister goblin?"
1720,Bart,"we're having a field trip today. ah, lis, won't it be great to cast off the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is springfield elementary? oh, i'm sorry, i forgot. your class isn't going."
1724,Bart,"damn tv, you've ruined my imagination just like you've ruined my ability to... to um, uh... oh well."
9918,Bart,"listen here, kringle. i may have been naughty this year. but by today's standards, naughty's nothing. i didn't get anybody pregnant, i didn't facebook a kid to death... make with my dirt bike!"
9921,Bart,you don't have to do that. i have socks. i'll give you socks!
9922,Bart,yours.
1731,Bart,yoink!
9927,Bart,we brought you breakfast in bed!
1737,Bart,"yes, krusty?"
1738,Bart,"i saved your career, man! remember your comeback special?"
1739,Bart,i got you that danish.
1741,Bart,cool!
1746,Bart,"dad, i'm asking if i can get a job."
1747,Bart,"wow, being in show business is like a dream. we're really lucky, aren't we?"
1751,Bart,i wish i was dead.
9943,Bart,"it's agreed -- no biting, no throwing rocks, no face farts, flying face farts, backdoor haircuts, 'nad noogies, moist michaels, and absolutely no ""brazilian hardwood."""
9945,Bart,then let's do this thing!
9947,Bart,when did this happen?
1756,Bart,i am waiting for a bus.
9949,Bart,"mom, do you have any idea how i got this scar?"
9953,Bart,there's nothing cooler than calling yourself cool.
1770,Bart,do the line. just do the line. what's gonna happen to me?
9962,Bart,"you're not the chicken, i'm the chicken!"
9964,Bart,they dared me to see how many tv remotes i could stick in my mouth.
1774,Bart,the best performance of my life.
9968,Bart,"all right, comic book guy, tell me my origin story."
1778,Bart,what happened?
9973,Bart,"i go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy."
1783,Bart,"yeah, delicious corn."
1784,Bart,and he taught me how to do this.
9978,Bart,"what am i doin' here, seymour? the thing i'm planning hasn't even gone off yet."
9980,Bart,"oh yeah, her. classic space case."
1790,Bart,how about me?
9983,Bart,"okay, have fun dying alone."
1792,Bart,"wendy windbag? ""ugly doris""? ""hortense: the mule-faced doll""?"
9985,Bart,"come on, come to life! i swear i'll be cool about it."
1797,Bart,"oh no, not another boring space launch! change the channel! change the channel!"
9991,Bart,stupid cheap bike! to think i was gonna put fenders on you.
1800,Bart,yeah.
1806,Bart,hey.
1808,Bart,"no way, josé !"
10000,Bart,"lis, i've gotta talk to you."
10002,Bart,how can i earn money to buy the world's most awesome thing?
1811,Bart,yeah!
10007,Bart,"it's me, willie. bart simpson."
1816,Bart,"uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, mom."
10009,Bart,"uh, dad. if we could get to the reward...?"
10011,Bart,yes they were! but now they won't be! because i don't have a mini-bike!
1820,Bart,"can't tie up the line, grampa."
1823,Bart,where's my elephant?!
10016,Bart,i don't know... can i really betray my country? i say the pledge of allegiance every day.
1826,Bart,"eh, either way."
10019,Bart,"they will be if you're in 'em, pops."
10026,Bart,"masters, i can explain."
10027,Bart,a teddy bear?
10029,Bart,"you know, dad, i really did have a good time hanging out with you."
1839,Bart,"g'night, stampy."
10036,Bart,can we close the door?
1845,Bart,you guys don't understand stampy. he's just like me. we're a pair of jokers and both of us are wild. we don't take nothin' from nobody.
1846,Bart,"no, dad, he's my friend!"
1848,Bart,"don't worry, stampy. i won't let homer sell you to that ivory dealer."
1849,Bart,"you and i are gonna run away together. we'll keep to the back roads, and make our way south. then, if i know my geography, it's just twelve miles to africa. okay bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through..."
10040,Bart,"hey dad, did you color your hair too?"
1854,Bart,"ahhh. you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?"
10049,Bart,"oh, man. what can we do?"
1863,Bart,"ah, thanks, boy."
1864,Bart,"whoa! whoa, boy!"
10055,Bart,name one more.
10063,Bart,uh... nobody. wrong number.
1872,Bart,well...
10066,Bart,"conductor, get ready to play my song!"
1877,Bart,"hey, wait! how can you be here when your show's on live?"
1878,Bart,"...and i had the greatest time. mr. burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit."
10074,Bart,either the grave or somewhere much worse.
10075,Bart,fine. how's it goin'?
1887,Bart,for me? but i don't know how to drive.
1892,Bart,that's them all right. i can't believe it. i guess you're the only one i can trust...
10084,Bart,don't player hate. i'm just a businessboy.
10087,Bart,"...which i may have already spent, ironically, on these novelty eyeglasses."
10094,Bart,"and homer, he is back with mom / you can watch this tomorrow at hulu.com."
1903,Bart,"not likely. c'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
1905,Bart,"mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. what is it with you?"
10101,Bart,why did i agree to moderate this teleconference?
1911,Bart,"i thought i'd be jumping for joy the day skinner left, but now all i have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
10103,Bart,good for you. no more drinkin'?
10109,Bart,fill the board then wash my car.
1924,Bart,"don't you see, milhouse? we've gone too far. we need skinner back."
1935,Bart,so i guess we're enemies again.
1938,Bart,"a prison bus, otto?"
10137,Bart,how many verses does this song have?
1946,Bart,"look, if i was under seventeen, i'd be in school, right?"
10139,Bart,"i'll assume that means ""yes."""
10143,Bart,lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! i'm the one that got a magic set for christmas two years ago.
1952,Bart,i'm one of your nephews you don't see very often. bart-bart.
1957,Bart,"oh, yeah. right."
10154,Bart,hey -- you licked the back! that was my side!
10157,Bart,only you can make tree poop boring.
1967,Bart,"keep up the good work, toots."
1969,Bart,"mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but i know he's innocent?"
1970,Bart,"mom, mom, mom!"
10162,Bart,how big?
1973,Bart,and that's what really happened.
1977,Bart,don't forget to give her smeckler's powder!
1986,Bart,um... that's me.
10179,Bart,i already do! it's too close to christmas!
10180,Bart,not to worry.
1995,Bart,"very well, you leave me no choice."
10190,Bart,i hear he goes to california on his vacations.
2002,Bart,"yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company in it."
10195,Bart,are you nuts?! let's have some fun!
10197,Bart,let's start with a little federal crime.
10200,Bart,the last place anybody would expect to see a moon: the sky!
2009,Bart,"look, dad. i missed you so much, i couldn't concentrate in school and i got an ""f""."
10207,Bart,original or three-sixty?
2018,Bart,it is?!!
10211,Bart,does it look like... this?
2023,Bart,"faithful milhouse. you'll spend the long, hot days by my side, won't you?"
10221,Bart,"mrs. k., i'm here to spring you."
2030,Bart,i swear i don't know where the bombs are! only the miners know that! maybe this will loosen your tongue! no! blah!!
10222,Bart,you didn't do that.
10227,Bart,"see ya tomorrow, teach."
10229,Bart,even on snow days?
2041,Bart,can't be what it looks like. this is flanders we're talkin' about.
10237,Bart,"wait, this tastes different."
10241,Bart,i admit it! i let milhouse lie down in your bed!
2052,Bart,"of course. oh no. he's back. flanders is back! lisa, get outta there!"
10247,Bart,i'm mrs. knickertwist! and i've had a proper hardy-har at your expense!
2056,Bart,"i'll save you, cast or no cast!"
10248,Bart,...stacks of resumes in back seat...
10249,Bart,"same garbage, different dumpster."
10250,Bart,"dollar bill guy, five dollar bill guy, sex guy, will ferrell, black guy."
10255,Bart,"man, teddy roosevelt killed more spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives!"
2064,Bart,"lisa, will you keep it down!? i'm making a crank phone call to principal skinner."
10265,Bart,balderdash! teddy roosevelt protected america's wildlife!
2074,Bart,note for later. put rubber spider down lisa's dress.
10267,Bart,"and on july first, 1898, colonel theodore roosevelt and his band of rough riders charged up san juan hill and liberated cuba."
2076,Bart,"suit yourself. but if you change your mind, here's my card."
10269,Bart,chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
2081,Bart,uh oh!
2083,Bart,"well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the french say, ""bartesque."""
10279,Bart,taking over the school. with all the kids inside!
10283,Bart,"yo, teachwads! the brotherhood of the spectacles has taken over the school!"
2092,Bart,"you're a shoo-in now, lis."
10287,Bart,thanks. but these rough riders aren't dismounting until you get your job back.
2101,Bart,what happened to mindy?
10294,Bart,can his funeral be on a school day?
2103,Bart,"a-a-a-a-and, now."
2106,Bart,i learned it screws everybody up.
10305,Bart,"how is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time?"
2116,Bart,ow!
2118,Bart,"i was just ordering a cheeseburger, mom. they have violent names for everything here."
2123,Bart,"i don't know, disgruntled goat had his moments."
10316,Bart,check it out.
2128,Bart,"yeah. there's just no way to resist it, is there?"
2130,Bart,i'll get more cameras!
2132,Bart,sideshow bob! i'm only ten and i already got two mortal enemies.
10324,Bart,"games don't have lives or points anymore, dad."

2145,Bart,kindergarten?
2146,Bart,triangle.
2150,Bart,how the hell do you know?
10347,Bart,where's dad?
10349,Bart,we ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
2163,Bart,"don't worry, mom. i can use my ""shinning"" to call willie."
2167,Bart,"join us, father."
2168,Bart,"hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. let's kill it."
10359,Bart,a zephyr?
2177,Bart,"all right, ""thinks too much,"" it shall be so."
2180,Bart,"why the crap do we have to go to church, anyway?"
10378,Bart,"but lis, when this book comes out, you'll be beloved! not just by milhouses, you'll get attention from jacksons, xanders -- even aidens!"
10380,Bart,yeah?
2194,Bart,no i'm not. i'm really...
2195,Bart,three months .

10399,Bart,forget it.
2209,Bart,"hey, jessica."
10401,Bart,"""but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then jo found her promise very hard to keep."""
2211,Bart,why?
10405,Bart,nice save.
10406,Bart,"""...and amy and jo hugged one another close, and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss."" end of chapter eight."
2215,Bart,just give me two minutes.
2216,Bart,"jessica, i think this is too steep."
2217,Bart,"actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, i just might be able to hold on."
2220,Bart,nooooo!
10413,Bart,i like the early closing time.
2223,Bart,"she's like a milk dud, lis. sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."
10420,Bart,who cares what we look like in whatever stupid year this is?
2230,Bart,"well, jessica, i don't think we should hang out together anymore. you're turning me into a criminal when all i want to be is a petty thug."
2233,Bart,i...
2236,Bart,we've gotta talk.
10429,Bart,perfect.
2238,Bart,that doesn't make any sense.
2240,Bart,"you know, with the way you're treating me, why should i protect you?"
10432,Bart,could there be anyone awesomer?
10433,Bart,i love that guy.
2244,Bart,that's okay. 'preciate it... mm hmm.
10437,Bart,we totally wasted his time.
10443,Bart,a thousand kids?! if you could get each of them to send you a dollar you'd be a millionaire!
2252,Bart,"lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist."
10445,Bart,we don't need your website. we can make anything into guns.
2255,Bart,of course she did. who else would have?
10449,Bart,milhouse!
2266,Bart,"maybe i will, milhouse, maybe i will."
2269,Bart,"i dunno, mom."
2271,Bart,"hello, queen lisa."
2272,Bart,"lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. at first i thought we can talk it over like civilized people. but instead, i just ripped the head off mr. honeybunny."
10466,Bart,ay carumba!
2279,Bart,"uh uh, lisa started it."
10474,Bart,something like that.
2283,Bart,"hey, mom! look at me, mom!"
10476,Bart,"according to the wisdom of our elders...if you go all the way around on the swing, your body will turn inside-out."
10478,Bart,"legend has it a girl named eleanor mackie drowned on this very spot. now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror, you will die. milhouse?"
2287,Bart,please the hobo. please the hobo. please the hobo.
10481,Bart,i can't be the guy who killed everybody's fun. that's skinner's job.
10482,Bart,"milhouse, i've just figured out a way to make school cool again."
10483,Bart,i have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of groundskeeper were-willie.
2293,Bart,"hey lis, i found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
2297,Bart,"we know you're innocent, dad."
2300,Bart,mom!! dad!!
10499,Bart,lenny lenford. you're a long way from your barstool.
10503,Bart,"open mine! quick, before it suffocates!"
2313,Bart,thank you.
2315,Bart,"no offense, homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
2317,Bart,"cheer up, homer."
2325,Bart,i don't believe it! principal skinner!
10520,Bart,the jerk in the glasses did everything!
2329,Bart,"a conspiracy, eh? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way?"
10521,Bart,"oh god, man! here, drink this paint thinner."
2331,Bart,"dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore grampa?"
2332,Bart,maybe we should be listening to him now.
10522,Bart,what was that name again?
10528,Bart,count me in.
2337,Bart,wow. two.
2338,Bart,oh please.
10530,Bart,"i carumba? not so loud! if my dad hears about the show, he might realize mr. fatso is him!"
2340,Bart,you're a pin-monkey? wow. finally i don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.
2344,Bart,"dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight."
2349,Bart,and you've never found anything?
10548,Bart,"isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?"
2358,Bart,so what am i supposed to do exactly?
10552,Bart,not me when i hit the dance floor!
10553,Bart,in your dreams!
2363,Bart,"observatory? this is bart simpson. i see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven."
2364,Bart,what didn't i do.
10557,Bart,"company physical coming up, huh?"

2392,Bart,"i know i've seen it go the other way. ah, faithful toilet. you'll prove me right."
10587,Bart,"listen... i could get wedgied for this, but jimbo's a jerk. you can do better."
2396,Bart,"hello, southern hemisphere? which way does the water go in your toilet?"
2397,Bart,which way does the water turn in your toilet?
2402,Bart,"we understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not."
2404,Bart,"she was right. stupid lisa science queen. look, why don't you just check your neighbor's drains. i'll hold."
2405,Bart,yes. yes i do.
10597,Bart,"man, they have every entrance covered. you'd have to be a navy seal to get in or out."
10600,Bart,"well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
10601,Bart,"it's okay, dad. he's just putting the fear of god in me."
10602,Bart,monday... here we go again...

2416,Bart,nothing. some stupid country thinks i owe them money.
10609,Bart,"i sold all my stuff, and it's still not enough money for the cruise."
10612,Bart,mooooom! daaaaaad!

2422,Bart,oh.
10616,Bart,"it's weird to hear myself saying this, but... i love you guys. this is gonna be the best vacation ever!"
10617,Bart,"look, that's our ship!"
2428,Bart,"i get it, dad."
2429,Bart,that's not a knife. that's a spoon.

10639,Bart,"check it out: the gallery was gonna throw these paintings overboard, like they were worthless garbage?"
2454,Bart,dance in front of my whole school? what is it with you and ballet?
10647,Bart,"lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! mom and dad, you were more happy and in love than i ever saw you!"
10648,Bart,it was the best week of all of our lives... and i wanted it to last forever.
2460,Bart,"go ahead and laugh. but i took a chance and did something i wanted to do. and if that makes me a sissy, well then, i guess i'm a sissy."
10656,Bart,"no, you give them the coupon and they give you the hamburger."
10657,Bart,"no, you're imagining things."
10662,Bart,hitler mash-ups.
2479,Bart,oh yeah!
10671,Bart,"well, what you've gotta do is get them into the real world."
2481,Bart,"anyway, hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. i also crush cars into cubes. and on the side, i promote local tough man contests. basically i'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til i go to law school."
10672,Bart,"if you don't act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends."
10673,Bart,shut up!
2486,Bart,"i don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out."
10679,Bart,she just found out no one likes her. i thought she knew!
2492,Bart,"it looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. come on, boy, you can do it!"
2493,Bart,"hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?"
10687,Bart,"lady gaga, meet your biggest threat: baby googoo."

2506,Bart,"well, i have to coordinate, don't i?"
2507,Bart,we don't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad?
10699,Bart,"dad, can i ask you a question? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you?"
2510,Bart,"hush, puppies!"
2511,Bart,"i know, the window!"
2518,Bart,that's impossible! how did you get here first?
2519,Bart,"there! now you don't know which one is little monty! i guess if you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go, too!"
10718,Bart,"come on, let's go find mary! this is the address her brother gave me."
10719,Bart,hey!
10723,Bart,wow. what are you doin' for money?

2541,Bart,juh?
10733,Bart,"uh, well, since we're here, i'm gonna go try to get al roker's autograph."
2547,Bart,horrifying.
10742,Bart,"y'know, it's really not fair you're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover!"
2551,Bart,psst. over here.
2556,Bart,...and you're not coming out until you reach an agreement.
2557,Bart,"don't worry, they'll start negotiating."
10748,Bart,it's homer! before his boobs came in!
10753,Bart,or... my life might be a hell of a lot better!
2564,Bart,no i mean it. it really hurts!
2565,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i can't take the test. i have a stomach ache."
2566,Bart,"look, if you ignore me and i die, you'd get in a lot of trouble."
10760,Bart,"mom, how come you didn't do my homework last night?"
2571,Bart,"hello, i'm dr. cheeks. i'm doing my rounds and uh, i'm a little behind."
10763,Bart,lousy surface dwellers...
10765,Bart,"that guy has a bone to pick with the board of regents. hey, lisa's not getting on the bus."
10771,Bart,maybe i should go on anti-psychotic meds.

2584,Bart,"lisa, look what i've got!"
2585,Bart,ta-daa!
10780,Bart,i'm only down sixty-two dollars. not counting my tips to the waitresses.
10784,Bart,"oh man, this is priceless, but i can't keep it up. you've still got a college fund."
2600,Bart,this is for the ages.
10792,Bart,i know this music! it was a bugs bunny!
10798,Bart,i really think that's coming from our house.
10799,Bart,how 'bout the disney minority program?
2609,Bart,"hey, milhouse. how's the lemonade business?"
10814,Bart,"yeah it was great! this one guy was part of another guy's gang, i mean ""kkangpae,"" but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him!"
10818,Bart,"have you been ""oh boy""-ing all night?"
2634,Bart,"hello there, fellow shelbyvillians."
10830,Bart,what the hell?
10840,Bart,"c'mon, boy. time to go to bed."
2650,Bart,wait! i got it! i got it!
2651,Bart,i don't got it.
10843,Bart,"dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?"
2653,Bart,"oh, it's no use. i'm never gonna find that tree. this whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. wait a minute! there's a lemon behind that rock."
10845,Bart,dad! / come up! / pretty please! / come up!
2660,Bart,we made it!
2663,Bart,absolutely.
2667,Bart,huh? wahw!
2668,Bart,"i'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. i swear it."
10859,Bart,"hey, don't blame me -- i didn't even take the test."
10860,Bart,i had something better to do.
10863,Bart,"sorry, i can't grant a favor to someone i don't respect anymore."
10864,Bart,wheee!
2673,Bart,"no, my dog!"
2674,Bart,you twisted old monster!!
10866,Bart,nothing a few george washingtons won't solve.
10869,Bart,"well, i slept on my books, so i might have gotten something through osmosis."
10873,Bart,looks like mr. vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
10881,Bart,"lisa, i wanna pass that test, but i need your help."
2692,Bart,"thank you, thank you, thank you. it's all in the delivery. ...now is the winter of our discontent..."
10885,Bart,will you stop that?!
2694,Bart,"watch out, radioactive man!!!!!"
10888,Bart,doges?! why do we have to play this stupid game lisa likes?
2701,Bart,i just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. george burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
2706,Bart,there's the real milhouse.
10900,Bart,all you need to know is i'm a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous. ma'am.
2709,Bart,"wow. you really got it made now, milhouse. this is living."
2711,Bart,yeah. ahhh!
10905,Bart,mary spuckler!
2715,Bart,"okay, thanks."
10908,Bart,"get out of my face, cootie breath! i did miss you. you stink! come over saturday. i'm gonna have to push you in the mud now."
2721,Bart,"but milhouse! they haven't cured anything. heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. every last one of them. want results? you have to go to the schwarzeneggers, the stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the van dammes."
10913,Bart,"oh mary, you know you're the coolest person i've ever hung out with."
10924,Bart,"um... lifting people's spirits is an interesting topic. for centuries, neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits."
10926,Bart,mary? are you okay?
10930,Bart,back pats?! this is a break up!
2739,Bart,"wow, dad, you took a baptismal for me. how do you feel?"
2747,Bart,"well, if your soul's real, where is it?"
2749,Bart,"how can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? listen. you don't have a soul, i don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul."
2750,Bart,how much you got?
2751,Bart,deal.
2756,Bart,i sold my soul to milhouse.
10949,Bart,"dad, what are you watching?"
2758,Bart,"poor gullible lisa. i'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."
10953,Bart,"you're right, i'm bored. epoxy fight!"
10956,Bart,"all right, let's just use a razor."
2767,Bart,"i know that's funny, but i'm just not laughing."
2768,Bart,i am familiar with the works of pablo neruda.
10960,Bart,now sing the alphabet song!
10962,Bart,nah. back to the sweet spot.
10964,Bart,"okay, first, tone it down. time to teach you to be a man."
10966,Bart,now you're the same height as your dad.
2779,Bart,"when milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?"
10971,Bart,just one sec: nelson gave me some notes on a prank i'm doing.
2783,Bart,"yes. a simple proposition, ralph: how would you like to make a dollar?"
10975,Bart,"well, if i look at your face, i get sick."
2785,Bart,"milhouse, please."
2786,Bart,"milhouse, i gotta have my soul back. i'll do anything you want."
2788,Bart,please. you have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
10981,Bart,mine's full of hand mirrors.
2790,Bart,"are you there, god? it's me, bart simpson. i know i never paid too much attention in church, but i could really use some of that good stuff now. i'm afraid. i'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul and i don't know what they're doing to it. i just want it back. please. i hope you can hear this..."
10986,Bart,but grampa...
10988,Bart,i'll bring you home my dessert.
2801,Bart,"say what? cartoons don't have messages, lisa. they're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. stuff like that."
10997,Bart,"well sure i am. i always thought grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!"
10999,Bart,"sure, here you go."
2810,Bart,"uh, dad, lisa's the one you're not talking to."
2812,Bart,i agree. destroy the school.
2813,Bart,"well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there."
2815,Bart,"good catch, boy."
2817,Bart,yes.
11015,Bart,"yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?"
2825,Bart,"help! lisa, help!"
2826,Bart,"wait a minute... if you're here, then you've fallen asleep too!"
11021,Bart,my wha?
2834,Bart,"i'll save you, dad."
11026,Bart,"milhouse, where are you going with this?"
2839,Bart,"hi, doctor nick!"
2842,Bart,"homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
2846,Bart,"ah, dad? towel rack...?"
2849,Bart,he's a nuclear safety technician.
2852,Bart,and i think it's ironic that for once dad's butt prevented the release of toxic ga--
2855,Bart,"where have you been, granny? did they freeze you or something?"
11047,Bart,now to leave a nice clean trail of bugs out of the swamp... the frogs follow... and hooper's got a plague he can't handle.
2858,Bart,what?
2862,Bart,"look at me, gramma, i'm a hippie! peace, man! groovy! bomb vietnam! four more years! up with people!"
2866,Bart,"way to guard the parking lot, top gun."
2878,Bart,daaadd! hellllp!
2879,Bart,"are you getting a lot of bugs in your mouth, too?"
11072,Bart,and i've been wondering... not like i miss having my afternoons free or anything but... are you starting to feel better?
11074,Bart,pass.
2883,Bart,"get out of the way, krusty!"
11075,Bart,"grampa, i made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
11082,Bart,if you're worried about your mother's day present it's in the works.
2891,Bart,i've got a great idea. let's play space patrol.
2892,Bart,"maggie can be maggina, her spunky sidekick."
11083,Bart,pass.
2894,Bart,oops.
2898,Bart,"clean as a whistle, homer!"
2900,Bart,i'd sell my soul for a formula one racing car!
11093,Bart,whoopee...
11099,Bart,and now i'll always be at home in a saloon!
11100,Bart,"hi zhenya, i'm here for my lesson."
2909,Bart,"those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game."
2910,Bart,"oh, i'll never get that game."
11103,Bart,"mom, you'd still be proud of me if i couldn't play piano, right?"
2912,Bart,"mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame."
11106,Bart,i'm sorry! i was faking it!
11107,Bart,i lied so i could see zhenya.
11113,Bart,"here's your new plate, grampa."
2922,Bart,i'm outside. i got away with it! i'm free!
2928,Bart,"everything except ""capiche""..."
2930,Bart,now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
11122,Bart,mom! lisa made me break a lamp!
2935,Bart,i don't have to listen to these wild allegations.
11127,Bart,"yes it is, they're my lines as the scarecrow in ""the wizard of oz."""
2940,Bart,"wait! mom, i don't want you to see this."
2941,Bart,i did it.
11133,Bart,i'unno. 'cause you're incapable of experiencing joy?
2943,Bart,is there anything i can do?
2945,Bart,"man, i thought mom was gonna scream me stupid. she didn't even raise her voice."
2951,Bart,"milhouse, do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving you?"
2953,Bart,"hey, how come you're not playing bonestorm?"
11152,Bart,"yeah, it's like looking down a canadian tunnel."
2961,Bart,"hey, that's mom! she's happy again!"
11153,Bart,"sleep well, lis. somehow sewing my head on your shoulder brought us closer together."
11159,Bart,a brother can never be friends with his sister!
2968,Bart,i told you i don't have anything.
11161,Bart,"well, wherever i am, it's gotta be an improvement."
2970,Bart,mo-ommm...
2972,Bart,"uh, yeahhh! thanks, mom."
11165,Bart,yeah.
2975,Bart,i'll say god.
2977,Bart,"look at this! special insert -- ""iron-on mad-ness!"" ""ban the bath,"" ""don't trust anyone over ten,"" ""sock it to me""..."
11170,Bart,help! help!
11171,Bart,child in danger with exciting visuals!
2984,Bart,"wow, look at all the colors, man!"
2991,Bart,"hi!... hey, what's this?"
11184,Bart,"no, you're not. because if you tell people i cheated, that means your system failed."
2996,Bart,"did your secret service goons ever whack anybody, george?"
11190,Bart,he said he was going to work.
11195,Bart,what's wrong with the one i got?
3007,Bart,"i begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
11199,Bart,no! you never let me be mike singletary!
3013,Bart,"get him, boys!!"
11205,Bart,you don't know what rough is.
3017,Bart,wow. livin' large!
3020,Bart,i'm gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
3023,Bart,there's a special on tacos down at the the tacomat. a hundred tacos for a hundred dollars. i'm gonna get that.
3025,Bart,"really?! wow, i should've started a long time ago!"
11218,Bart,"hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected."
11223,Bart,hey lis.
11225,Bart,were you thinking it?
3035,Bart,"yeah, there'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow."
11227,Bart,"submerge! periscope! aooga! aooga! die, nazi octopus, die!"
11233,Bart,"thanks, mom. i'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is."
3043,Bart,krusty!
3052,Bart,are you rory b. bellows?
11244,Bart,"okay, i washed your car like you asked, i did your paper route, and i'm sorry. i really am. this could be the turning point of my life. where you, as a school guy, made a difference. what do you think? can i go on that sub?"
3055,Bart,and krusty's superfluous third nipple!
11248,Bart,you'll really help me get revenge?
3058,Bart,"c'mon, lis, krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity."
11253,Bart,seymour! the cops are on their way!
3063,Bart,"yeah, dad! you're a big fat loudmouth. and you can walk when you have to."
11257,Bart,thanks for stickin' up for me.
3067,Bart,"look alive, simpson! i'm not paying you to goldbrick!"
3071,Bart,makes sense to me.
11264,Bart,"i don't think you're giving them what they were promised, dad."
3074,Bart,save our seats!
11269,Bart,"what?! lis, you're smart. why would you give me a book? 'cause it's easy to wrap?"
11271,Bart,"what? no, i got it from this."
11273,Bart,now did you check the room to make sure you haven't left anything?
3082,Bart,"show some respect, man! that ""no talent"" created itchy and scratchy."
3083,Bart,huh?
11276,Bart,"if you smell your farts in a dream, you die?"
11279,Bart,"you're saying it's from maggie, but actually it's from you. thanks, lis."
3088,Bart,look at that fat oaf.
11281,Bart,"i wanna see ""radioactive man re-rises!"""
11283,Bart,who knows? but it sure is easy. i'll walk you through it. all you have to do is--
11285,Bart,i'm under thirty.
11287,Bart,i just want to know who dropped the dime on dad. lousy rat.
3099,Bart,he just needs to stay here till tomorrow. we're going down to itchy and scratchy studios to pick up his check.
11294,Bart,homer!
11297,Bart,"oh yeah, more. a little bit more. right there. oh yeah. oh yeah, that's the stuff!"
11301,Bart,"perfect. bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock."
11303,Bart,"interesting. when was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
11304,Bart,"aw, come on, mom!"
3119,Bart,"dad, can we have $183,000?"
11312,Bart,"this is what it means to everyone. how can you be forced to say ""i love you?"" people only give valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't."
11313,Bart,i rubbed it on milhouse.
11317,Bart,please!
11321,Bart,"it's been a rough patch, man. hope you got something to cheer me up."
11327,Bart,"here's your money, dad."
11329,Bart,you're the ones that paid me to eat it.
11335,Bart,this school has a falconry club? no way.
11337,Bart,you were right about watching him fly.
3146,Bart,martin.
11343,Bart,"fly! fly! c'mon, man! do the wing thing!"
3154,Bart,"uh, we don't need to stop here."
3158,Bart,what about the sunsphere?
3159,Bart,"well, we've still got a car and a wad of cash."
11351,Bart,phew!
3162,Bart,everybody remember: we're parked under the sunsphere.
3169,Bart,ssshh! they'll know you're in there!
3171,Bart,"sometimes i wonder about all the people in this town. do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? i mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there."
3172,Bart,"what do you think, milhouse? milhouse?"
3182,Bart,"well, i'm sure you'll make up something. maybe you just need more of my classmates around."
11374,Bart,what are you doing?
3184,Bart,"look, if you're going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?"
3190,Bart,"figures... hey, mr. burns!"
11382,Bart,awww...
11383,Bart,fascinating.
3194,Bart,"i can't believe you, grampa. the sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like burns! you gotta get that treasure! you gotta do it for ox and asa and griff and burnsie... well, not so much burnsie."
3195,Bart,"uh, yes. but we gotta act fast!"
11388,Bart,"""i too am not a bit tamed, i too am untranslatable""... walt whitman, ""leaves of grass""."
11393,Bart,you shut up!
3204,Bart,"you're rich, grampa! you did it! and burns can never take that away from you!"
11396,Bart,you did that for me?
11398,Bart,"a little singing? if there's one thing he did not have to genetically enhance, it's his voice."
3209,Bart,"hey, what's this one for?"
3210,Bart,"hey, apu, why don't just marry some american broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?"
3215,Bart,"dad, please. you're embarrassing us."
11409,Bart,whoa...
3218,Bart,"dear lord, if you keep homer from embarrassing us today, we promise to build several churches in your honor."
11410,Bart,ay carumba.
3222,Bart,"you know what, dad? maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
11414,Bart,are you sure you didn't create a perfect habitat for you?
11417,Bart,"no, that's a much bigger animal."
11418,Bart,but i want to see it!
3238,Bart,when the hell are we gonna get to... where the hell are we going?
3239,Bart,i thought springfield was america's scrod-basket.
3241,Bart,last one in is a yearbook editor!
11433,Bart,"i'm just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever. eh, why not?"
3243,Bart,hot stuff comin' through!
3244,Bart,my friendship. you know you want it.
11434,Bart,you weren't lisa's hero. she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
11438,Bart,"hi, dad! / homer."
3249,Bart,fresh out.
3250,Bart,"oh, this is the worst fourth of july ever. i hate america! come on, milhouse, let's go down there."
11442,Bart,wha-- what are you doing in here?
11448,Bart,nice real estate. you've got a deal.
3264,Bart,look inside.
11456,Bart,"i have a feeling this playstadium was ""liberated"" from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude."
11458,Bart,what the?
11459,Bart,"oh, yawn. another freebie. better be a sixty-four gig."
11462,Bart,i helped snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. it was an honorable arrangement. but i never thought he'd steal from you.
3272,Bart,w-w-what do you want from me?
11465,Bart,careful. it's uncut syrup. they give it to horses before they race.
11466,Bart,you ratted him out? he's got a kid!
3277,Bart,"hey, dad."
11470,Bart,you're going straight?
3279,Bart,that nerds conduct electricity.
3292,Bart,"two, wintim amd jawwy wirt..."
3293,Bart,"um, well, i know hell and damn and bi--"
3294,Bart,i know of them.
3295,Bart,"so, what are you in for?"
3297,Bart,"look, lady, i'm s'posed to be in the fourth grade."
3301,Bart,hey dad...
3304,Bart,"hey, lis, check out this space age toothbrush."
11503,Bart,"hm, maybe i can help. but it'll cost you."
3313,Bart,"way to go, dad! take those punches!"
3316,Bart,isn't dad the one in the black trunks?
11511,Bart,aren't those full of germs?
3323,Bart,more food.
3325,Bart,"no, dad! shoot your way out!"
3326,Bart,woo hoo!
11518,Bart,whoa! they like each other!
3328,Bart,shall we say ten?
11522,Bart,roll in hay!
11523,Bart,roll in hay!
3333,Bart,"milhouse, this is boring. make it crash or something!"
11527,Bart,dad!
3337,Bart,"no, no!... he... help!... i'm gonna die!..."
3338,Bart,"you're the man, homer."
11529,Bart,culture's in decline! deal with it!
3341,Bart,"lady, i gotta tell ya -- i have been grossly misinformed about witches."
3346,Bart,"oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss. no problemo."
11540,Bart,mother's day?!
3350,Bart,"heh. nudist colonies are everywhere these days. i'd love to go, but i... i can't get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!"
3354,Bart,nope.
3355,Bart,yup.
3356,Bart,she did.
11546,Bart,that's good.
3358,Bart,"dad, we can't let this happen to belle! do something!"
3359,Bart,"to shut them down now would be twisted,"
11554,Bart,why would a kitten marry a crocodile? wouldn't it eat her?
3364,Bart,"hey, this ain't the ritz."
11557,Bart,"yeah, yeah. thank you, mel. but i am not here to talk about myself. milhouse, would you join me at the podium?"
11558,Bart,"i've gotta set things straight. during that same race, my friend milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened..."
11560,Bart,"grampa, everyone's callin' me a coward."
3369,Bart,who's chase?
11562,Bart,but don't people hate cowards?
11565,Bart,i understand. you have standards.
3375,Bart,"hey, lis, mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- whoa, lisa! look out! nelson's in our house!"
3376,Bart,"are you nuts? i'll probably never say this to you again, but you can do better."
11569,Bart,"look, maggie. i undid my deed. so i'm just gonna take your feather and say goodnight."
11570,Bart,where are these coming from?
3379,Bart,spin the middle side topwise. topwise.
3380,Bart,lisa and i built your room.
11574,Bart,"hey, dad! we made popcorn!"
3383,Bart,i am shocked and appalled.
11575,Bart,chief wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers.
11581,Bart,"hey, krusty."
3391,Bart,"so anyway, i says to mabel, i says..."
11586,Bart,"well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet."
3396,Bart,we love you boy!
3397,Bart,"hey, dad. what's the word from planet crackpot?"
3404,Bart,and that is how much college will cost for maggie!
3405,Bart,"you know, dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. i've really had a great time out here."
11596,Bart,the sit is on.
11598,Bart,no.
3411,Bart,i'll handle this.
11603,Bart,where are we?
3413,Bart,"hey, what's going on?! wait, wait! hey, let go of me!..."
11604,Bart,no.
11605,Bart,we've been kidnapped!
11613,Bart,"just like you taught me, captain. over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch."
11616,Bart,dad! we can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse!
3425,Bart,"hey, i'm not gonna get fired. is there any gold in this mountain?"
11617,Bart,"no, we need to sail!"
3428,Bart,these specials get worse every year.
11621,Bart,"sandwiches, mom. fill 'er up. and the garment bag."
3432,Bart,ewwwwww!
11624,Bart,"yeah, sure."
11637,Bart,"ow! oh, someone could get really hurt by this."
11638,Bart,stick your finger in that desk.
11639,Bart,"huh?! we're in hell?! cool! now i can look up all those people who said ""see you in hell""!"
11646,Bart,"i found a place that really wants to teach me, and i really want to learn."
3457,Bart,"hey lis, look! they're adding a new character to itchy and scratchy! ""poochie the dog?"""
3462,Bart,"mom, can we go to bed without dinner?"
3463,Bart,"don't have a cow, lis."
3464,Bart,"hey, i know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?"
3465,Bart,what? they've given you thousands of
3467,Bart,"really?! oh, how terrible!"
3469,Bart,"tough break, dad. i guess people just weren't ready for poochie. maybe in a few years."
3471,Bart,what else is on?
3472,Bart,"all right, everybody got their ticket? then get ready for today's super-barto jackpot drawing!"
11663,Bart,must be a secret government project.
3477,Bart,dad! dad! company! company!
3478,Bart,"yeah, and he collects toy robots!"
11672,Bart,you realize you're cheering the death of millions of my children.
3481,Bart,"that was a killer tour, man."
3482,Bart,"hey, dad, look what i got! zzzapp!! zzzapp! zzzapp! zzzapp!"
3483,Bart,i'unno. came outta the closet.

11677,Bart,terrible.
3487,Bart,i'unno. i kinda want a cigarette.
11678,Bart,no.
11686,Bart,maybe i am. so?
3495,Bart,da-ad --
11688,Bart,what the?
3497,Bart,"dad, i'm scared."
11690,Bart,"so if we go there with a camera to film lassen humiliating himself, i'll get revenge for him making me into this!"

12201,Bart,"what do we do, dad?"
4011,Bart,yeah. plus lots of other stuff.
4015,Bart,"so prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan's, ""paint your wagon!"""
12213,Bart,"uh ma'am, what if you're a really good person but you're in a really, really bad fight and your leg gets gangrene and it has to be amputated; will it be waiting for you in heaven?"
12214,Bart,"oh, oh, oh, me."
4025,Bart,"turn on the tv, lis."

4077,Bart,"church, cult. cult, church. so we get bored someplace else every sunday. does this really change our day-to-day lives?"
4080,Bart,these rubes in robes haven't met the likes of bart simpson before.

4103,Bart,"good, let's get to work. me and nelson will build the treehouse. martin, draw up plans for a coconut radio and, if possible, a coconut nintendo system."
12296,Bart,"hey, dad. what do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? sound like fun?"

4112,Bart,"no it's not, it's my tummy. i mean stomach. gut. crap factory."
4113,Bart,"hey, yeah! and i think i know how i can get it."
12304,Bart,"ah, baloney."
12305,Bart,"yeah, right."
12310,Bart,"oh, thanks, man. whoa, look at the size of this thing. i wonder if it really works."
12312,Bart,"sorry, dad. the answer to that is top secret."
4121,Bart,"hey, man! leave my sister alone!"
4123,Bart,"oh. gee thanks, mister."
12316,Bart,"aw, mom. can't we just grab a burger and... only four of us? who escaped?"

12332,Bart,"well, okay."
4144,Bart,"oh, this sucks. i am outta here."

4156,Bart,"hey, whoa, whoa. let's not tamper with a classic."
4160,Bart,"thank you. thank you. and now, the all new comedy stylings of... krrrusty the clown..."
4161,Bart,"krusty, the acoustics in here are..."
12353,Bart,what can i say? i got a weakness for the classics.
12361,Bart,i know i'm going and you're not.
12364,Bart,"hey, man, watch it."
12365,Bart,"hey, man, it's me, bart simpson."
12366,Bart,hey!

4182,Bart,"relax, lis. dad and i always have a plan b."
4186,Bart,"lisa insulted us, mom. she thinks she's so great. i'll dance on her grave."
12378,Bart,sorry.
4204,Bart,firecrackers. stinkbombs. maps to teachers' homes.
12397,Bart,aye carumba!
12399,Bart,are you kidding? he's my idol. i've based my whole life on krusty's teachings.
4208,Bart,a what? with who?
12402,Bart,"thanks, krusty."
12405,Bart,and his feet... they're so small.
12406,Bart,"say it ain't so, krusty."
4218,Bart,"hey, wait! i, i didn't agree to..."
12416,Bart,"come on, lisa. i think i can prove krusty's innocent, but i need your help."
4225,Bart,i'm going.
4227,Bart,"quick, ralph. in the bushes."
12420,Bart,so? i don't have a pacemaker.
4230,Bart,"right, leprechaun."
4231,Bart,"maybe later. come on, ralph -- your dad's a cop. there must be some cool stuff around here. bullets, dead body photos, what have you."
12424,Bart,"sideshow bob, can we ask you a few--"
4236,Bart,we better hide.
12430,Bart,"well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the kwik-e-mart. but krusty couldn't go near the thing. not with his pacemaker."
4239,Bart,what's that weird key for?
4242,Bart,so long -- i'm gonna sleep over at ralph's.
4243,Bart,"ohh, i found something all right."
4246,Bart,"ahh, to be eight again..."
4247,Bart,and an entire pan of funeral fudge.
4248,Bart,"uh, i'll take it from here, ralph. umm, we're just hangin', chillin'... little bit of illin'."
12438,Bart,"take him away, boys."
4250,Bart,really? you think so? i don't know what to say. this is all happening so fast.
4253,Bart,"c'mon, ralph. don't embarrass me. it's just an abandoned prison. all the murderers are long dead... and i'm sure their ghosts are probably in hell."
12447,Bart,how 'bout some grub?
4261,Bart,wow! look at all these toilets. and just inches from your bed. talk about luxury.
12458,Bart,"awww, that's merely suggested viewing matter, lady. mom lets us watch whatever the hell we want."
4267,Bart,till death do you part...
4268,Bart,"uh-oh, let's get out of here."
4269,Bart,got any threes?
4270,Bart,"oh. see, here's the problem, ralph. you have several threes."
4271,Bart,why don't we watch cartoons? the justice league is moving into their new building today.
12459,Bart,"oh, man, i can't take it anymore."
12465,Bart,run for it!
12467,Bart,the thing is no one was hurt. i think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
12468,Bart,"we know who you are, ms. botz. or should i say, ms. botzucowski. you're the babysitter bandit."
12478,Bart,"so in conclusion, on the simpsons' scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, i give this book... a nine."
12480,Bart,no? then i'll just sit down.
12487,Bart,"yes, ma'am."
4298,Bart,weapons-grade plutonium?
12490,Bart,ooo... granny killing me!
4301,Bart,cool!
12493,Bart,what's the big idea? you covered up my paper.
4304,Bart,"ready, milhouse?"
4306,Bart,"hi, willie."
12499,Bart,"hey, otto-man. i've got a big test that i am not ready for. could you please crash the bus or something?"
12502,Bart,say... who's up for a little cram session? i'll go first. what was the name of the pilgrim's boat?
4322,Bart,"i'll show lisa who's dumb. ""supreme court reverses..."" i won't turn to the comics, i won't turn to the comics."
4323,Bart,"all right, i'll read one comic just to get me rollin'. ""archie."" ""hey, jughead, didja hear, the supreme court reversed..."""
4329,Bart,some say the ducks went to canada. others say toronto. and some people think that joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. but it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
4332,Bart,"our forgotten veterans. their guns are quiet now. their helmets lost, or pawned. and yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the american flag doesn't contain the word, ""jordache."" but you know, if they run this up the flagpole, i'll salute. i'm bart simpson."
4333,Bart,i just think our veterans deserve a little recognition.
12526,Bart,"otto, you know i respect you. i mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns..."
4335,Bart,"oh, lisa, maybe you're right. maybe you're wrong. the important thing is veterans deserve a day to honor them."
12529,Bart,"look, lady. i got a peptic ulcer, a wife hocking me for a new car, and i need a root canal. will you quit bugging me about this stupid pirate."

7565,Bart,i submit! i submit!
7569,Bart,ay carumba.
7571,Bart,"you'll pay for this, my queen."
7584,Bart,"well, i'm only here because i got blamed for a prank i didn't do."
7597,Bart,"okay, i'll pick a religion for me. judaism."
7598,Bart,don't have... a cow man / don't have... a cow man / don't have... a cow man / have a piece of fish! oy!
7599,Bart,"mom, a religion isn't cool just because they've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties."
7600,Bart,"you just don't get it. i've made a sacred commitment to the catholic church, and... paintball! awesome!"
7604,Bart,i want to see santa. he can explain why he gave me a playstation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
7619,Bart,a stamp museum?
7622,Bart,again!
7627,Bart,"yeah, and i could really use your help."
7636,Bart,"hey mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?"
7644,Bart,"and i always got the spillover. drive-in movies, two christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!"
7652,Bart,this bra is really gonna lift and separate: lift your mother's suspicions and separate your parents!
7659,Bart,uh... you know that bra that broke up our family?
7661,Bart,what?! how do you know about things like that?
7668,Bart,how many times do i have to tell you: no rodgers and hammerstein!
7673,Bart,"now, i'll get my mom and dad's attention, and you shove the dummy in the water. any questions?"
7674,Bart,pile of dog doo. let's roll.
7677,Bart,this is all my fault! i planted mom's bra in milhouse's parents' bed!
7680,Bart,"no, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards."
7681,Bart,cowa--
7688,Bart,"we're still going to the toy store, right? and i can pick out as many toys as i want?"
7695,Bart,i'm ho-me!
7698,Bart,but what will junkies do drugs under?
7701,Bart,"mom, please. i'm playing a video game."
7706,Bart,"mom, i mean it. i wanna ride with you."
7711,Bart,rock climbing wall?
7713,Bart,zumanity by cirque de soleil?
7722,Bart,"me too, mother."
7723,Bart,what'd it say?
7728,Bart,i can't wait to use our new krusty the clown tea service!
7730,Bart,uh... because i'm gonna bring it back to the store for store credit.
7739,Bart,"hey, mom."
7765,Bart,what's with the canadian flag on your backpack?
7767,Bart,why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
7772,Bart,"yeah, this is italy -- look, the town drunk is two years old."
7805,Bart,"yeah, that'll be way more fun than vegas."
7809,Bart,well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i'm good at.
7817,Bart,i've learned so much in my three hours here. i don't have to play pranks to feel good. i can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
7818,Bart,dad?
7829,Bart,kid power!
7841,Bart,"that was two firemen, a crane and snow white."
7844,Bart,because i'm a screw-up. my sister's the smart one -- all i do is get in trouble.
7846,Bart,"oh, that load of crap? no, i was just keepin' her busy while nelson stole microscopes. make with the story."
7851,Bart,and... joust!
7854,Bart,"hey, you know where the bathroom is?"
7869,Bart,then itchy used an ice cream scoop to scoop out scratchy's heart and make it a sundae. the end.
7872,Bart,"hell, yeah!"
7873,Bart,luxury? this thermostat is just painted on.
7875,Bart,"dad, i've gotta write a report on the great lakes."
7877,Bart,i think he's in the house!
7881,Bart,i've got my toy wood lump!
7883,Bart,"well, i'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying."
7886,Bart,hey!
7889,Bart,he's out there playin' basketball!
7892,Bart,"oh, there it is."
7894,Bart,"dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us."
7895,Bart,"don't worry, mom. they all passed by."
7901,Bart,you have toilet paper on your shoe.
7903,Bart,toilet.
7918,Bart,"duh! nobody wants their address painted on the curb. we do it without asking, and then they have to pay."
7924,Bart,oh it's great. like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
7934,Bart,appear in summer stock play...
7942,Bart,weaving?!
7943,Bart,"homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!"
7953,Bart,"nah, i know enough."
7957,Bart,wow. i've got this sudden urge to give her a five dollar bill.
7961,Bart,"don't worry, dude. we'll hook you up with some tunes."
7971,Bart,it fell off a truck-truck truck.
7972,Bart,i don't know.
7973,Bart,"dad, you want i should plug him in the ankle?"
7979,Bart,"sorry, white stripes. no hard feelings?"
7981,Bart,absolutely not.
7982,Bart,okay... if you give me your omelet.
8008,Bart,"yeah, hasn't been the same since they murdered the mayor's dad here."
8009,Bart,"these games are so old. who got these high scores? pilgrims? hmm, never saw this one before."
8013,Bart,"a fire?! i didn't start a fire in the teachers' lounge! i mean, what fire? i mean, a letter from school? please elaborate."
8015,Bart,"why should we have to give up our salty snacks, just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?! who is this selfish jerk anyway?"
8018,Bart,hmmm.
8025,Bart,no one teaches me history!
8026,Bart,shrimp?!
8031,Bart,grampa?
8037,Bart,come to my house at midnight.
8039,Bart,"now, there's something i've wanted to do for a long time."
8040,Bart,"can't you read my writing? i didn't say kick homer's ""walls""."
8042,Bart,"i don't think so. in fact, why don't you give me your lunch money?"
8043,Bart,"no, my go-- yes, him."
8053,Bart,oh shoe-boy? i'm looking for something in a cross-trainer.
8057,Bart,"great news, ma! i agreed to join the army when i turn eighteen!"
8064,Bart,"hey guys, didja hear? ""the da vinci code"" just sold one hundred million copies!"
8072,Bart,there's mom!
8073,Bart,"it's not coffee, it's hot pepsi!"
8080,Bart,hey!
8081,Bart,"mom, i can't go -- no one else is!"
8083,Bart,"dad, don't make me go! i'll give you a back rub!"
8086,Bart,"this party doesn't suck. pizza, that's a nice touch."
8089,Bart,nelson... nobody's coming.
8096,Bart,"look, um, i don't have time for new friends. i got a lot on my plate. i've got a big report due on the nile river: topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... it's nuts."
8099,Bart,man... i never knew you were so deep.
8100,Bart,a nelson vest!
8103,Bart,life was perfect.
8105,Bart,"hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. it's offensive."
8106,Bart,"they just can, okay."
8109,Bart,"all right, i will."
8111,Bart,we were just having fun. don't get upset.
8125,Bart,aaagh! man lips!
8130,Bart,"nelson, i'll never forget that week we were best friends."
8132,Bart,"i didn't think it would ever come, but it did!"
8139,Bart,there's a spot!
8148,Bart,neon breeze!
8152,Bart,i'm really sorry.
8154,Bart,"my story takes place in a time i call ""the past""."
8161,Bart,"hey lis, check it out! with some clever scissor work, i can make the ""lakeland butter"" indian maiden show me her boobs."
8167,Bart,really? hmmm.
8176,Bart,"shut up, shut up, shut up!"
8182,Bart,"uh... yeah, i have that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it and i took too much."
8186,Bart,"no, i'm not, but--"
8187,Bart,"look, darcy, i like you. i really do. it's just... i'm only ten years old."
65537,Marge,"i know we shouldn't feed this, but grease brings raccoons."
57357,Marge,"night vision goggles? a bathroom scale from a soviet sub? a suede briefcase-case? oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems..."
65551,Marge,"even you, caveman homer."
57360,Marge,that's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.
65553,Marge,lemme get this straight. none of you had time to take out the garbage?
57361,Marge,"homer, why are they saying you're going to fight drederick tatum?"
57362,Marge,have you lost your mind?!
65559,Marge,everyone relax. i think i've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere.
57380,Marge,we're not picking him up!
57382,Marge,i just don't think it's a good idea.
65575,Marge,"all right, i remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. i mean, i don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. with this car, we're basically saying no more babies!"
65580,Marge,"well, take a shower, 'cause we're gonna try it tonight!"
65597,Marge,"ooh, homie, you've lost weight."
65599,Marge,i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
65600,Marge,"so, you don't want another baby? how long have you felt this way?"
57408,Marge,"what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?"
57411,Marge,oh? i've lived in this town for 37 years.
65605,Marge,"homer... homer, this is the point where i really have to know what you want."
57416,Marge,it's the light pink '87 wagon.
65613,Marge,yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit grampa!
57421,Marge,i rest my case.
57426,Marge,"well, i also have a song to sing!"
57441,Marge,well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
65634,Marge,lisa!
65636,Marge,"lisa, dinnertime!"
57445,Marge,homer?!
57446,Marge,are you ready?
57449,Marge,"so, did anyone see that new woodsy allen movie?"
57454,Marge,"i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they were so insulting: ""you are a coward."" no one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
65648,Marge,put that down! we're being audited!
57459,Marge,remember? luann and chase are taking us out to hear spalding gray.
65652,Marge,well... i like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles i could mention. passover.
65653,Marge,homie? aren't you going to come in?
57463,Marge,"edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- ah!... homer! what are you doing?!"
65656,Marge,no idea. the important thing is that they did.
57465,Marge,"homer, i don't need you around me 24 hours a day. i'm a grown woman -- i can take care of myself. now, will you please just go away!"
65666,Marge,you're all bald!
57477,Marge,"well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
65670,Marge,ooo! hygiene!
57480,Marge,"ooh, a rubik's cube. let's all work it together."
57482,Marge,"oh, there's so little left: creamed eels? corn nog? wadded beef?"
65676,Marge,"geez, is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie?"
57489,Marge,"dear god, this is marge simpson. if you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. so if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
57494,Marge,"i started making some calls last night, and before i knew it, practically all of springfield was offering to help."
57495,Marge,"ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
65689,Marge,then to save us... we need something incredibly unnatural!
57498,Marge,"homer, i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
57499,Marge,"well, don't look at me... just because i'm holding a pair of scissors. scissors which i need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
65694,Marge,you know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!
65699,Marge,we don't want a raccoon.
65703,Marge,oh homie. i'm so sorry.
65709,Marge,"keep an eye on the kids, homer."
65712,Marge,"until then, why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences."
57520,Marge,yeah.
65716,Marge,what move? we haven't moved! what's going on?!
57525,Marge,space coyote?
57526,Marge,we'll all be killed!
57527,Marge,we did it!
65721,Marge,i'm going to bed.
57529,Marge,bad cat!
65731,Marge,everything's normal. the world didn't end.
65732,Marge,"are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
57549,Marge,...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
57553,Marge,now you're the one who's being naive.
65748,Marge,i guess you do know your weather.
65752,Marge,it's like god's vacuum cleaner!
57562,Marge,i'll take it!
65755,Marge,are you pushing?
57564,Marge,don't forget fat people. they can't stop eating!
57566,Marge,welcome to pretzel wagon. may i take your order?
57568,Marge,excuse me. i had this spot first.
65761,Marge,"no, our state."
65762,Marge,there's really only one choice. or should i say two identical choices?
65763,Marge,"homer, my sisters adopted ling and she's doing great."
57569,Marge,"well, i guess macy's and gimbel's learned to live side by side."
57574,Marge,here you go -- free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone! one bite and you'll be hooked!
65768,Marge,i think i hear a slight accent.
65775,Marge,but we know so little about them.
57584,Marge,"oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn."
57591,Marge,we're going to do what we do every day. we're going to make pretzels.
57592,Marge,"there, that's the last one."
57595,Marge,"oh, i don't hate you for failing. i love you for trying."
57603,Marge,there they are! let me down here.
65796,Marge,"all right. fine. if you boys want it, i'll tell you what i really think."
65799,Marge,you are invited to... a grand gesture? oooh!
57607,Marge,"oh, all right, all right, i'll get your milk!"
57610,Marge,what kind of hair?
57613,Marge,"homie, i'm losing my hair."
57622,Marge,that's carl.
65818,Marge,mm-hmm!
65819,Marge,i don't think so. the u.s. embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield.
57626,Marge,no.
57627,Marge,"shary bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
57633,Marge,thank you for everything.
57634,Marge,"shary, you did the best you could. but you can't change this family. neither can i. from now on i'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the ride."
65829,Marge,do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldn't take her to?
65831,Marge,the kids?
65834,Marge,i want to know what it's for.
57643,Marge,i need to purchase a brassiere. you kids wait over here in the credit department.
65839,Marge,i think your dad might be gay.
65840,Marge,i think this is great! old gay men are adorable! like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
65841,Marge,"your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year."
57651,Marge,so?
57653,Marge,"well, i never thought it would come to this, but i guess we'll have to sell grandma's civil war doll."
57658,Marge,"oh, no. oh, no, no, no, no. no. it's a very, very old figurine."
57667,Marge,... sexual.
57672,Marge,come on. you liked john this morning.
65871,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie? is a book character having difficulties?"
57680,Marge,"oh, homer, please. you're embarrassing yourself."
57681,Marge,"what? you never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
57683,Marge,"just remember, bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" they're bad people."
57686,Marge,"oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
65880,Marge,objection! unhealthy!
65882,Marge,what's odd?
57693,Marge,you can't ask god to kill someone!
65892,Marge,"when god rested on the seventh day, did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed?"
57700,Marge,"well, we have to run. i'm sure you kids will work things out. good night!"
57709,Marge,"young lady, you will never babysit again! i am so disappointed -ointed... - ointed... -ointed..."
65904,Marge,"well, that does sound good..."
57712,Marge,"parades just bring out so many emotions in me: joy, excitement, looking..."
57716,Marge,"what happened to you, homer? and what have you done to the car?"
57718,Marge,that's funny... i used to be able to go down there.
57724,Marge,whooh...
65922,Marge,ohhh.
57730,Marge,krabappel?
57732,Marge,"homer, bart's up there!"
57742,Marge,"""some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
65937,Marge,"homer's pie man costume, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, lisa's red dress, sunday-best bart..."
57746,Marge,"besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with bart."
57747,Marge,"oh, maggie, you got oatmeal all over. homer, would you clean her off?"
65940,Marge,a high-voltage monkey prod? it is krusty's! he must have my dress. let's go!
65944,Marge,homer! you're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!
65949,Marge,how?
57758,Marge,"lisa, nobody likes a gloater. right, homie?"
65955,Marge,"fine. i'm getting rid of this american masters ""kitty carlisle."""
57763,Marge,"homer, the lord only asks for an hour a week."
57770,Marge,well... okay. i will volunteer!
65963,Marge,maybe i should come too.
57771,Marge,"all done! i swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
65965,Marge,"bart, you're in charge of grampa."
57774,Marge,but you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
65970,Marge,"oh moe, this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes!"
57778,Marge,"okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
57781,Marge,"well, i think volunteering is great. deep down it makes you feel --"
57783,Marge,that's ridiculous. nobody is watching us right now.
57786,Marge,"please, one at a time, one at a time! now, who has the most urgent problem?"
65980,Marge,let me guess... you need a field trip mom?
65981,Marge,a library volunteer? someone to purell the cpr dummy?
57789,Marge,"we all need a little time to ourselves, helen. just give him a day or two and i'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
57792,Marge,"well, ned, you don't have to stand for that. you just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
57795,Marge,"oh, all right, let me talk to them. put me on with the lead boy."
65988,Marge,"let's go, bart..."
65991,Marge,there might be some nagging involved.
65994,Marge,lesson over.
57809,Marge,thank heavens!
57813,Marge,"hmmm... ""nitzi""..."
57822,Marge,"well, maybe... but i'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
57824,Marge,"i wouldn't bother him, honey. he's making some kind of model for a contest. he says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
66019,Marge,wrong. you have to walk all the way over to grampa to take a plate of cookies i baked.
57827,Marge,ghost? what ghost?
66023,Marge,"thank you, god."
57834,Marge,"in a minute, homie. i have to get the door."
66030,Marge,"i still can't believe it was carl who took your winnings. i thought it would have been you, or you, or you."
57840,Marge,at least think of our dentist bills!
57842,Marge,"he's just kidding. we'd like to thank fox, and the good people at budget lodge."
57845,Marge,"now, about your punishment, young man."
57847,Marge,no! no drugs. bart just needs a little discipline.
57848,Marge,"you know, maybe chief wiggum is right. military school is a good idea."
66044,Marge,"homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!"
57853,Marge,"oh, honey... i heard you the first time."
66046,Marge,"oooohhh, i'm going to hell!"
66047,Marge,"okay, i've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!"
57857,Marge,"homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
66061,Marge,one of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...
57869,Marge,"i'm so glad we took the subway. ""laser wart removal"". wow, the future is here!"
57870,Marge,are we still in little italy?
66064,Marge,"i am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
57874,Marge,if only i didn't already have a pair of shoes.
66068,Marge,what? now? why?
57877,Marge,you better start saving now. it's very expensive.
57879,Marge,"we're not jumping, homer."
66072,Marge,"gee, i thought you'd be some kind of creep. but you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--"
66074,Marge,i know a place where no one in town will see us.
66085,Marge,hello! it's moe from moe's tavern.
57896,Marge,movies john travolta made...
57897,Marge,those were the days.
66091,Marge,can you follow everything okay?
66093,Marge,the dowager grandmum!
57904,Marge,hi honey! how was your first day of school? honey?
57906,Marge,"homer, i can't get the baby to burp. could you try for a while?"
66099,Marge,that'll take hours! on our anniversary!
66104,Marge,i said no!
57915,Marge,"with nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
66108,Marge,oh my god. our train! homie you do care. you care a lot!
57922,Marge,"yeeesss. well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
66116,Marge,"no! no, that's bart's cereal!"
57927,Marge,i cannot believe this. i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
57930,Marge,"please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help lisa."
66124,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
66125,Marge,why didn't you call us?
66126,Marge,"well, what made you--"
57935,Marge,"you know, homer... i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?"
66130,Marge,amen.
57939,Marge,"that sounds beautiful, ned. and let me just say, my family and i share your vision for a better now!"
66132,Marge,i've been having snuggle dreams!
66133,Marge,"oh my, what's that thing you're doing?"
57940,Marge,"friends with mutants, right."
57944,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
57945,Marge,"ohh, you want more syrup, honey?"
66140,Marge,"now, i'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. it's a catwoman costume i'm sure is unique."
57948,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
66142,Marge,just one m & m.
57950,Marge,"let's come to our senses, everyone. this witch hunt is turning into a circus."
57952,Marge,what?!
66145,Marge,"with the mighty tongue god's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?"
57954,Marge,"no, that was gophers."
66151,Marge,awww...
57959,Marge,his name is homer.
57960,Marge,we're here to eat your kids.
66155,Marge,i said go!
66162,Marge,"well, for some reason it relaxes me. now do that thing gene simmons does."
57971,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. no weapons."
57972,Marge,"homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts."
57973,Marge,does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
66166,Marge,"anything from ""love gun""!"
57975,Marge,it's the same table!
57976,Marge,"homer, i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage."
57977,Marge,"but this is the first time since we've been married that i've actually feared for our lives. so i'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun."
66170,Marge,really?
66172,Marge,"you know what i think about regrets? as long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one."
57981,Marge,"how could you?! of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable..."
66174,Marge,did you eat a peanut?
66178,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is."
66179,Marge,"you've had the same job, same car, same house for twenty years. and that's all you'll ever have. a cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change. and you're okay with it!"
66180,Marge,like i say night after night after night: nighty-night.
57993,Marge,"oh, homie."
57994,Marge,"c'mon, kids. we're goin' home."
66188,Marge,that's even worse. could you say it one more time?
57997,Marge,"now make no mistake. when i say ""first aid,"" i'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert!"
58001,Marge,i was thinking more like protection for... down there.
58006,Marge,he's the only coach this team has ever had. and the season hasn't even started yet.
66202,Marge,fine. you can have your old one!
58015,Marge,he's doing what he thinks is best...
58017,Marge,"wow, homer coaching in the championship game. you must be pretty proud of your son."
66212,Marge,coming through! wife on a mission!
66213,Marge,"wow, i've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick!"
58023,Marge,what?!
66218,Marge,so this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
58026,Marge,ohhhh. here i am!
66220,Marge,i'm a schwarzenegger wife.
66221,Marge,it's not good! none of it's good!
66223,Marge,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
66227,Marge,late night at moe's eh?
66232,Marge,"oh, for god's sake."
58043,Marge,"my poor lisa. if you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... i feel sorry for you."
66236,Marge,lisa? is everything okay?
66238,Marge,"they are, huh?"
66239,Marge,"i thought i'd show you this when you were older, but..."
58048,Marge,"well, i guess you were right, honey. but you have to admit, when that angel started to talk, you were squeezing my hand pretty hard."
58051,Marge,is this all we're going to do today?
66244,Marge,"have a great day, kids. and bart, i'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons."
66247,Marge,"well, that's sort of what i was trying to say. but..."
58056,Marge,ooo... oo! there's an azalea festival at the public garden!
66258,Marge,"well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't. our house is very odd that way."
58071,Marge,easement!
58077,Marge,there it is!
58078,Marge,"i thought so too, but they said it sells."
58080,Marge,no.
66275,Marge,the pudding will be jell-o.
66278,Marge,we wish you a merry christmas / and a happy new year!
58088,Marge,but... all i did was tell the truth.
66282,Marge,"ooo, date night! i'll go change my bra!"
66283,Marge,we'll call that nice girl who's getting her masters in child development.
66287,Marge,"when i watched that pirated movie, i was stealing with my eyes. so i'm repaying the good people in hollywood for the ticket i should have bought."
66288,Marge,now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
58100,Marge,"some people would call it ""cozy."""
66293,Marge,your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
58102,Marge,"well, that about does it for houses in this area..."
58106,Marge,but it was!
66299,Marge,"i didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
66301,Marge,but the movie isn't in theaters till next week.
58109,Marge,hello? anyone home?
58113,Marge,"i'm glad you're not mad, but i lied to you! and i won't feel right until i return your deposit."
58117,Marge,why do you always wait until christmas eve to do your shopping? the crowds are just beastly.
66315,Marge,"now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
58123,Marge,for once we're gonna celebrate christmas as a family.
66322,Marge,are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
66324,Marge,i heard that!
66330,Marge,maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
66334,Marge,such a good baby! you deserve some ice cream.
58143,Marge,"also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
66338,Marge,"i hate when i come here and the first word out of my mouth is homer. but here we go. again. homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
66341,Marge,"hello, homie! dinner's almost ready! pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
58149,Marge,but mr. trebek --
66344,Marge,"oh i forgot to tell you, homie! i bumped into helen lovejoy today, and guess what?"
66348,Marge,that's it. that was the story.
58158,Marge,"we got the popcorn! did you get ""waiting to exhale?"""
66351,Marge,don't take too long!
58161,Marge,i thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
66354,Marge,i don't have any diamonds.
66358,Marge,where could bart be?
58166,Marge,it's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children!
58169,Marge,"okay, who wants dinner?"
58170,Marge,"well, let's get eatin'."
66365,Marge,"bake sale -- taken... candle snuffing -- taken... baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support -- everything's taken! all that's left is..."
58173,Marge,i'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
66367,Marge,"look, i'm really not comfortable talking about s-e-x with k-i-d-s."
66368,Marge,"hello. hello. i'm-i'm marge simpson. and i'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
66371,Marge,that was a sexual harassment seminar!
66375,Marge,i am so tired of those kids sniggering.
66380,Marge,well then maybe i need to give those kids a better example. goodnight!
66383,Marge,"i brought homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
66384,Marge,we're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!
58194,Marge,how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
66388,Marge,"grampa, what happened?"
66390,Marge,when are your relatives going to be here?
58201,Marge,that was fun. i wish we had a glass bottom car. i can't help but wonder what we're missing.
58207,Marge,homer!!
66402,Marge,"actually, homer got up early to count and sort pills. then he called the police when a frisbee landed on our lawn. then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel."
66403,Marge,i didn't mind that he grew bald... i didn't mind that he got fat... i didn't mind that he got fatter. but no one told me he'd get older than me.
66405,Marge,"ooh, what's your hurry?"
58215,Marge,homer...
66409,Marge,"well, we've talked about it, and if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract."
58219,Marge,you what?!
66412,Marge,lisa! you've just gotta choose one. lisa!?
58222,Marge,"i can't go along with this, homer."
66425,Marge,all our friends are like that!
66428,Marge,sure.
66431,Marge,"if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? we were just trying to be... kind."
66434,Marge,an atm receipt?
66440,Marge,you really think we're still doing the right thing?
66445,Marge,"homie, there's someone here to see you."
66454,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, wait! i wanna say something!"
58264,Marge,"ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt."
66457,Marge,"first, mazel tov! second, don't! please, please, i'm a mother. surely you have a mother too."
66459,Marge,i'll come back with the fire truck. i just have to get the kids to school first.
66461,Marge,no! you didn't hear anything!
58269,Marge,they have those. they're government listings.
58271,Marge,four drink minimum?
66467,Marge,"right, right, right, right. according to judy kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
58278,Marge,why all the black?
66472,Marge,"homie, i love you. but you can be a challenge, like doing the daily jumble."
58283,Marge,"um, you're just having a bad day. i had one last week. i burned the roast, my cake fell, and i ran out of butter so i had to spray the english muffins with pam."
58284,Marge,i'll go get the bactine.
66477,Marge,"homie, i don't have a problem with you. except your buttons are off one.... actually, this is a collar button... see? it goes like this..."
66478,Marge,"homer, could you come with me for a minute?"
58286,Marge,lisa! come on! your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
58287,Marge,bart!
66484,Marge,"oh, of course. you're right, honey. i'll just um, i'll park it at the bar."
58294,Marge,"wait a minute, homer! you didn't ask everybody. what about the women?"
66489,Marge,"thank you, moe."
66498,Marge,nothing for thirty years. you're perfect for each other.
58307,Marge,"all right, all right, now. you're over-stimulated. let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed."
66501,Marge,phoo! you two don't know what a rough marriage is.
58309,Marge,that ralph wiggum boy. he's a real winner.
66504,Marge,"after thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right."
58313,Marge,"now, why don't you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? you two make an adorable pair."
66508,Marge,"homie, i can't find my spatula! can you get another one?"
58319,Marge,"nnno, that stinks. let me try one."
66513,Marge,marge simpson. congratulations on little king george.
58322,Marge,"homie, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. what if you get called into combat?"
58327,Marge,what on earth possessed you to get an earring?
58328,Marge,if milhouse jumped off a cliff--
66521,Marge,okay with no friends. that's the saddest thing i can imagine my daughter saying to me.
66526,Marge,and stay in the living room. don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
66529,Marge,"you were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you."
66530,Marge,homer!
66531,Marge,i'd like to be alone for a while.
66532,Marge,yes.
58343,Marge,"honey, i'd love to reassure you, but right now mommy needs a tetanus shot."
66546,Marge,pizza. mmmm.
58356,Marge,"it's a ""kisses-make-me-boogie-o-lantern."""
66549,Marge,"lisa. lisa, wait..."
66553,Marge,"lisa, just say something to me."
66558,Marge,that's a prison road crew.
58368,Marge,you've signed my name lots of times.
58369,Marge,"i'm really proud of you, homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?"
66562,Marge,maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
58370,Marge,who can take this diaper?
58372,Marge,"i'll have to say drugs, too."
66568,Marge,but you wear that little spoon around your neck.
58381,Marge,"okay, honey. okay. i'll start taking in all your slacks."
66575,Marge,"/ no good, no good. what do i do? what do i do?"
58386,Marge,"homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. food. i mean, food."
58390,Marge,"oh, homie! you're alive!"
58397,Marge,we've got to get you to a doctor right away.
66590,Marge,yikes!
58405,Marge,but--
58407,Marge,"lisa, we're home! sorry about the museum! you'd better go up and apologize."
66601,Marge,"...so, i cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
58413,Marge,what happened to grampa? he was supposed to baby-sit.
58415,Marge,"well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic."
66610,Marge,all you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
66611,Marge,my store. my offset spatula! mine!
58418,Marge,i'm going to bed.
66615,Marge,i'm not sure this is going to work out.
66616,Marge,no lawsuit! you're hired!
66617,Marge,"well, what do you want a job for?"
58425,Marge,ooh! ooh! ooh! ooh! sorry! sorry! sorry! do you want me to?
58426,Marge,"well, we used to..."
58427,Marge,ooh! who's a good boy?
66628,Marge,what am i going to do? i'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
58439,Marge,ohhh. my hero.
66632,Marge,"i was short-staffed and your father volunteered. actually, i was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand."
58440,Marge,"well, let's just say the country air did us good."
58442,Marge,"oh, isn't it romantic? doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see."
66637,Marge,take 'em!
58446,Marge,"what's wrong with us, homer? have we lost the spark already?"
66642,Marge,how could they open another franchise so close to me?
66644,Marge,there is no drive thru!
58454,Marge,"oh, we drank so much that night."
58459,Marge,we've gotta get home before someone sees us.
58461,Marge,got 'em.
66654,Marge,"if you'll just give me back my original investment, i'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries."
66658,Marge,"well, i guess we could try it for a semester."
66659,Marge,dum got a job at the tower of london... as a beefeater!
58468,Marge,"oh, it would have to be camera day."
58471,Marge,so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
58474,Marge,all you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? don't you need a notebook or something?
66667,Marge,those are in the kitchen!
58477,Marge,"i'm sure they didn't ""ditch"" you, honey. maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you."
58482,Marge,"ohh, so you don't have a date. you can still go and have a wonderful time."
66681,Marge,but our water was on fire.
58499,Marge,homer! you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
66694,Marge,"okay, head count. one, two, three, where's maggie?!"
66695,Marge,yes it does!
66696,Marge,can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
58509,Marge,"oh, dear. i hope i wasn't too rough on him."
58515,Marge,"hey, listen to this!"
58521,Marge,slow and steady wins the race.
58532,Marge,"he didn't go to nelson's, did he?"
66725,Marge,what the?
58535,Marge,"young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
66731,Marge,"oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. what if -- all the dads jammed together... in a dad band?!"
58545,Marge,"i don't know, and i don't want to know. and i'm going to find out!"
66738,Marge,"stop feeling sorry for yourself. your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent."
66739,Marge,see you soon!
58547,Marge,"bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here."
66741,Marge,wish homer was here.
58548,Marge,"oh, i'll come back later."
58554,Marge,hmm... it's starting to cool down. i'll bake another pie.
66748,Marge,why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
58556,Marge,i see a foot!
58561,Marge,not as hard as you think.
66757,Marge,"abe simpson, please."
58570,Marge,"sorry, but if i let you watch one of these gruesome halloween cartoons, i'd be a pretty lousy mother."
66764,Marge,"homie, i'm your present tonight. and the present is that i'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. because i realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining."
58575,Marge,"aww, somebody's in love."
58576,Marge,that means you'll have to be neutered.
66769,Marge,i don't like the end sounds on that.
66772,Marge,aww.
66777,Marge,what?!
58589,Marge,really? that seemed awfully quick.
58591,Marge,"nine months later, i gave birth to maggie."
58592,Marge,i am so -ing embarrassed.
58596,Marge,"yes, we'll go to the darn lake! now go back to bed. it's four a.m.!"
66796,Marge,homer... you're not going to school.
58605,Marge,it won't go any --
66800,Marge,they've run away!
66805,Marge,"homie, i've missed you!"
58613,Marge,"well, it's better than that last barbra streisand movie."
58615,Marge,you lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
66814,Marge,what's wrong homer? is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
58622,Marge,we all blame you.
66817,Marge,"goodbye, elon. our town will never forgive you!"
58625,Marge,"ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?"
66820,Marge,"homer, it's a standing ovation, get up!"
58629,Marge,i feel guilty coming here every sunday and never actually buying anything.
58630,Marge,"oh my goodness! homer, get her out of there!"
66825,Marge,you don't have to do this alone.
58635,Marge,"ohh, how are you feeling, sweetie?"
58636,Marge,"oh my, you're burning up. i'm going to tell the school you're staying home."
58644,Marge,with eight years of scrupulous honesty.
58646,Marge,"ooh, so plump and juicy. he's gonna boil up nicely."
58649,Marge,let's go! in the pot. in the pot.
66845,Marge,looks like this is all me.
66849,Marge,so you're a taxi?
66850,Marge,"well, i drive all day and i don't get paid a thing. with the money you make, i could buy a fridge with... an icemaker."
58659,Marge,and 40 percent more rootin' tootin'!
66852,Marge,yes.
58660,Marge,"it's so sweet of you to take us out like this, homie. come on, kids, three cheers for your father! hip hip--"
66856,Marge,"i'm... i'm sorry, but i'm not your mother."
58664,Marge,i never realized history was so filthy.
66859,Marge,no!
66861,Marge,i didn't mean to use that word! it's okay to have a feminine side. it's good in fact!
58671,Marge,homer!
66870,Marge,i hope no one was hurt.
66872,Marge,apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
66874,Marge,not even homer?
66876,Marge,"well, to raise money, we're... putting on a revue."
58690,Marge,"you know, i really don't care for that code name."
66888,Marge,"i'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. but until then, i appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
66891,Marge,homie. how did you end up at the casino?
66894,Marge,"god's plan?! god isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! god isn't sky police. god didn't do this. i lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! we did this."
58705,Marge,"you mean, you've never splurged and, say, eaten an entire birthday cake, then blamed it on the dog?"
66901,Marge,but we don't need to come back. we saved the church.
66902,Marge,"homie, after all this, do you still believe in god?"
66903,Marge,"ooo, careful, homer."
58709,Marge,but there's only been one pitch!
58710,Marge,"no, of course not!"
66913,Marge,"a pony? oh, lisa. you've asked for that for the last three years and i keep telling you santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. can't you take a hint?"
58721,Marge,"oh, the hippo's missing..."
58723,Marge,"oh, homer..."
58725,Marge,"yeah, we're scared!"
66918,Marge,homer?
58730,Marge,i'm so happy you're going to the big game. my dream has always been to see the bolshoi ballet.
58731,Marge,it's so nice to have a peaceful weekend together.
58732,Marge,"mm-hm. hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits aunt patty always gives us?"
58738,Marge,right. na--
66932,Marge,yes...
58741,Marge,let's call the company.
66935,Marge,"but homer, my sisters are here. don't you want to say hello?"
66936,Marge,he said he went caroling with bart.
66937,Marge,maybe i should call the police.
58743,Marge,it's vincent price! i thought he was dead.
58745,Marge,"742 evergreen terrace, springfield. oh, hiya, maude! come on in."
58746,Marge,locked.
58749,Marge,another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
66942,Marge,"take it, homer!"
66943,Marge,"oh, homer."
58750,Marge,no he's not.
58754,Marge,"homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. why don't you talk to the producers of the show? maybe they'll make your character suave again."
58756,Marge,you changed your name without consulting me?
58759,Marge,"but i fell in love with homer simpson. i don't want to snuggle with ""max power."""
58760,Marge,"oh, lord."
66960,Marge,"bart, stop fooling around. homer, stop encouraging him."
58768,Marge,"and there's ed begley, jr."
66962,Marge,shhh!
66966,Marge,"oh, well."
58774,Marge,you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
58775,Marge,swab? i thought it was a spray.
66974,Marge,"oh, homer, how could you think of killing yourself? we love you."
66975,Marge,"don't be nervous. we believe in you, homer."
58785,Marge,"sweet dreams, honey."
66979,Marge,you don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
58792,Marge,"well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
58793,Marge,annnd... now.
66986,Marge,"uh-huh. well, uh... i sense greatness in my family."
58795,Marge,what a lovely home!
66990,Marge,he's here at last my one and only. good-bye friends and don't be lonely.
66992,Marge,"well, i'm not much of a drinker..."
66995,Marge,"homie, get in the car."
58804,Marge,maybe we should leave.
66997,Marge,"but homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the man upstairs?"
67000,Marge,they're having a conversation. they actually enjoy talking to each other.
58817,Marge,hmmm... sometimes i find pickle slices in the sheets.
58818,Marge,"oh... just once, i'd like a parrot to say that to me."
58822,Marge,"homer, i've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
67015,Marge,these are for lisa's class.
58825,Marge,"""i love you... cactus? blobby? upsilon?"" oh, who am i kidding? homer would never surprise me like that."
58829,Marge,"oh, homie. oh, they're beautiful."
58831,Marge,"no, no, as soon as i get over, that lane will stop moving. erma bombeck said so, and dave barry agrees."
67025,Marge,"bart, what happened to you?"
67030,Marge,shh! this bully friend of yours... is he a little on the chunky side?
58840,Marge,hang on. the manual says i need to log on to the onboard computer.
67034,Marge,are you boys through playing war?
67037,Marge,"i'm sorry, everybody. but i've only got two cupcakes for the three of you."
67042,Marge,"homer, wake up! wake up! oh my, here let me wipe off that drool."
67043,Marge,"well, i'm still trying to figure out what's bothering lisa. i don't know, bart's such a handful, and maggie needs attention, but all the while our little lisa's becoming a young woman."
67044,Marge,"good night, homer."
67045,Marge,"lisa, get away from that jazzman!"
67054,Marge,"lisa, you'll be late for band practice. let's go."
67059,Marge,"lisa, i apologize to you. i was wrong. i take it all back. always be yourself. you want to be sad, honey, be sad. we'll ride it out with you. and when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. from now on, let me do the smiling for both of us."
67060,Marge,"i said you could stop smiling, lisa."
67061,Marge,"boys, i'd like your attention, please."
58875,Marge,"c'mon, homer! jump!"
67071,Marge,"homer, i'm telling you this is not the interstate."
58879,Marge,stone philips again!
58880,Marge,but there's only one way to find out!
58881,Marge,"wake up, homer."
67075,Marge,"oh, homer. what are we going to do?"
58885,Marge,you agreed to spend one saturday a month doing something with the kids.
67080,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
58890,Marge,it's just until we pay off daddy's desecration of a priceless artifact. i thought i'd never have to say that again.
58891,Marge,maggie?!
67092,Marge,"oh homer, you promised me..."
67096,Marge,"can you believe this, homer? ... homer? ... homer?"
58904,Marge,that was a horrible trick to play on your mother!
58905,Marge,"hm. well, i guess we both learned a lesson. but if anybody asks, you hit him."
58907,Marge,you still haven't told us why lenny bit you.
58910,Marge,you didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
67103,Marge,"no! look, i don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. lisa, bart, what did you two learn in sunday school today?"
67104,Marge,"no way, jose."
67105,Marge,"um mmm. i know what those movies are like. killing innocent people, eating human flesh. you just get a lot of bad ideas."
67106,Marge,"bart, are you all right?"
58911,Marge,ooh-woo. a complimentary basket of hooves.
67108,Marge,it's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town.
58914,Marge,"is it safe to eat that much food, dr. hibbert?"
67110,Marge,"why, bart, why?"
67111,Marge,where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?
58919,Marge,"good-bye, homer."
67114,Marge,"well, isn't this nice?"
67115,Marge,"no, homer. it's mine."
67117,Marge,"patty, he's out buying me something right now."
67120,Marge,the place where the waiters sing.
58933,Marge,"if your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band."
67130,Marge,"you bought that bowling ball for you, not for me."
58938,Marge,dammit!
58939,Marge,ring the bell!
67134,Marge,"homer, i'm keeping the ball. for myself."
67135,Marge,hmmm. i'll just use my ball.
67136,Marge,"i'm keeping it and i'm going to use it. thank you for the present, homer."
58942,Marge,"ohhh, it's heavenly! ""why do birds suddenly appear... over there, over here..."""
67138,Marge,thank you.
58948,Marge,oooo. what a beautiful garden. it's almost like paradise.
58952,Marge,"well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
67148,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
67152,Marge,sure.
58963,Marge,"well, it's a little late for apologies now."
58965,Marge,"oh, thank you. are you okay?"
58967,Marge,"i'm sure god will let us return soon. i mean, how long can he hold a grudge?"
58969,Marge,"oh no, it's the apocalypse. bart, are you wearing clean underwear?"
67164,Marge,twenty-five dollars!
58973,Marge,i'm serious. you never finished painting the garage.
58975,Marge,yup.
58977,Marge,"homie, someone's at the door. they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident."
67177,Marge,"good night, homer."
67179,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
58988,Marge,you don't understand.
58994,Marge,"now this is a joseph turner. in an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the venetian canals."
58996,Marge,any ideas yet?
58999,Marge,"oh, that can't be good."
59004,Marge,ohh...
67199,Marge,please.
67200,Marge,thank you.
67201,Marge,destiny?
59010,Marge,"hey, that's cute."
67203,Marge,until inevitably...
59013,Marge,"so, bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
67208,Marge,so how was the office birthday party?
59017,Marge,nothing.
59020,Marge,give me my baby!
59021,Marge,i want these springs out of our house today.
67214,Marge,eugene fisk? isn't he your assistant?
59023,Marge,i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. when was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
67217,Marge,bart.
59025,Marge,"fine. if we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. i wrote another poem about a duck."
67219,Marge,"stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the rusty barnacle."
59034,Marge,all this commotion just for a store?
59035,Marge,this is so much nicer than the kwik-e-mart.
59039,Marge,"oh, i don't think mr. burns would like that show."
59043,Marge,"lisa, would you like a penny to throw at your brother?"
59044,Marge,"young lady, this may be the high point of bart's life. cut him some slack."
67239,Marge,"oh, he's sunk even lower!"
59048,Marge,"oh, homie."
59049,Marge,"homie? well, look at you..."
67243,Marge,"oh, homer. how many times do i have to fluff your pillow?"
59052,Marge,"hold on, wha-- that's our basement?"
67245,Marge,"i know how you like 'em, homer."
59054,Marge,"no, you weren't."
67249,Marge,deportation! you mean kick bart out of the country?
67250,Marge,homer! you didn't even ask where bart would be going.
59060,Marge,"oh homer, not again."
59062,Marge,not if we want that vacation.
67257,Marge,"goodbye, my special, my special little guy. you will write us, won't you?"
67260,Marge,adil?
59070,Marge,"come on, homer, japan will be fun. you liked ""rashomon."""
59072,Marge,i never knew jim belushi made so many movies.
59073,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open."
67266,Marge,homer!
67267,Marge,you sure have taken a shine to little adil.
59074,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
67270,Marge,oh... adil's a very sweet boy.
67271,Marge,"dear bart, how is france? i don't know why you haven't written. i guess you're just having too much fun."
59081,Marge,every truck-load of fish we gut brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home.
67274,Marge,"hello, homer. what's that?"
67275,Marge,"oh, my."
59082,Marge,family wish show... hmmm... that gives me an idea.
59084,Marge,"no, no, no! we want plane tickets home to springfield."
59086,Marge,"mmm, i don't think that bridge can support much weight."
67280,Marge,"hello, homie. i was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work."
59088,Marge,"oh, i'm afraid this might be the end."
59091,Marge,"boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
67285,Marge,hmmm hmmm.
59093,Marge,"i know, but we didn't."
67287,Marge,"oh, homer."
59095,Marge,they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring mel gibson!
67289,Marge,these toys are just adorable. who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius?
59096,Marge,who cares? mel gibson!
67294,Marge,"i'm marge, thirty-four, and my problem is my husband. he doesn't listen to me. he doesn't appreciate me. i don't know how much more of this i can --"
59103,Marge,"i liked it. it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing."
59108,Marge,"hollywood, here we come!"
59109,Marge,"hollywood, here we are!"
59112,Marge,ew!
59113,Marge,eewww!!
67311,Marge,"well, tonight is a very special night. your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing."
59123,Marge,how will we get bart to take these?
67317,Marge,"'bye, now. be good. gotta go."
59126,Marge,"honey, if you don't want to take the medicine, we won't force you."
59128,Marge,it's what i do.
67322,Marge,"okay, but watch out. don't slam my head like last time."
67329,Marge,"homer, would it spoil the mood if i called home? you know, just to check on the kids?"
59143,Marge,bart? honey?
59144,Marge,o-kayyy.
59150,Marge,"... and i'm really worried, chief. there's no telling what he might do."
59154,Marge,my sweet baby. he must feel so helpless and scared.
67348,Marge,"wake up bart, rise and shine, little guy. time to wake up."
67349,Marge,wake up and look at the snow.
67350,Marge,remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
59160,Marge,"well, i'm not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. from now on it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned ritalin!"
59163,Marge,who wants pork chops?
67357,Marge,"happy anniversary, homer."
67363,Marge,homer!
67364,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so sorry."
59171,Marge,please be a dog.
59174,Marge,"oh, it was an accident! an accident!"
67368,Marge,"oh, homer, honey. come here."
59176,Marge,stop winking.
59178,Marge,no.
59179,Marge,someone saw us.
67373,Marge,it just seems too good to be true.
67377,Marge,evil!
67379,Marge,i'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
59191,Marge,you're pouring hot butter on my leg!
59194,Marge,my hero!
59199,Marge,i'm afraid so. and his wife's with him.
59203,Marge,"we're fine, colonel. good day."
67397,Marge,sorry. your game is very nice.
67399,Marge,"for a superior race, they really rub it in."
59207,Marge,"holy moly, we can't stay here. it's full of raccoons."
59210,Marge,"well, it's probably just a bad growing season."
67403,Marge,"homer, i am not sleeping with the lights on. they're just children's stories. they can't hurt you."
59212,Marge,"it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
67407,Marge,"well, frankly, i don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known."
59216,Marge,but it's only been one night.
67410,Marge,what!
67411,Marge,absolutely not!
67414,Marge,"no, i'm just fine right here."
59227,Marge,shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
67422,Marge,"homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them."
67423,Marge,"i hope you'll space out the tubs this year, homer."
59232,Marge,"num num, maggie. num num."
67428,Marge,all this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
67429,Marge,"now, homer."
59240,Marge,"now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. so we'll just stay here and not disturb him."
67433,Marge,"let's do it, homer!"
67438,Marge,"awww. come to bed, homie."
67442,Marge,i don't know.
59257,Marge,"apu, come quick! you're missing the miracle!"
59258,Marge,you have octuplets. it rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
59272,Marge,dancing!
59274,Marge,wooo!
67468,Marge,homer!
67469,Marge,"oh, my best dress."
67470,Marge,"homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters."
59277,Marge,you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
59278,Marge,"""her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."""
59283,Marge,"thank you, ramrod."
67477,Marge,"no, no, no, no, the other one."
59285,Marge,"just put it on my sewing pile. okay, i'm doing another load of bandanas!"
67481,Marge,"homer, shouldn't you go pick up grampa?"
59290,Marge,"well, good. i guess."
67483,Marge,mom! you made it! how are you!
59292,Marge,"you know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing."
67488,Marge,"yes, you do! i hope you're happy, bart! you've ruined thanksgiving!"
59298,Marge,broke! you broke your pencil.
59301,Marge,"homer, stop! no, you don't understand!"
59302,Marge,talk to him. use your words.
67495,Marge,"oh, no! my sweet little bart!"
59304,Marge,"ohh, i just swept the circle of death!"
59306,Marge,no!
67501,Marge,"bart, isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister?"
67504,Marge,lisa's recital is saturday night.
67505,Marge,"now, come on, you two. what time does your little truck game start?"
67511,Marge,thank you so much.
67513,Marge,"wow, a woman mud-pull driver."
67515,Marge,what a fun-filled evening.
59324,Marge,this chair lift sure goes high...
59325,Marge,finally...
59326,Marge,stop it!
67520,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. a heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try."
59329,Marge,you mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
59330,Marge,who's disco stu?
67525,Marge,"a sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of msg."
59335,Marge,"sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge around the house, but don't be a hero. just make sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp. but not the good tarp. i want you to get married on that some day!"
59345,Marge,"well, it has been a week."
59346,Marge,"i'm home, everybody! gee, the house looks great!"
67542,Marge,"""... in your otherwise fine programming. yours truly, marge simpson."""
67546,Marge,snuh!
59357,Marge,i tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
67550,Marge,i can protect my own children.
67551,Marge,but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four.
67552,Marge,all right.
59359,Marge,"homer, maybe i should drive."
59365,Marge,"i don't know, there's a lot of buzz around lenny."
67559,Marge,no one.
67564,Marge,her group
67566,Marge,violence-in children's-program-ming.
59376,Marge,"stop that! cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like bill crosby and david letterson."
59379,Marge,"homer, who are you calling?"
59384,Marge,"no partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials..."
67577,Marge,yes. i'd like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. thank you.
59385,Marge,"oh no, you don't! i'm not going to let you trash mr. burns' yacht."
59393,Marge,"that is the best version of ""living in america"" i've ever heard."
59395,Marge,"homer, lisa's in that."
59396,Marge,let's forget about the band contest and just have fun at the state fair.
59399,Marge,i wish people would stop telling me to step right up.
67592,Marge,i didn't really expect things to change this much.
67593,Marge,what in the world?
59404,Marge,"honey, don't get obsessed with that. focus on the good things. like this fire extinguisher i got at the fair."
67598,Marge,"well... i guess i can't, which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons."
67601,Marge,"oh, homie. here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other."
59413,Marge,they sound angry... and africanized.
59416,Marge,"i do! i do! wait, no i don't."
67610,Marge,homer!
59420,Marge,"bart? honey, i think you should go play with rod and todd."
59421,Marge,"now if there's anything, anything at all i can do to help out..."
59422,Marge,"you're darn right you are! and you've got lots of other great qualities, too."
59424,Marge,i think it is!
67619,Marge,"yes, i do."
67622,Marge,"well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better. and he mispronounced words that even i know, like abdomen. and his office was dirty. now that i think about it, i'm not sure he's even a doctor."
67623,Marge,"well, i don't know how intense it was..."
59431,Marge,homer? homer?
67625,Marge,"...although he doesn't really like school all that much,"
67627,Marge,it was a little hard on me having him around the house
67629,Marge,"well, we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
59442,Marge,don't panic! don't panic! don't panic!
67643,Marge,"homer, look at me."
59451,Marge,i'm not sure mosquito season is the best time to visit larva lake...
67650,Marge,what would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
59459,Marge,"aww, just like her mommy, maggie senior. so, what did everyone do today?"
67654,Marge,when we're intimate?
67655,Marge,can i just make one suggestion? can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?
59465,Marge,"my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10
69808,243,293,homer simpson: ah"
67659,Marge,sometimes it's fun to use candles.
67660,Marge,because we love your father and enjoy his company.
59468,Marge,"homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. do you know how dangerous that is?"
67664,Marge,"ahem. ""the blackened clouds are forming ..."""
67665,Marge,"""... soon the rain will fall / my dear one is departing/ but first please heed this call / that always will i love you / my one, my love, my all."""
67668,Marge,"his drool! it's warm! he's alive! homer, homer, wake up, you're alive!"
67669,Marge,wake up! you're alive! you're alive!
59482,Marge,just kidding. i would never do that.
67677,Marge,uh... well....
67678,Marge,"lisa, i'd rather tell you a different story. how your father and i first met and fell in love."
59488,Marge,"maybe you should see a doctor, homie. a head doctor."
67683,Marge,"... and in another article, i found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!"
59492,Marge,take 'em off the glass! take 'em off the glass!
67685,Marge,"hm, i guess it's the tissue paper inside."
67687,Marge,"excuse me, is this room 106?"
59506,Marge,"this family has hit a new low. we're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... and it's all your fault."
67699,Marge,"oh, and i-i tutor part time."
59510,Marge,those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
59512,Marge,"you mean, when they marry other people."
67707,Marge,"homer, you're amazing. before you couldn't say bon jour. but now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""allouette""."
67708,Marge,yeah!
59515,Marge,owww.
59518,Marge,restock the possum bar. we're almost out of claws.
67711,Marge,"you know, homer, you're like no one i've ever met before. you're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
59521,Marge,"dang, i wish i could. but in august, our chain gang has to dig for tar."
59527,Marge,"come on, bart. while your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip."
67724,Marge,"i don't know, but it is."
67726,Marge,"artie, please!"
59535,Marge,"hi, little vicki."
67728,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
67729,Marge,"take me home, artie."
67736,Marge,"homer, we talked about cable before. do you really think we can afford it?"
67737,Marge,are you sure this is legal?
59544,Marge,and you look adorable.
59548,Marge,where's lisa?
67742,Marge,bart!
67743,Marge,"bart, you're no longer in sunday school. don't swear."
59552,Marge,sure. it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
59553,Marge,"homer, look, we're invited to otto's wedding!"
67748,Marge,"just charge me something, please."
59561,Marge,"well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
59562,Marge,mm-hmm?
67755,Marge,"are you sure you want to do this, homer? it doesn't look friendly."
59567,Marge,"becky, i know you must feel awful. but at least this didn't happen after you were married."
59577,Marge,"that's very impressive, but i still don't... stop that!"
67771,Marge,she's the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
59579,Marge,"yes. well, i guess i'll go roll socks. it's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done."
59580,Marge,it's red!
59582,Marge,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but i think my family likes becky more than me."
59584,Marge,dead in a week? what are you talking about?
59586,Marge,becky's going to seduce homer?
67783,Marge,it's the hospital.
59593,Marge,"look, i know i don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me!"
67793,Marge,"hmm, well, i met homer in high school. we got married and had three beautiful children."
59603,Marge,"oh, yes. he's kind of everywhere."
59608,Marge,"oh, my. i've been so unfair to becky. maybe i am insane. i mean, i am talking to myself."
67805,Marge,"hello, doctor hibbert? this is marge simpson."
67806,Marge,"doctor, i think lisa has the mumps."
67812,Marge,"for five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. now it's your turn."
59620,Marge,"homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show. finally, i said, ""so, do it! either shit or get off the pot."""
67815,Marge,you just need to develop a callous. see?
67816,Marge,"you see. now that's a sewing finger, honey."
59628,Marge,"bart, what do you mean, you have jury duty?"
67822,Marge,i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
59630,Marge,"something that swings, with the beat of new orleans."
59635,Marge,"so, the next time you see a sheriff, shoot him..."
59637,Marge,"good night, laughlin!"
59642,Marge,i don't like you ogling her.
59643,Marge,"why don't you read ""cathy""? she's hilarious."
59644,Marge,what?!
67845,Marge,"homer, are you sure this is the right way? the road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy."
59656,Marge,go back and get them!
59658,Marge,but you seemed so happy in the ocean. all that playful leaping.
67854,Marge,you can put a little something on top for flavor.
59664,Marge,that's not true.
67857,Marge,i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust.
59665,Marge,out-of-towner tax?!
67860,Marge,no.
67863,Marge,"oh, lisa, this was a bad idea."
67864,Marge,do you really think so? my high school art teacher hated them.
59677,Marge,"well, like all americans, fast."
59679,Marge,"mmmm, these stigmuffins are to die for!"
59681,Marge,"so, mr. king, what tale of horror and the macabre are you working on now?"
59684,Marge,and you'll lose weight?
59686,Marge,"homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip."
67881,Marge,"i'm so sorry, mr. burns."
59692,Marge,when you get a penny from a chum / don't just buy some bubble gum! put it in your cap! put it in your cap! when you find a nickel in the snow / don't just blow it on a picture show put it in your cap / put it in your cap...
59693,Marge,when you spy a quarter in a pie...
67892,Marge,"okay, homer. if you think i can."
67899,Marge,"hmmm, lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and i think you should take her."
67901,Marge,"homer, i've been talking to lisa and i'm concerned about your relationship with her."
59712,Marge,"hmm. well, i'm proud of you. you're such a good provider. kids, come on -- thank your father for the injections!"
59717,Marge,do you want turkey sausage or ham?
59718,Marge,i'm proud that you won the pulitzer...
59720,Marge,"oh, well, that's good... oh."
67916,Marge,it's me!
59724,Marge,"well, i sure don't feel like cooking."
67918,Marge,"hello, krusty."
67919,Marge,crazy horse!
59727,Marge,"once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
67925,Marge,"i keep telling you, ghost sex is nothing. it's worse than nothing."
59733,Marge,i'll do it. i always end up doing it.
67929,Marge,apu?
67930,Marge,"wow -- it's like a renaissance fair, but without all the chubby couples!"
67932,Marge,maybe i should run this by my husband first.
59740,Marge,see? the ladies know what i'm talkin' about.
59741,Marge,i'm right here!
67938,Marge,who are we hiding from?
59751,Marge,you're a pretty girl.
67945,Marge,"thank you, bart -- this frame grab's going on my coffee cup."
67950,Marge,you know who else fell? dr. hibbert!
59759,Marge,"okay, players! that's a wrap!"
67953,Marge,"i need a full-time job to support homer, so he has time to work on his rock music, his erotic etchings, his play-doh theater..."
59764,Marge,"finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder."
59765,Marge,they always pick the guy with the wires.
59772,Marge,"seems like animated shows are everywhere. or were, last year."
59773,Marge,homer!
59775,Marge,are you crazy?! i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
59779,Marge,do you feel smarter?
59780,Marge,"sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere."
59781,Marge,"okay, it's in his brain."
59782,Marge,"homer, get up! up, up, up!"
59799,Marge,let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole.
59800,Marge,what a waste of talent.
59804,Marge,mrs. marge simpson. i'm here to teach an art class.
59811,Marge,"that's charming, sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke."
59815,Marge,"i don't see any anger. i see a yearning for freedom... um, do you have a title?"
59817,Marge,"terrific. bart, sideshow bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
59824,Marge,"honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
59826,Marge,i hope this is okay. it's not very prison-y.
59828,Marge,you remember jack... he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
59830,Marge,i know just where you can get one.
59833,Marge,it's a small liberal arts college. very law-abiding. no convicts at all.
59839,Marge,what's wrong with my sundaes?
59844,Marge,so you really didn't do it?
59845,Marge,"i believe you, jack. now let's get you out of here... wait for my signal."
59851,Marge,"thank you, honey. they come in a squeeze bottle now."
59870,Marge,"ooh. maggie, are your ears burning?"
59872,Marge,"i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
59876,Marge,what? we're not ready to compete!
59878,Marge,"oh, that's okay. bart's doing fine. you just have another beer."
59882,Marge,i'm bart's partner.
59886,Marge,i just wanted to win for once. please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
59888,Marge,"darling, you're so much handsomer than my first husband."
59894,Marge,no we're not. you're going down.
59896,Marge,it's totally unfair for one side to have a professional player.
59901,Marge,"after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner."
59917,Marge,nobody's going home. we're going to see bart's concert.
59923,Marge,i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
59929,Marge,you're really not gonna eat anything?
59932,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share."
59937,Marge,"and kids, you're gonna miss the school bus!"
59940,Marge,"not now, lisa."
59947,Marge,"yep. it's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?"
59957,Marge,"no, no, no. oh, homie!"
59964,Marge,where?
59965,Marge,"ooh, you're right. and that's not his wife."
59974,Marge,who's muntu?
59979,Marge,"ooh, look, everybody!"
59998,Marge,very nice.
60002,Marge,"it's a healthy cereal from europe: ""meus-lix."""
60010,Marge,"calm down! if we hurry, they can reattach your thumb."
60022,Marge,breakfast!
60029,Marge,"hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
60031,Marge,"well, i've already borrowed one car. let's go!"
60037,Marge,except your thumb! and lisa's science project!
60043,Marge,"homer, don't you have any respect?"
60048,Marge,it's a miracle!
60051,Marge,what spinal cord injury?
60055,Marge,why did you put my name on the sign?
60080,Marge,i'm not a cop.
60084,Marge,"homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything."
60086,Marge,what? bart is dead!
60087,Marge,the gypsy said it would.
60089,Marge,"no housework, eh?"
60099,Marge,"bravo, pierce!"
60103,Marge,"oh, pierce. the water's perfect."
60110,Marge,"homer! homer, you're alive!"
60114,Marge,"oh, how magical!"
60119,Marge,"well, maybe it'll be fun. you'll get to spend more time together. make sure your father takes his mood medication."
60122,Marge,no! i don't want you going in a bottle. that's what hobos do.
60123,Marge,"homer, just take him to the bathroom."
60126,Marge,no!
60133,Marge,"you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much i love my kids."
60136,Marge,haven't we been humiliated enough?
60140,Marge,ahh!!
60148,Marge,and help me with this banner.
60155,Marge,"what are you reading, homie?"
60156,Marge,"that's odd. he's outside, digging."
60175,Marge,"burly?! i bought the wrong brand, maggie!"
60176,Marge,i'll just take them right back to the store and-- whoa.
60178,Marge,look at that absorbativity! i've gotta tell someone...
60185,Marge,"oh, it's okay, homie. the bee's all gone."
60188,Marge,person-to-person?!
60192,Marge,you're not going to believe it. that paper towel lumberjack is coming here! for dinner! tonight!
60198,Marge,"do something, mesmerino!"
60199,Marge,we'd better get him home.
60207,Marge,maybe there's murder afoot!
60216,Marge,"lisa, don't sulk. you're on the jumbotron."
60220,Marge,who wants some astro-lemonade?
60225,Marge,fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
60227,Marge,isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
60232,Marge,you should be very upset.
60234,Marge,"oh honey, i'm worried about your soul. i want at least one person from this family to go to heaven."
60253,Marge,we'd better call the police.
60254,Marge,lisa?
60255,Marge,you came back!
60258,Marge,"and don't worry, honey, i'll pray double hard for both of us. now let's get you some christmas cookies."
60265,Marge,how can an iron be a landlord?
60267,Marge,stop fighting!
60273,Marge,"my driving ankle! bart, i know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?"
60281,Marge,"oh, no. she's making him a sandwich."
60283,Marge,bigamy.
60291,Marge,it's got pictures of deformities.
60306,Marge,but we're on hiatus. everyone's everywhere.
60311,Marge,"oh yeah, like erin brockovich."
60312,Marge,i'm not sure i can afford a fancy lawyer.
60317,Marge,"oh, hello homer."
60327,Marge,"please, homie. dump the sugar. for me."
60335,Marge,"homer, you're going to get in trouble."
60340,Marge,how was your day? do you really want to know?
60350,Marge,oh. it's just a false alarm.
60351,Marge,"mm, thank you."
60359,Marge,"well, so much for new homer."
60361,Marge,"well, i'll be in the kitchen if you need me."
60364,Marge,"boy, things are going really good. good, good, good, good, good, good, good. hmm, look at that freckle. i should dig that out."
60365,Marge,"good, good, that feels good."
60367,Marge,don't hurt me! i'm not like you people! i'm loved!
60374,Marge,"oh yeah! it's important to grow-grow-grow, but if you take it to the max-max-max, it's gonna get ugly!"
60375,Marge,that sounds great.
60384,Marge,"artie. artie, no. stop."
60386,Marge,"well, i think you should get in touch with him. you know, just to congratulate him on his success."
60387,Marge,"well, i suppose i could write him a letter..."
60406,Marge,you need that surgery. we'll have to call artie.
60410,Marge,forwards?
60413,Marge,i knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. keep your money. i'm going home.
60414,Marge,send the bill to baron von kiss-a-lot.
60415,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad to see... a tape on the bed?!"
60423,Marge,of course.
60426,Marge,"but, homer..."
60430,Marge,"for god's sake, homer. give them back their flame!"
60435,Marge,it's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
60440,Marge,"oh, i see you drive on the left up here."
60444,Marge,"hi, honey. where's that vicious dog? i made him a biscuit."
60457,Marge,"well, i don't know. i just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
60460,Marge,there is no xfl this year. the league folded.
60466,Marge,the home told us you were dead.
60468,Marge,"all right, grampa. i'll help you get your license back."
60472,Marge,"grampa, i gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie."
60478,Marge,"oh, no. there's gambling. we just have to find it."
60481,Marge,bill.
60484,Marge,"oh, where could your father be?"
60495,Marge,"of course they didn't, honey."
60505,Marge,homer! they must have made a mistake. we'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
60510,Marge,we've been charged for calls to brazil that we didn't make.
60517,Marge,"oh, aren't you sweet? sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy."
60519,Marge,that's right. they have powers.
60527,Marge,what a charming neighborhood.
60529,Marge,homer!
60530,Marge,"excuse me, we think this boy might be here."
60533,Marge,i'll just get her this bracelet.
60537,Marge,that's baby corn.
60539,Marge,that's it. from now on i'm growing all our vegetables myself.
60540,Marge,go away! go away!
60541,Marge,"i've tried heckling them, i've tried jeckling them, it's time i made myself a scarecrow."
60543,Marge,shoo! shoo!
60545,Marge,"homer, i'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom."
60547,Marge,what's that billowing down the stairs? it's smoke!
60562,Marge,"or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
60564,Marge,"homer, these people are professional roasters. don't give them fodder!"
60566,Marge,"so, i guess you can't destroy earth, since so many of your favorite celebrities live and work there."
60568,Marge,"hm, that little girl sure loved dots."
60573,Marge,hm. where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?
60579,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
60580,Marge,"oh, it must be something big. hm. something you did?... no, something you saw."
60582,Marge,how did you find out?
60596,Marge,even better.
60598,Marge,"manjula, come quick! the octuplets said their first words."
60600,Marge,all right! girls night out! exotic male dancers at the golden banana!
60606,Marge,"what's wrong with him, doctor? it can't be mange, i just had him dipped."
60611,Marge,college is no place for a young girl with those quadrangles and study carrels and syllabi...
60615,Marge,in the tree.
60616,Marge,"oh, i can't wait to see my surprise!"
60617,Marge,"a koi pond! it's beautiful. oh you sweet, wonderful man-child. i finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts."
60622,Marge,"well, let me sew that up for you."
60623,Marge,"darn her socks?... i say, darn her! i'll do them and then i'm outta here."
60626,Marge,she's got a set of lungs on her.
60627,Marge,"oh my gosh, she's dead."
60628,Marge,"chief wiggum, homer and i are innocent."
60629,Marge,no!
60635,Marge,"oh homer, what are we going to do?"
60637,Marge,but we're innocent! it was the man with the braces.
60643,Marge,i'll always love you.
60645,Marge,mrs. bellamy?
60647,Marge,i'm back here.
60662,Marge,huh?
60664,Marge,"fat tony, how can you do this?"
60673,Marge,"maude flanders, we the living beseech you to appear."
60677,Marge,"what do you think, homer? does this make my hips look big?"
60678,Marge,aren't you a dear.
60682,Marge,aww.
60686,Marge,one handsome hubby is all i need.
60691,Marge,dr. hibbert? but we heard you'd gone mad.
60694,Marge,"homie, something very creepy is going on here."
60696,Marge,house of pain. this must be where you pay the bill. why am i always so funny when no one's around?
60698,Marge,simpson.
60705,Marge,so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
60715,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, but it's time to come home."
60722,Marge,why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert? i made a pie.
60725,Marge,now your fannies match.
60726,Marge,stop! you'll crush your juice boxes!
60729,Marge,what?
60733,Marge,dad left the milk out / yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck...
60735,Marge,"ooo, look. there's your father."
60738,Marge,sometimes i worry you might think about other women.
60743,Marge,"faced with a problem like this, i wonder, what would oprah do?"
60751,Marge,oh i'll come back all right. and i'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you.
60752,Marge,"oh, sweetie."
60758,Marge,"homie! oooo, homie... hey, what happened?"
60778,Marge,"anyway, you're the only man i want ogling me."
60785,Marge,bart! watch your potty mouth!
60788,Marge,so... when can we go back in our house?
60789,Marge,don't you have any rooms? we can't live in our house for six months.
60790,Marge,"wow, lenny. your apartment is stunning."
60795,Marge,squiggy?
60799,Marge,it takes six hours to make breakfast now.
60809,Marge,he's betrothed to martha take-a-punch.
60811,Marge,"oh no, everything's ruined. our good bellows... our stereopticon... squiggy! homer, your strop! your strop!"
60816,Marge,yeah. if we read books we could form a club.
60821,Marge,"oooh, that place is famous. it's where j. lo hit p-diddy upside the head with gary coleman."
60822,Marge,kent brockman?!
60831,Marge,"these are homer's friends and family. they don't want him dead, they just want him to suffer."
60834,Marge,"oh my, it's stuck!"
60838,Marge,that museum has been nothing but trouble since it opened.
60841,Marge,"it's nice and cool in here, don't you think?"
60843,Marge,i get to tamp the powder!
60847,Marge,"okay lisa, now open the present from your father and me."
60856,Marge,summary emergency!
60858,Marge,there's a happy baby. aren't you? aren't you?
60876,Marge,eight...
60886,Marge,"what to do now. too crazy to go outside, not crazy enough to have imaginary friends."
60890,Marge,"ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? a lemon!"
60896,Marge,you!
60903,Marge,i can't take drugs -- i have so many anti-drug bumper stickers. i'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.
60908,Marge,"hurry up kids, you'll miss the bus!"
60914,Marge,"so then i pop my delts, clench and bam! not a dry eye in the house."
60915,Marge,and that's why i didn't win!
60921,Marge,"you know, i really do miss being a lady."
60922,Marge,"oh, homie."
60945,Marge,"come on, everyone's helping."
60946,Marge,you've gotta get rid of those furbies. they've turned feral!
60951,Marge,"of course, the stock market's been down lately."
60962,Marge,darn it! i keep pouring juice for five.
60963,Marge,i think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
60984,Marge,"oh sure. i mean, not on your father's salary, but i could... give piano lessons."
60991,Marge,poor ned. this is his first jellyfish festival alone.
61006,Marge,"look, can you please just tell us why you've changed the flight paths?"
61030,Marge,sounds good to me.
61034,Marge,"oh, homie. don't let it get you down. so mr. burns doesn't take you seriously? big whoop! who gives a doodle? whoopie ding dong doo!"
61036,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
61041,Marge,uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
61042,Marge,live from new york it's saturday night!
61045,Marge,the box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. and why would a box lie to a person?
61048,Marge,"ooh, look how late it is. let's get you kids some coffee."
61053,Marge,ing...
61057,Marge,huh?
61070,Marge,your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
61079,Marge,and i still do.
61080,Marge,"well, you'll never have to."
61086,Marge,i still think you should have left that at the motel.
61094,Marge,"thir-what year old?!! lisa, you're only eight."
61096,Marge,oh no! they're making beautiful music together!
61103,Marge,"eh, we can spend another week at the ranch."
61104,Marge,that treehouse is never gonna get built at this rate. time to call in the pros.
61107,Marge,"pointy, pointy, spiky, stylish... where's baldy?!"
61108,Marge,"homie, get out of that treehouse!"
61109,Marge,there's no net!
61117,Marge,that cat saved your life.
61118,Marge,he woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
61120,Marge,"oh, a mom's work is never done."
61133,Marge,"i'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, i'm a full-time family chauffeur!"
61135,Marge,how could you both miss the bus to school?
61139,Marge,"hey, i'd like that. i can't. i have to go pick up grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station."
61143,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
61144,Marge,"oh, you're really coming along, homie."
61160,Marge,only with kisses.
61161,Marge,"oh, don't be a wuss."
61164,Marge,"kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. we're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
61166,Marge,i am so tired of that tautology.
61173,Marge,"well, thank you. i'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible pre-teen brave experience."
61177,Marge,our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded native american. say hello to jim proudfoot from the mohican tribe.
61179,Marge,yay!
61186,Marge,exactly. the pre-teen braves.
61189,Marge,"no, there were twelve."
61191,Marge,my baby!
61197,Marge,"grampa, stop!"
61199,Marge,"hmp, i finally caught up with grampa. i found him crying in the cemetery. thanks for taking care of maggie."
61209,Marge,no! we have to find my baby!
61210,Marge,"okay, you can help us."
61218,Marge,"homie, i disagree with your approach to the children."
61227,Marge,it's too nice a day to be outside doing chores. come in and watch tv.
61233,Marge,win your own t-shirt!
61236,Marge,"you always go with your gut. this time, why don't you listen to your brain?"
61241,Marge,i really shouldn't be here -- i have a problem with games of chance. i played candyland with maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
61242,Marge,bet... system... betting system! god is telling me to gamble!
61244,Marge,i'm so proud of you lisa.
61245,Marge,"honey, you could be popular, you've just got to be yourself... in a whole new way."
61248,Marge,"lisa, you look so successful. like you're the wife of a businessman."
61253,Marge,"well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?"
61259,Marge,"yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
61264,Marge,england is so classy. every cab has its own butler.
61265,Marge,you punched out three people on the street.
61270,Marge,"homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever."
61275,Marge,"bart, you're not helping."
61278,Marge,"that was very sweet of the queen, letting you go in exchange for taking madonna back to america."
61284,Marge,homie! what happened to you?
61289,Marge,"you're not going, and that's final."
61296,Marge,"well, i'm proud of you, homie."
61298,Marge,maggie's locked inside!
61304,Marge,"how about jon stewart? he's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
61323,Marge,"no. i'm gonna parcel my anger out over the next few days and weeks, jabbing at you just when you seem the most content."
61326,Marge,i've dreamed of the day you'd say that!
61330,Marge,"well, maggie likes roofi. and babies only like good things."
61348,Marge,"ms. naegle, i'm sorry to surprise you like this, but i thought if we met face-to-face, we could settle our differences."
61354,Marge,"no, the march primary."
61356,Marge,"attention, everyone."
61361,Marge,forget it.
61362,Marge,i guess no one gives a damn about the american family anymore.
61381,Marge,"oh, it's very wise. it's written by a rabbi -- who surfs!"
61384,Marge,you should be glad i did. your father wanted to call you bartzeena!
61388,Marge,"business, what business?"
61390,Marge,"esme delacroix! she wrote ""to kiss a scoundrel!"""
61394,Marge,you work at the nuclear plant.
61403,Marge,scene from moby-dick.
61404,Marge,"""chapter one: starts and beginnings."" ""swim, swim, swim, thought the whale, flapping his... floppers."" brownie break!"
61405,Marge,"""...mayor quimby, disco stu, and our fighting men and women overseas."" well, i finished the ""thank yous,"" time to go back to the novel."
61406,Marge,temperance barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham...
61409,Marge,"for temperance, the days passed on... as did seven of her ten children."
61411,Marge,fine. right after this revision!
61414,Marge,"this story is as dark as those new milky way bars. ooh, that's a good analogy. i'll work it in somewhere. but now i need some romance, pronto!"
61419,Marge,"well, what do you think?"
61431,Marge,oh homie!
61432,Marge,hello?
61433,Marge,dr. marvin monroe?! i haven't seen you in years.
61435,Marge,you told me you liked it! you didn't read it at all! you lied to me!
61436,Marge,well... there is a place called nantucket.
61455,Marge,"bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
61463,Marge,"bart honey, it's a nice day. why don't you play outside?"
61469,Marge,diamondelle?
61473,Marge,we finally have something to put in the wall safe.
61491,Marge,all our children are smart. some are just smarter than the others.
61494,Marge,'got your nose' and other lies...
61498,Marge,"well, i know who you are. and here's something to help you never forget!"
61502,Marge,"lisa, i'm surprised. your sister just wants to learn and be like you. well, maybe she needs a better role model."
61503,Marge,lisa's gone! you have to find her!
61507,Marge,where'd you find these?
61522,Marge,artie ziff!
61524,Marge,no you didn't.
61525,Marge,artie ziff! why are you living in our attic?
61530,Marge,i'm not.
61537,Marge,"okay, fine, he is."
61540,Marge,"artie, thank you for doing the right thing. eventually."
61543,Marge,"well, northern california is wine country -- we could take a tour."
61552,Marge,"homie, you are so cute."
61561,Marge,okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
61574,Marge,"my drinking problem is out of control. at oktoberfest, all i could think about was beer! i couldn't even celebrate... the harvest."
61575,Marge,"look, i'm not sure this place is working. the drinkers are smoking, the smokers are drinking, and the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves."
61583,Marge,"hey, you're right! what i enjoyed was spending time with my husband."
61588,Marge,"well, that's no promise at all!"
61594,Marge,he's eating my beauty!
61600,Marge,"now sweetie, you shouldn't hang around with people who beat you. they're not true friends."
61606,Marge,you're getting acid in the bed!
61617,Marge,"oh, passion's for teens and immigrants. i'm just glad to have someone to look at when i wake up in the morning."
61618,Marge,well...
61625,Marge,"edna's with comic book guy? oh god, she's on the rebound! and you meet the worst guys on the rebound. it's how jackie got her ""o""!"
61628,Marge,yeah! you don't need a husband to be happy!
61634,Marge,i do!
61636,Marge,"stop it! no one was planned! now, we have to pack for great-uncle tyrone's birthday tomorrow. in dayton!"
61645,Marge,"opinion noted. now if you don't mind, your father and i are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy."
61647,Marge,"oh, homie."
61649,Marge,stupid kids ruin everything.
61653,Marge,"honeymooners -- no kids, no worries."
61659,Marge,this is so luxurious! i feel like i'm princess grace and princess di smashed together!
61665,Marge,"no, no. that's the noise the phone makes when you've been on too long. bye now! love you."
61669,Marge,"you're right, but where do we go?"
61670,Marge,step on it!
61676,Marge,"sure, we lied. we lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!"
61681,Marge,you've been to space.
61688,Marge,you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
61690,Marge,i'm not being trampled. what gives?
61694,Marge,"oh, me too..."
61699,Marge,"i know one person who believes you were the pie man, homie... me. i've known it all along."
61707,Marge,"yes... and then your father broke my heart. and if i'd known he was you, i never would have married you!"
61711,Marge,anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner.
61716,Marge,it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes.
61717,Marge,but then your father showed his true colors.
61739,Marge,i swear bart didn't know what he was doing. he was deaf!
61741,Marge,"when we explain our side of the story, the hate calls will end. i won't have to hear ""suck my such and such"" or ""hell this"" and ""bitch that..."""
61743,Marge,"if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, i do hate americans!"
61747,Marge,i can't believe they put us in jail.
61748,Marge,"well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride."
61756,Marge,there's a ship! we're saved!
61759,Marge,"and yet, i miss america."
61764,Marge,why don't you publish your poem?
61765,Marge,"look at you go. type-ity type, type, type!"
61770,Marge,"yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. the garage made it to heaven too!"
61780,Marge,don't worry. we'll be fine!
61781,Marge,"cut me some slack, i'm a widow."
61782,Marge,"bart, where did you get those?"
61789,Marge,"oh, homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor."
61797,Marge,i think you used too much plaster.
61802,Marge,and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen?
61807,Marge,"it's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
61811,Marge,my dessert!
61813,Marge,it's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind. but i think i'm up to it.
61818,Marge,stop! you're tainting my entry!
61821,Marge,why can't everyone just play fair and... did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl?
61823,Marge,i stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust.
61828,Marge,"don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! now who's laughing? huh? huh? me! i'm laughing!"
61830,Marge,what a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say. now i've got to get ready for the finals.
61836,Marge,i look up to you...
61846,Marge,"aunt patty, aunt selma, grandma bouvier and grampa!"
61850,Marge,"i told him to use a land line. okay gang, let's get this party started -- or should i say barted?"
61854,Marge,"lisa, wait..."
61860,Marge,"oh sure, you love me now, but you'll turn."
61861,Marge,aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
61862,Marge,those tadpoles are your lunch?
61865,Marge,it's nice to be appreciated.
61867,Marge,"whaddya say? it'll be blam! bart, lisa and mom. huh?"
61870,Marge,you've never had one before?
61878,Marge,i didn't give your son charity. i gave him self-respect.
61887,Marge,i don't like the sound of that. tomorrow i'm taking you to doctor shapiro.
61896,Marge,chloe sure turned out successful.
61901,Marge,homer.
61904,Marge,i guess.
61906,Marge,"homer, why do you always have to show that to company?"
61914,Marge,"well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in springfield with our sweethearts?"
61928,Marge,"lisa, let me explain what happened tonight. sometimes when your mom has half a glass of wine, she goes cuckoo bananas."
61934,Marge,she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? that's it! she is off the christmas card list.
61936,Marge,"i'm coming, sweetheart!"
61937,Marge,"i'll save you, lisa! whoa."
61939,Marge,nothing's more powerful than a mother's love.
61955,Marge,i can't believe mr. burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party.
61957,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about all of this.
61969,Marge,"well, maybe i'll go to moe's too, seeing as i'm now part owner."
61972,Marge,i'm here protecting our investment. i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
61978,Marge,this place is a diamond / but it's trapped in the rough
61981,Marge,"thanks, moe."
61990,Marge,"howdy, partner! why don't you sit next to us?"
62003,Marge,i'm afraid so.
62009,Marge,really? is it one that will change the sleeping arrangements?
62016,Marge,those are just reese's pieces.
62028,Marge,"oh homie, don't worry. i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea."
62031,Marge,"time for homer's half-time show. get ready, frank."
62037,Marge,"oh did he? homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!"
62044,Marge,"it's ""win a hawaiian getaway week"" on channel six."
62049,Marge,"as long as two people love each other, i don't think god cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
62051,Marge,but reverend... scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament's proscriptions.
62056,Marge,but veronica's a girl's name. did you know that?
62066,Marge,"so veronica, what do you do?"
62079,Marge,i'll take a cart.
62081,Marge,i always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families.
62087,Marge,"well, let's count that anyway."
62088,Marge,it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
62100,Marge,"homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest."
62102,Marge,"hold still, homie."
62103,Marge,just think about the day you found that junior mint in your bellybutton.
62108,Marge,he's cleaning out the garage. i can picture it now...
62114,Marge,"i know, i just wan--"
62118,Marge,we need to start saving!
62120,Marge,that's right. it's much less expensive than the leading clown-based cereal. you just have to assemble it yourself.
62123,Marge,"well, i just think we should be building a nest egg."
62132,Marge,"you shouted it while we were making love! now look here, mister. i pay the bills, i do the budget, and i'm in charge of the money."
62135,Marge,"well i hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause i'm not speaking to you!"
62139,Marge,you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
62146,Marge,you don't belong on the lawn. you belong in your bed with your wife!
62151,Marge,"captain, wait! i have something here that might change your mind!"
62152,Marge,you don't take anything seriously. not even your bankruptcy hearing!
62155,Marge,"oh, i've lost them! i can't see past all the suvs!"
62157,Marge,"we're not quite there yet, but we've opened up a dialogue!"
62159,Marge,now pull over!
62169,Marge,those shelbyvillians are maligning us all. i've never heard such mean-spirited hate-hoots.
62180,Marge,haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
62182,Marge,"homer! homer, where are you?"
62184,Marge,"oh, you must be michael's dad!"
62189,Marge,oooh. smile!
62193,Marge,she's really enjoying alaska.
62196,Marge,"oh, i am so glad you think so."
62200,Marge,"and i'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea."
62206,Marge,it means you have to fix the roof!
62211,Marge,...then take bart to get c-i-r-c-u-m-c-i-s-e-d.
62220,Marge,i don't want to hear any more about ray. tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
62223,Marge,he's become one of them!
62228,Marge,what are you doing? why aren't you fixing the roof?
62235,Marge,you have to understand -- ray doesn't exist.
62237,Marge,"homer, no one has ever seen ray but you."
62238,Marge,i called that bosom bar. the bartender said you were there alone.
62239,Marge,electro-shock?
62241,Marge,when did i agree to that?
62245,Marge,"bart, i spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak. have some."
62247,Marge,"well until that day, i'm still bart's mother, and i don't like him stuffing himself with junk."
62256,Marge,"they're not kidnappers! they're professionally trained child-snatchers, who are taking you to a maximum-security fat camp."
62262,Marge,"bart, what are you doing here?"
62264,Marge,to give these germans das boot? jawohl!
62267,Marge,"vegetables, you've been promoted from side dish to entrée."
62272,Marge,"sweetie, tonight you were perfect..."
62280,Marge,"oh. i see. well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause i'm not driving you."
62285,Marge,"so, you still think i'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings?"
62293,Marge,lisa's going! we're all going!
62297,Marge,you couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! now good night!
62312,Marge,you know what i mean.
62320,Marge,how 'bout this one -- st. jerome's catholic school?
62322,Marge,"don't you touch bead one! homer, maybe we should be concerned. catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on friday..."
62326,Marge,"forget it! and you know, i went to a catholic wedding once. the incense ruined my pantsuit!"
62332,Marge,"well then, i'd like to speak with jesus."
62336,Marge,let's go!
62345,Marge,my hive! my trademark hive!
62352,Marge,homer!
62357,Marge,i don't know.
62359,Marge,"bye bart! i love you, lisa! sleep tight, maggie! today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
62366,Marge,an oogli-boogli!
62367,Marge,i'll call you back!
62370,Marge,exactly!
62377,Marge,"aw, you're a good thing. i know it. let me clean out your ears."
62379,Marge,where is he taking me?
62397,Marge,go back to your own country!
62400,Marge,"lisa, honey. i know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore!"
62401,Marge,"oh, wait a minute. there's no batteries in this thing."
62404,Marge,"homer, can you help me out here?"
62406,Marge,"lisa, do you really want to watch this?"
62407,Marge,what a lousy party.
62408,Marge,"i don't care what apu was in a past life. in this life, he's a blabbermouth!"
62413,Marge,"well, i hope he's accompanied by the ""how was your day"" monster, and the ""foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
62415,Marge,we need professional help.
62416,Marge,"frankly, no. lisa kind of took care of herself. our oldest, bart, was such a handful."
62417,Marge,"homer, stop that!"
62421,Marge,you're watching cartoons!
62427,Marge,dr. hibbert?
62428,Marge,"i hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but maggie is terribly itchy."
62435,Marge,"oh, i'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! it could leave you sterile down there."
62436,Marge,welcome to our pox party. save room for punch -- maggie's bathing in the bowl!
62440,Marge,"all right, we get it!"
62446,Marge,"homer, you're crazy!"
62447,Marge,fine... no!
62453,Marge,uh-hmm.
62456,Marge,no.
62457,Marge,"innocent?! after all i do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. i'm finished with him."
62459,Marge,"so, i got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
62462,Marge,just do it! trust me!
62470,Marge,okay.
62475,Marge,"well, the important thing is we're a family again."
62476,Marge,i'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
62477,Marge,"""dear homer simpson -- mr. burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
62481,Marge,staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
62491,Marge,a bicycle built for two! and i could be one of those two!
62499,Marge,awww. i'll be right down.
62504,Marge,"i'm a little worried. this part of the county is unincorporated. just to be safe i'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone."
62509,Marge,no.
62522,Marge,i think i might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
62524,Marge,just kidding. today's mom knows to seal 'em in mylar so you can never read them again. never ever again.
62525,Marge,where are you two going?
62541,Marge,"your job isn't to worry about me, it's to give me things to worry about."
62542,Marge,sweet home alabama / where the skies are so blue
62557,Marge,this house has such beautiful wainscoting.
62565,Marge,johnson's water seal.
62571,Marge,"bye, ladies. you can text-message me any time."
62572,Marge,how cute. he tried to stay up but he just couldn't make it.
62583,Marge,i thought you liked my hair.
62587,Marge,"wow, this is special."
62590,Marge,we've passed the ponte vecchio bridge three times. i think we're lost.
62594,Marge,"bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?"
62595,Marge,"bart, bob is a family man now. you can't be a bad person if you have a family."
62597,Marge,uh... well...
62621,Marge,they blocked my shortcut!
62626,Marge,"uh-oh. ""i know i'm just a lifeguard, but i want you to run away with me. if you don't reply to this letter, i'll know that you've chosen to stay with abe. but i know in my heart that the baby you're carrying is mine."
62634,Marge,"see, abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
62635,Marge,"well, then you think of something!"
62636,Marge,"oh homie, i always believed you were gonna make it, no matter what that pushy casket salesman said."
62639,Marge,"while the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
62643,Marge,fine.
62644,Marge,my yard sale is a failure. i guess i'll have to give everything to the salvation army.
62653,Marge,i'm out of drugs! see how much money i made?!
62655,Marge,"homer, i hope you get this. i'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail. hurry!"
62660,Marge,poor willie. would you like to spend the night with us?
62674,Marge,we couldn't find a way out.
62677,Marge,huh? / you knew about the coins? / the coins are down here? / etc.
62686,Marge,and how. but this is different.
62695,Marge,"so, you're gonna be ""chillin'"" with me tonight. do you want to play a game?"
62705,Marge,homer! we're not in high school.
62709,Marge,i thought they might enjoy it if i took them here.
62710,Marge,"everything's covered in foam. and it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
62713,Marge,i could never think something that horrible.
62726,Marge,i'm not wearing a hat!
62730,Marge,"what are you doing, homer?"
62732,Marge,"that's very sweet, but i..."
62733,Marge,i'll do it!
62734,Marge,i'll do it.
62737,Marge,how was that?
62741,Marge,"that leaves ""a"" and ""b"" available for overflow. well done!"
62755,Marge,"ooh, your toaster takes bagels. how ritzy!"
62756,Marge,what's with the kimono? are we having lachoy?
62770,Marge,"homie, i missed you so much! put your pants back on."
62774,Marge,"homie, you've been down here for a week, i really think you need- what the hellmann's real mayonnaise?!"
62776,Marge,maybe homer brush teeth first...
62778,Marge,"grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
62779,Marge,where is the baby?
54590,Marge,why don't you just stop playing?
62788,Marge,"should we take all our stuff, or are we coming back on this boat too?"
62789,Marge,"homie, stop! you're not a god!"
54598,Marge,this place is just like the brochure... autumn leaves...bull sessions...
54600,Marge,and did you also know that history is written by the winners?
54601,Marge,"if you think that, you should meet my new professor. professor august has shown me a side of the world i never knew."
62795,Marge,do you have your shipboard entertainments?
54605,Marge,i wish you would support my comments.
62799,Marge,"i see you met our devout leader, ned flandish."
54614,Marge,why don't we put on some music?
54617,Marge,could he be singing about me?
62810,Marge,look!
62811,Marge,an albatross! it can lead us to safety.
54622,Marge,i'm getting you off this stuff.
62814,Marge,"homer, you can tell the third story. bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest."
62816,Marge,"ooh, like the paper towels. go on..."
54625,Marge,okay.
62818,Marge,maybe not so loveable...
62820,Marge,"homer, what should we do?"
54630,Marge,it's true! and we'll all live in cities on the moon.
62827,Marge,"um... i-i think a woman came up with nylon stockings. i mean, probably. we certainly use them."
54636,Marge,"three to five, right?"
54638,Marge,"thank you, professor august."
54643,Marge,steffan!
54649,Marge,"but steffan, i would like to get married some day."
62842,Marge,now this is a house that's ready to be cleaned!
54651,Marge,no you don't!
54656,Marge,this is serious. pay attention!
54658,Marge,homer! dr. hibbert told you to eat healthier!
54660,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, but i've got my calculus final tomorrow."
62852,Marge,"oh, you seem sweet, but i could never have a favorite."
54666,Marge,"whatever you say, little boy."
54667,Marge,what's his name again?
54671,Marge,oh homie! / oh homie!
54672,Marge,"i feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. plus, i'm dead."
62865,Marge,"nope. i'm sorry, admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
62867,Marge,"oh, hey ned! isn't today your cat's birthday? i remember 'cause she shares the date with patty labelle!"
62874,Marge,"i don't know. i should give homer a chance... but on the other hand, i feel nothing for him."
54683,Marge,that is so beautiful.
62875,Marge,mr. simpson?
62876,Marge,"i've had a lovely evening, mr. simpson."
62878,Marge,no! i'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
54687,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
62882,Marge,"that works for hiccups, not amnesia."
62883,Marge,why are we having dinner in shelbyville?
62884,Marge,a mixer? i don't know -- i am still technically married...
54695,Marge,diamonds! i still can't believe he gave me diamonds!
62890,Marge,me too. i can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.
54700,Marge,"with his marriage in this much trouble, he's got a lot of thinking to do."
54702,Marge,we've got a winning hand. we can take the rest of the tricks!
54703,Marge,"ooh, you'd better be careful. the purpose of this game is to make friends. you don't make friends by winning."
54704,Marge,"still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner."
54705,Marge,"don't ask me, i'm just hair. your head stopped eighteen inches ago."
62895,Marge,i've got amnesia and i have three kids.
54707,Marge,how much money did he piss away on this?
62897,Marge,"i may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. and that means a lot to a woman."
62899,Marge,you drink?
62902,Marge,"oh, i don't..."
62904,Marge,uh-huh. and him.
54713,Marge,"hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. maybe i should sit down with them and-- homer, where are you going?!"
54714,Marge,"gosh, what a hunk!"
54716,Marge,"i know what homer's thinking. he's thinking that he really wants a baby now. so this should be the time, ironically, that i'll change my mind and not want one. well, no way! i want one more than ever!"
62911,Marge,what?!
54720,Marge,"c'mon, marge, it's either you, or..."
62913,Marge,"ooh, it's a mugger! i'll hand over all my hugs and kisses!"
54724,Marge,that was our wedding.
54727,Marge,homer! you promised!
54730,Marge,do we have enough glasses?
54733,Marge,"now, homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. remember last year at the winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
54736,Marge,i have never been so embarrassed in my life.
62928,Marge,that was two seasons ago!
54739,Marge,"i want to make sure the kids don't hear. when i was young, i always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
54741,Marge,"homer, i like to think that i'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. but last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
54742,Marge,i'm going to church alone today. you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life.
62939,Marge,"homer, can i see you in the kitchen?"
62940,Marge,"homie, i don't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others."
54750,Marge,"well, i was wondering. do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? i wouldn't ask, except i'm desperate."
62942,Marge,"buck, i guess we can help you out. we'll start tomorrow!"
62948,Marge,maybe we should stop here.
54759,Marge,"... he drinks out of the carton. he never changes the baby. when he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. i guess that's it. oh no. wait. he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. that's all i can think of right now. i guess you're all tired and i want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
54760,Marge,"homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? i can't believe your selfishness. you can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. you're thinking about fishing, even when i'm talking... right now. right?"
54761,Marge,yes.
54765,Marge,do i have to do this?
54770,Marge,"ohhh, homer."
54771,Marge,"oh my, the house looks wonderful. grampa, what's your secret?"
54774,Marge,"so, did you kids have fun?"
62987,Marge,"actually, he's ten."
62988,Marge,"cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
54799,Marge,"oh, homie, you have lots of hair... why did you want to know your blood type?"
62992,Marge,"he's gotta fall asleep sometime, doesn't he?"
62996,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
54809,Marge,oh... thank you.
63002,Marge,"honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
63004,Marge,you could do something nice for lisa.
63008,Marge,"""wisconsin from above,"" ""veterans' day parades,"" ooh, ""smiles of ireland""! redheaded twins? their mother must have her hands full!"
63009,Marge,"well, i like the idea of you as a handyman... and i love the idea of you reading!"
54818,Marge,"well... then i guess the moral is, ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
63011,Marge,someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy.
54821,Marge,maggie!
54822,Marge,"bart, i asked you to watch your sister!"
54825,Marge,i don't know how this could have happened.
54830,Marge,i said crazy house!
54835,Marge,"well, at least we got a free sample of reading digest."
54838,Marge,"homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
54839,Marge,homie... put down your magazine for a minute...
54840,Marge,i thought you might want to snuggle.
63032,Marge,why does lenny need a windmill anyway?
54844,Marge,"how's it going, honey?"
63039,Marge,"oh my god, he'll kill himself! he'll never hear me say ""i told you so!"""
63040,Marge,"homer, i was pretty upset with you, but in the end, i... i... i-beam!"
54852,Marge,"i know, honey, but just sit still."
54854,Marge,imprisoned congressman becomes born-again christian.
63048,Marge,is that the cat?
63054,Marge,"now listen, bub. you go down to those recruiters and tell them bart is too young for the army. i don't want this to be the only memory i have of him."
54863,Marge,"that's the problem. even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the tv instead of getting some much-needed exercise. those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
63056,Marge,"homer, with all the things you've done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the navy -- i never thought you'd join the army!"
63059,Marge,i'd give anything to hear homer's voice.
54871,Marge,homer? homer!
63065,Marge,"colonel, we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."
63071,Marge,"seventy-two lousy events, and grampa hasn't won a single medal."
54880,Marge,oh my lord!
63072,Marge,i wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
63074,Marge,dear pus bag...
54884,Marge,"""for heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... employee-of-the-month!"" ohh, homer!"
54889,Marge,you mean you still haven't made up with him?
54890,Marge,"mrs. van houten, i'm bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
54894,Marge,what makes you think i did it?
63086,Marge,"the story of my life. they get the popsicles, i get the sticks."
63089,Marge,"noooo! i mean, yes!"
54898,Marge,"oh, dear. this is the fifth time he's cancelled. how can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
54901,Marge,"bart, wipe your feet."
54902,Marge,i've got some good news. krusty the clown is coming to dinner tonight.
54904,Marge,who wants to say grace?
63098,Marge,you can't go to work! i need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
54907,Marge,"homer, maybe you better take milhouse home."
54908,Marge,we're home!
54909,Marge,"now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
63103,Marge,"homer, i wanna show the world how i feel about you."
63106,Marge,"no, homer. it's you. my sweet, perfectly imperfect you."
54918,Marge,"good morning, dear."
54919,Marge,"much better! oh good, the curtains are on fire!"
54922,Marge,"that's it, young man. you're coming with me..."
63115,Marge,"dear lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy."
54924,Marge,"my goodness, what's wrong?"
54925,Marge,"it's your father, he's missing."
54927,Marge,"did you have a nightmare, homie?"
63120,Marge,you're getting a husband! and you are going to that party!
63121,Marge,homie...
63122,Marge,"when you're done putting lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day."
54931,Marge,that's a long shot.
63123,Marge,"lisa's sleeping over at janey's. apparently, her mom makes good mac and cheese."
63127,Marge,we'll give you a ride.
54937,Marge,"homer, if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her."
54940,Marge,that's ridiculous.
63133,Marge,i will.
63134,Marge,"listen, uh, gil... i sort of thought... ya know, you'd be on your way by now."
54944,Marge,you sound like you're going to buy a pony. promise me you won't.
63137,Marge,no!
63138,Marge,yes. one. involving you.
63144,Marge,"and that's why i have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even gil!"
54954,Marge,"all right. you got us into this, you get us out."
54962,Marge,"lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
63162,Marge,i'll ask these active seniors if they know gil.
54971,Marge,i don't know.
54974,Marge,this is from the national fatherhood institute. it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
63168,Marge,this is so exciting -- watching a movie outside with the whole town.
63171,Marge,i was so happy on that island...
63176,Marge,"homer, that's too much sugar!"
63178,Marge,yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here. they're the most delicious fish in the ocean.
63184,Marge,what a great day.
63185,Marge,"well, at least they left your underwear on. that was nice of them."
54994,Marge,"i moe, i moe."
54999,Marge,"we'll have a savings account. we've never had one. kids, i think everything is going to be okay from now on."
63192,Marge,how did you make it?
55001,Marge,we heard! isn't it wonderful? we have some great plans for that money.
63194,Marge,"ooo, now that's smooth."
55005,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
63199,Marge,"oh mon cher, i am the luckiest wife in the entire sixteenth arrondissement! let us kiss with the tongues."
55009,Marge,that's very clever.
63204,Marge,you killed my husband!
55013,Marge,"bart, i want you to go down to moe's tavern. i need you to bring your father home."
63206,Marge,"for me, huh? what took you so long?"
55015,Marge,"okay, let's see... ""ahoy maties! if the water turns blue, a baby for you. if purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
63207,Marge,"you spent so much time plotting your revenge, you lost everything that really mattered. come on, kids."
63208,Marge,"so you see homer, revenge only leads to misery."
63211,Marge,this alley looks dangerous. i'd better turn my ring around.
55023,Marge,"homer, do you ever think about the future?"
63217,Marge,"homer, is that you?!"
63218,Marge,"lisa, it was wonderful! i am such a proud hitachee mother."
55028,Marge,our song.
55029,Marge,"actually, she was singing about god."
63221,Marge,"okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. in colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum."
55036,Marge,"well, i haven't said no to you lately, have i?"
63228,Marge,"oh, yes sir... as shocks go, this one's a real zaparoo."
55043,Marge,"well, how about louie?"
63237,Marge,"oh, homie! you make each eight-year interval better than the last!"
55047,Marge,what about bart?
55049,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i said that this is how i pictured my wedding day... but you are how i pictured my husband."
55050,Marge,"well, you may not look like ted bessell, but you're just as nice."
63243,Marge,"homie, you woke up early?"
55055,Marge,i don't know. i heard radiation can make you sterile.
63255,Marge,look at grampa and selma frolicking in the water.
55064,Marge,homer?
55071,Marge,"no, because i love you."
63263,Marge,"okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. for me, it's the family photo album."
55074,Marge,doesn't your job start tomorrow?
63266,Marge,restage the photos?
63267,Marge,"okay, we're recreating our series finale party for ""star trek: voyager."""
63271,Marge,it sure was nice of nasa to send you up again.
63272,Marge,this is a celebrity scandal! we could sell that photo to a tabloid.
63275,Marge,bart gets another try!
63276,Marge,"well, i do like the extra money. but i think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes."
63277,Marge,"oh, it is not! watch me."
55086,Marge,i bet you could have a lot of fun with this. why don't you go show your father?
63280,Marge,"sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. it's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
55089,Marge,"oh, bart."
55098,Marge,"sting, you look tired. maybe you should take a rest."
55099,Marge,"actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums--"
55104,Marge,"hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. i do it all the time. i pretend i'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things i'll tell you about when you're older. do you understand?"
55107,Marge,"i was thinking that while your father and lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
63300,Marge,"i can make her look any way i want -- let's see... hair: blue, shoes: sensible, body type: olive oyl."
55109,Marge,hmm...
63304,Marge,hm... needs more goat soul.
63306,Marge,i was on the computer all night!
63309,Marge,i better check on my elf-self!
55119,Marge,"well, we had fun too. right now, bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
63313,Marge,i was killed... by my own son.
63318,Marge,"don't worry, honey. i'll hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one."
63322,Marge,"i need a dress to wear for my son's big game. he's the star, i'm his mom, and he's my son."
55133,Marge,"now maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
55134,Marge,"extra mustard for bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... light mayo for lisa, cut off the crust... double bologna for homer...."
55135,Marge,one at a time! one at a time!
63326,Marge,"good morning, sweetie."
63335,Marge,my baby!
63337,Marge,besides that!
63339,Marge,i always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. but now i know it's the truth.
63343,Marge,i'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
55154,Marge,i swear.
63347,Marge,i wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
63349,Marge,"uh... the batter hit it by accident, not by design."
55161,Marge,don't.
55163,Marge,hi homie. i feel much better.
55165,Marge,uh-huh.
55166,Marge,oh.
63358,Marge,lisa! stop reading mastheads!
63362,Marge,"homer, i think you dominoed this."
55175,Marge,maybe we should let the dog in?
55176,Marge,i think he needs a dog house.
55177,Marge,i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
55178,Marge,i am not!
63371,Marge,"well, uh..."
63377,Marge,styrofoam?
55186,Marge,"yes, homer."
55187,Marge,"no, homer."
63379,Marge,"ooh, look! pine-cone first ladies!"
63385,Marge,eat some corn!
55194,Marge,"oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
63386,Marge,he needs something with your father's scent.
55197,Marge,we'll all help.
55201,Marge,how shall we end it?
63398,Marge,all out! i can't make my famous raisin sponge-cake without raisins! kids love the zing of raisins!
55207,Marge,you hit so many home runs this year. what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you?
63399,Marge,i saw it first! / you are such a liar!
63401,Marge,"now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
63406,Marge,"raisin cake! who wants raisin cake? don't worry, it's not too moist!"
63407,Marge,i gave you ten dollars.
55230,Marge,"we have three kids, homer."
63422,Marge,marge takes off in a sprint .
63425,Marge,"how you holdin' up, maggie?"
63429,Marge,"oh hi, kids. you're just in time to go to the dentist!"
55240,Marge,oh dear!
63433,Marge,which one?
55242,Marge,i know you're upset --
63436,Marge,"i invited him to stay with us for a few days. his career is ruined, and i was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide."
55245,Marge,you are not going to perform that operation yourself.
63437,Marge,you'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of fox news.
63442,Marge,this is colby krause. i hired him to help you improve your life. he'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
63445,Marge,"so, how was your first day at your new job?"
63449,Marge,"look at this business center -- fax, wi-fi, teleconferencing capabilities... i'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!"
55263,Marge,you can pet the cat.
63460,Marge,griddler on the roof? thank god it's fried eggs? luftwaffle's?
63461,Marge,bodacious frittatas? buffet the hunger slayer?
55270,Marge,well of course he's a spy. you just saw him go through spy school!
63463,Marge,forget it! one day a week i should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
55272,Marge,"homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. homer?..."
63470,Marge,where's bart?
55282,Marge,don't lie to me. are you having an affair with this woman?
63475,Marge,i want you to stop flirting with women.
63477,Marge,homie... i miss our alone time. i miss you.
63479,Marge,we're trapped. your fans will rip us to pieces.
55290,Marge,mrs. homer simpson.
55294,Marge,i gotta go. homer...
55303,Marge,"now kids, i know you're all excited about meeting aunt selma's new boyfriend tonight."
55304,Marge,"now, now, he's an ex-convict. he's paid his debt to society."
63507,Marge,one hug can't hurt!
55322,Marge,"hmmm, i hope my poor little baby's okay."
63515,Marge,"at least you need me, sack of potatoes."
63516,Marge,"homer, you do know what tomorrow is."
55326,Marge,i meant a real guitar.
55330,Marge,what conversation?
55331,Marge,that's not my voice!
63523,Marge,"really? look at you... so grown up... well, i've moved on too..."
63524,Marge,are you sure? hugs are dru--
63531,Marge,that old man over there isn't even making a transaction. he just wants someone to talk to!
63533,Marge,homer! i'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
63538,Marge,i just want to go home.
55348,Marge,don't you usually play with milhouse after school?
55349,Marge,milhouse?
63540,Marge,you said you visited him every night.
55355,Marge,oh.
55356,Marge,you mean a spoon?
55360,Marge,this money was a blessing. we can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
63553,Marge,"oh, poor johnny stabbo..."
63554,Marge,"don't give up hope, johnny!"
63555,Marge,dwight?! i was just on my way to see you in prison.
63558,Marge,"um, what are we doing here?"
55372,Marge,"maggie, you talked!"
63568,Marge,thank you.
55377,Marge,"bart, where's your bathing suit?"
63569,Marge,"you see, the problem is, we've grown apart."
63570,Marge,another thing... i don't know where you go at night.
63571,Marge,"well i won't be home either. i'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains."
63572,Marge,and you have fun at your ridiculous event.
55383,Marge,ohhh...
63575,Marge,uh... a blender cozy.
55386,Marge,"dear kids, i hope this letter finds you well. we are doing great. your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever."
55387,Marge,we miss you terribly. i hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
63579,Marge,how could you not tell me you were an assassin?
55389,Marge,"oh... homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks."
55392,Marge,"i haven't been in a play since high school, and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults."
63584,Marge,"sweeties, we weren't fighting..."
63590,Marge,we can't have a space creature living in our house.
55404,Marge,"i'll come home right away. all right, i'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken... extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait..."
63597,Marge,you don't know what color my eyes are?
63598,Marge,no peeking. i'm wai-ting.
55407,Marge,"no, homer."
63602,Marge,"so you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!"
63604,Marge,"and until they do, you can stay here."
63607,Marge,why don't we do something special for you -- get you all snazzed up.
63611,Marge,"oh homie, i'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me."
63614,Marge,"i've lost my perfect twenty-six, twenty-six, twenty-six figure."
63615,Marge,never compare yourself to a standee.
55424,Marge,the play's tomorrow night. ah've got to stay in character.
63616,Marge,i'd better join a gym before i go from hippy to hippo.
55427,Marge,"see you later, kids. ah've got to go rehearse with ned."
55428,Marge,"for god's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!"
55429,Marge,"keep yelling, you big ape."
55434,Marge,what kooky projects?
55438,Marge,i thought my life would be a mardi gras/ a never-ending party -- ha!/ i'm a faded southern dame without a dime...
55443,Marge,"oh, come on, homer. by the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up."
55446,Marge,"no, homer, you got it just right."
63640,Marge,"listen, homer, i gotta be honest with you..."
55453,Marge,your father is... resting.
63645,Marge,"without the commercial interruption, i could really follow the story. tivo, you've got a season pass to my heart."
55455,Marge,"that's a terrible thing to say. kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
63654,Marge,stop it! stop it!!! i'll watch the commercials!
63657,Marge,eh.
63658,Marge,yowza!
55467,Marge,i'm only going to ask you one last time. are you sure you won't come with us to church?
55468,Marge,"oh, homey! are you all right?"
63659,Marge,that's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
55470,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad to hear you say that."
55471,Marge,we have one at home. you never use it.
63661,Marge,"well, i guess the rest of us should pay our respects."
55473,Marge,"lisa, i know a song that will cheer you up. there once was an ugly duckling..."
63667,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way. we were planning a surprise party for you."
63670,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
55480,Marge,"oh. well, yes, that's what i meant, too. well, tell you what. this afternoon, i'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
63682,Marge,i wonder who that could... beeee!
63684,Marge,"speaking of disasters, have you seen this? springfield dodge bought too much inventory, and they've only got one weekend to get rid of all the '07s!"
55499,Marge,"you know, you look a little flushed. maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people."
63694,Marge,"unfortunately, as i later learned, that wasn't heroin. it was insulin."
55505,Marge,whoa!
63698,Marge,well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- homie is where my heart is.
55507,Marge,it's our only hope.
55509,Marge,"homer, get back here."
55511,Marge,that's the way we do it every year.
63705,Marge,"kids, knock it off. i'm uncomfortable driving your father's car as it is."
55514,Marge,"oh, all right."
55515,Marge,"well, i'm sorry... i'm sure bart doesn't really mean to be bad."
55518,Marge,"homer, we have a problem here."
55522,Marge,"oh, my poor baby."
63714,Marge,"your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying. so i hired this nutritionist, betsy bidwell."
55526,Marge,"no, no, no."
63720,Marge,this is my husband...
55533,Marge,how could you let this happen?
55534,Marge,i wasn't here!
55535,Marge,"homer, do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper?"
63730,Marge,"zack, you're not trying to help our marriage, you're trying to split us up! i'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy!"
55539,Marge,"homer, we'd like to talk to you."
63732,Marge,"a ballet academy here in springfield?! move over, europe!"
55544,Marge,did you notice how slanted he looked?
63739,Marge,"wait, you mean she danced well, into her seventies? or she danced, well into her seventies?"
55551,Marge,"where does the bible say ""racket?""...."
63745,Marge,teach?
55555,Marge,curator of large mammals?
63751,Marge,"there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. look at me, i'm glowing!"
63753,Marge,who was that?
55564,Marge,"but, where does it go?"
63759,Marge,are you calling me fat?
63761,Marge,she turned down lenny... and carl? that's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hotdogs. what could make her hate men like that?
63763,Marge,"lurleen lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and i'm gonna fill it."
55573,Marge,oh really? i came to see you three times today. twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
63766,Marge,"hello, are you royce lumpkin?"
55581,Marge,it's 9:30 in the morning.
63773,Marge,i'm really worried about lurleen.
63774,Marge,and major marge!
55587,Marge,"oh, you speak so politely to adults."
63782,Marge,every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs! i want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial!
63784,Marge,"and bart, you go with your father to shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs re-beaned."
63785,Marge,"honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars."
63786,Marge,we're putting a stop to this right now!
63788,Marge,stop the wedding!
63791,Marge,"sweetie, don't you think your mom might have a trick up her sleeve?"
63797,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
55606,Marge,"we drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""all you can eat"" fish restaurant."
63800,Marge,"homie, she's not making a snuggle film."
63802,Marge,"ooo, ""candyland."" a great family game is now a great family movie!"
55615,Marge,no. no. could you wear the mr. plow jacket. just uh... for fun.
63812,Marge,"we listened to music radio in the car... and, since you kids behaved, we'll pick one fun thing to do here."
55623,Marge,"according to 'fretful mother' magazine, if maggie doesn't talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender."
55632,Marge,no.
63825,Marge,"maggie, that's the same garry that filmed your birthday party. remember, he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight."
63826,Marge,"hmm, it smells like concerts!"
55638,Marge,won't that warp him?
55644,Marge,"we were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect..."
63838,Marge,they took my cupcakes!
63839,Marge,"thank you so much, mister..."
63842,Marge,"here we are at school, kids."
55653,Marge,i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born.
63845,Marge,"i already don't! homer, i've got great news!"
55655,Marge,here she is!
55657,Marge,homer!
55659,Marge,"well, i'm not surprised. lisa's crazy about you. she thinks you hung the moon."
55661,Marge,"honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed."
55663,Marge,"homie, what is it?"
63859,Marge,"homie, what do you say we go to bed? you, me and the cake?"
63861,Marge,"sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. as it is, i'm buying frozen peas on installments."
55680,Marge,"oh homie, i could never remarry..."
63872,Marge,"well, sweetie... i know i said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, i think it's important that we're in touch."
63873,Marge,like a big-mouthed bass.
55688,Marge,my name is marge simpson and i have an idea. it may sound a little boring at first...
63880,Marge,it shows you care.
55690,Marge,many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
63886,Marge,are we ever going to find him?
55695,Marge,"your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
55702,Marge,mr. lanley? mr. lanley?
55705,Marge,who are you?
55707,Marge,homer.
63902,Marge,that was unforgivable. but i'm beginning to think that bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase.
63903,Marge,"no flicking boogers, and no driving into trees!"
55714,Marge,and that was the only folly the people of springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.
63907,Marge,no more non-dice board games.
63908,Marge,i just did.
63911,Marge,"homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!"
55720,Marge,"homer, that's very rude of you."
55721,Marge,"while we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember great aunt gladys."
63914,Marge,scrubbing you / is easy 'cause you've been pre-rinsed / and when you're covered with goo / that's when i'm scrubbing you! / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub / scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub...
63915,Marge,i don't like the look of those air quotes.
63916,Marge,"now, we tuck in the tummy, the tushy and the tootsies."
63917,Marge,"homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers. they don't look like the stabby kind."
55726,Marge,mr. hutz!
55727,Marge,selma! your date's over already?
63920,Marge,of course we were.
63922,Marge,"well, we thought we'd wait a little while."
63923,Marge,"um, how long have you two been married?"
63924,Marge,"homer simpson, i would be delighted not to marry you."
55734,Marge,are you going to eat it?
55738,Marge,do you feel any better?
63930,Marge,that's how low you can go!
63931,Marge,why are you dancing with that strange woman?
63935,Marge,"there's absolutely nothing to worry about! i'm in my own room, being chaperoned by an actual christian."
63936,Marge,but i can't take a dress from a man who looks so good and smells so clean.
55745,Marge,i can't. the beans'll burn.
55750,Marge,"no, no. someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""the corey hotline."""
63946,Marge,"okay, but first the chest."
63950,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil! but i think we should unpack first..."
63953,Marge,she's not here!?
55762,Marge,"honey, honey, i'd tell this boy that you're very flattered, but you're just not ready for this kind of thing."
63954,Marge,you make me feel that way too.
63956,Marge,don't be silly. our marriage can weather any storm -- just like this tree.
63958,Marge,"homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! it's in us! now take my hand!"
63959,Marge,/
63962,Marge,have fun!
55771,Marge,"homie, do you ever drink alone?"
55774,Marge,do you ever hide beer around the house?
55775,Marge,do you ever drink to escape from reality?
55777,Marge,i want you to give up beer for a month.
63971,Marge,"jackie ""o."" like spaghetti-o's. i thought that was where her money came from. look, why don't you cheer up by doing a new york times crossword puzzle, huh?"
55780,Marge,what was that noise?
63972,Marge,it might be a fun way to kill a couple hours.
55786,Marge,but you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look.
55788,Marge,but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red...
63983,Marge,never being a grandmother?
63985,Marge,stop milhousing your sister!
55794,Marge,lisa needs braces.
63987,Marge,i don't know. all it takes is one troubled loner.
55796,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55798,Marge,lisa needs braces.
63990,Marge,"your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people."
55802,Marge,"president of the union! i'm so proud of you, homie."
63998,Marge,woo-hoo!
64000,Marge,i just said that.
55816,Marge,it's true. you have good coping skills.
55818,Marge,"society's loss, i suppose. but our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
55821,Marge,"mr. burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
64015,Marge,no!
55825,Marge,you lost five percent of your brain.
55826,Marge,"""third notice,"" ""final notice,"" ""some guys are coming.""... ooh, what's this?"
64019,Marge,sounds promising so far!
55834,Marge,"that was ""happy days."""
55836,Marge,i know.
55838,Marge,homer!
55839,Marge,shhhh.
55842,Marge,now remember bart. this is a religious school. so be very careful about what you say and do here.
64035,Marge,just stop.
55846,Marge,i think i'll unplug that.
64045,Marge,i don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
55855,Marge,slow... then fast.
64047,Marge,oh my god! oh my god! we're totally liable!
55857,Marge,"now, hurry up or you'll miss your bus."
55858,Marge,there is no such thing.
55859,Marge,"grampa, you know you can't have liquids after three p.m."
64049,Marge,homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. i'm afraid it's growing out of hand.
64050,Marge,your majesty... did you remember to invite ned flanders?
64053,Marge,that number's so big it has a comma!
55864,Marge,mr. hutz! this was all a misunderstanding. i didn't mean to take anything.
64059,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe what you doodily-did for us."
64064,Marge,"um... do you have time to look at a few other leaks, faulty wires and dangerous mold conditions?"
55874,Marge,it's so nice not to have to cook.
64066,Marge,it's irresistible. you ask him to do something and he does it. he's like a
55877,Marge,oh my goodness.
55878,Marge,what kind of slime would i marry? i don't understand.
55880,Marge,"oh honey, i've missed you too. homer, is that an old halloween costume?"
64072,Marge,"homie, i think it's an eviction notice. we're gonna be homeless, like lucille ball in ""the stone pillow""!"
64073,Marge,"you know, it says here that grampa has to remain in the house, but we don't. how about a family outing?"
64078,Marge,it's beautiful!
55889,Marge,have you seen bart?
64085,Marge,"i'll be right in, lisa!"
64088,Marge,keep going and i'll scat.
64091,Marge,a mother knows!
64101,Marge,"wait a minute, who am i pleading with?"
55911,Marge,"you don't know, do you?"
64104,Marge,i feel like we're forgetting something.
64105,Marge,we'll make it up to you. we'll do something you've always wanted to do but never got the chance.
55914,Marge,"homer, please. these boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
64106,Marge,"bart, if you hate belgium so much, maybe i should take your tintins away!"
55918,Marge,no. i want those geeks out of my house.
55919,Marge,"an ""a plus""! how did you do it?"
55920,Marge,you changed your grade with a computer?
64110,Marge,come back here!
64113,Marge,like it was yesterday...
64114,Marge,kirk and luann split up...
55924,Marge,what are you doin'?
64120,Marge,this isn't the most romantic place to get married.
55935,Marge,"i don't hate you, i'm proud of you. you came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
64127,Marge,that's for a child's birthday. we're going to get this one.
64132,Marge,"all right, people, i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation."
64133,Marge,"there is no ""we"" in wedding!"
55942,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
55947,Marge,"read the back, the back."
64139,Marge,a pimple! not on my day you don't!
64144,Marge,"homer, that's you!"
64149,Marge,i'm afraid i'm just... ms. simpson now.
55958,Marge,"i'd like to pledge thirty dollars. oh, thank you!"
64152,Marge,"oh, i've missed your nonsense."
64155,Marge,blue roses!
55966,Marge,would you two like to go to the ballet?
64160,Marge,maggie.
64162,Marge,those are two different people!
64163,Marge,"oh! okay, i'm coming."
64171,Marge,"homer simpson, you are a strong finisher."
55983,Marge,oh... i've heard a lot about shot kickers.
64176,Marge,that's it! we're getting you off the meds!
64177,Marge,"man, i love saturdays! finally, i can have fun with something i bought for myself -- a new water heater!"
64179,Marge,five more water heaters and we get a free water heater!
55988,Marge,what was it you wanted to show me?
55995,Marge,me too.
55996,Marge,there's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
55997,Marge,maybe we should call it a night.
55998,Marge,i think they want us to stop.
64189,Marge,noah. i like that name. no-ahhh. noah. noah!
64196,Marge,"feeling better, super dad?"
56005,Marge,"well, bye."
64198,Marge,it's like drinking e. e. cummings!
64200,Marge,gotta find a place to tinkle.
64201,Marge,"schools have bathrooms! and i'm a woman, so my going in unattended won't cause a panic."
56010,Marge,"i'm sorry, i should have asked first."
64205,Marge,that's an awfully crowded classroom.
56017,Marge,i don't know if this is a good idea.
64210,Marge,thank you!
64218,Marge,let's go.
56027,Marge,shhh!
56030,Marge,"homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
64223,Marge,a key to your apartment!
56032,Marge,"i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
56033,Marge,good. i'm glad we had this talk.
64225,Marge,surprise! i redecorated!
64228,Marge,where have you been? we have mirrors to hang!
56037,Marge,his name is bart.
64231,Marge,fine! you can have your key back!
56042,Marge,money's too tight for steak.
64237,Marge,"a woman can be smart, beautiful and powerful. like queen elizabeth the first! she had it all, except the most important thing."
64238,Marge,"no, a husband!"
64244,Marge,and she lived happily ever after?
56053,Marge,"hey, there's a turkey behind the bed."
56060,Marge,"hi, homie."
64254,Marge,tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... dr. hibbert as banquo?!
56065,Marge,"now you stay put, young lady."
64264,Marge,now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare's greatest roles: king lear... hamlet...
56073,Marge,what happened here?
64265,Marge,othello... richard the third...
64269,Marge,"ooo, ""the fountainhead."""
64270,Marge,"so, anyway, this is the story of maggie roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
56079,Marge,"lisa's costume. homer, i didn't realize. i'm so sorry."
56081,Marge,that's true. will you forgive me?
64273,Marge,he would not let maggie's creativity flower:
64274,Marge,maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect.
56085,Marge,homer! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom.
56089,Marge,"oh, stop blaming the beans."
64284,Marge,ooh.
56093,Marge,oh my! i had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
64285,Marge,come and get me.
64288,Marge,yes!
56104,Marge,"yes, he's raking leaves."
56107,Marge,"lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
64299,Marge,uh-huh...
56111,Marge,ooh. that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
56112,Marge,but that's the longest.
56114,Marge,their floors are sticky-mart.
64309,Marge,"chett, i'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
64312,Marge,what? that's crazy.
56121,Marge,hm. i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
64314,Marge,"thank you, homie."
56123,Marge,"i had a malibu stacy when i was little, and i turned out all right. now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
56129,Marge,"you know, homer, when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions. first i was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
64322,Marge,someone should tell your principal!
56132,Marge,"but on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
64324,Marge,nobody needs to know that! skip ahead!
64326,Marge,that's. my. son.
56135,Marge,who wants ginger snaps?
64330,Marge,"i'd just like to say one thing. i only agreed to this fight because i wanted to stop the violence. and sure i got into great shape and met some fun people, but i ended up discovering my own dark side. so from now on, the only thing i'm fighting is this cold i'm coming down with."
56139,Marge,"oooh, the walls are melting again."
56141,Marge,homer!
64333,Marge,"no. let's go home. we can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
56143,Marge,"homer, that's our wedding photo."
64337,Marge,we don't have a panic room!
64338,Marge,i can't shoot her. she's lisa's godmother.
64341,Marge,"homie, where have you been?"
56150,Marge,sandwich.
64347,Marge,he what?!
64350,Marge,it tastes like hot steaming cocoa mixed with rainbows...
56159,Marge,"homer, what's going on down there?"
64353,Marge,that does sound like homer.
56162,Marge,or double-ply windows! they look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
56167,Marge,"ew, homer, there is a bird on your head?"
64365,Marge,"mmmm, i love this wine."
64369,Marge,what's all the hubbub-aloo?
56180,Marge,i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now. isn't there something you'd like to say?
56182,Marge,"no. you know, bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
56185,Marge,"homer, say something."
56189,Marge,what about peter fonda?
56191,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
56192,Marge,"that's sweet, honey."
64384,Marge,why don't you just roll me?
56194,Marge,"homer, i want that thing out of my house."
56195,Marge,"i'm not sure if i'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. how would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
64388,Marge,"ned, to make up for what happened, i want to invite you and the boys over to dinner tomorrow night."
64389,Marge,ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-mie... ho-...
56199,Marge,"ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
56200,Marge,what's going on in there?
64393,Marge,"it's fun to cook dinner together. homer and i never do it anymore. cook together, that is."
64396,Marge,"oh, nothing fancy..."
64397,Marge,strawberries and whipped cream.
64399,Marge,your perfectly-trimmed mustache...
64401,Marge,"homie, you're back!"
64402,Marge,"boy, that was worth the wait."
56213,Marge,"maggie, we have a surprise for you."
56215,Marge,"yeah. anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""periodicals,"" that's it."
64408,Marge,what a smart way to spend a snowy day.
56217,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
64412,Marge,oh what a lovely evening.
56223,Marge,"grampa, sssh! i know my mother. if you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away."
56224,Marge,"uh... i love ya, mom!"
56225,Marge,i love ya! i love ya! i love ya!
64415,Marge,"homer simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our dvd player."
64417,Marge,"the yawning monkey? ""the pair of tongs?"""
56228,Marge,"he's an awful, awful, awful man, but i guess if he makes mom happy, that's all that really matters."
64418,Marge,okay!
56237,Marge,"homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. you've ruined a perfectly good jacket."
64432,Marge,what a nice note!
56241,Marge,"homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class."
56247,Marge,what the darn...?
64442,Marge,potato!
56251,Marge,get out! get out! get out!
64445,Marge,and toast... valerie and daaaaave!
64446,Marge,"homie, i'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people..."
56257,Marge,funny... the way everything reminds me of homer.
64453,Marge,"did i hear ""lettuce?"""
56264,Marge,"but, how do i know i can trust you?"
64458,Marge,seven-oh-seven? that's exactly the moment i was furious at you for missing our toast. and now i'm the one who has to ask... can you forgive me?
56267,Marge,"homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. although i must say, it's certainly refreshing."
56268,Marge,won't this overload the motor?
64460,Marge,that's just what we need! but how are we going to get it home?
64466,Marge,you were what?!
56278,Marge,"lisa, stop blowing my sex! i mean, stop blowing your sax. your sax. stop it."
56281,Marge,"i don't know, honey. i guess that's the school's decision to make."
64474,Marge,thank you.
56285,Marge,"well, you'll always be number one to me..."
56287,Marge,"oh, for chri..."
56291,Marge,homer?
64485,Marge,the realest thing i've ever done.
64486,Marge,"hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
56295,Marge,"look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?"
56296,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
56298,Marge,wake up!
56304,Marge,i knew i shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
56306,Marge,"yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy? children, your father and i have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. it's time to learn about love."
56307,Marge,i mean romance not love.
56310,Marge,all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
56317,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
56319,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
64511,Marge,"very good, bart."
56321,Marge,hmmm.
64514,Marge,"ooh, good idea. bart, what are you doing for black history month?"
56326,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
64518,Marge,"""pork butt in cream,"" ""snout-fried neck,"" ""frog haunch,"" ""hooves au jus,"" ""possum pouch pie..."""
64525,Marge,"ooo, a hundred and three! no school today."
56342,Marge,good. does anyone else have a love story?
56348,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
64540,Marge,the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
64542,Marge,you practiced all day on my birthday!
64551,Marge,it's working!
56362,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
56363,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
64554,Marge,nope.
64555,Marge,"""mom and dad, bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary!"""
64560,Marge,homer?
56369,Marge,it's shaped like a diner. and it's on this really tall pole.
56370,Marge,hmm?
64561,Marge,i thought you were fixing my brakes!
64563,Marge,why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
56375,Marge,this year i want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
56377,Marge,"what's the matter with you, homer? we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."
56381,Marge,"oh, please. it was just a figure of speech."
56382,Marge,"when do you show the consequences? on tv, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. but in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
64576,Marge,"shalom to you! shalom is the ""aloha"" of this place."
56387,Marge,you're sure she'll have fun here?
64583,Marge,okay.
56393,Marge,yuh-huh. i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. are you kids gonna be alright?
64587,Marge,"really? okay, eat your lunch."
64588,Marge,you said it's your lunch. eat it.
56400,Marge,i have nothing to say to you.
64593,Marge,"shopping. every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. you stay here."
64596,Marge,of course you do. dylan's a... hm... let me check the invitation...
64598,Marge,there's gotta be a clue here somewhere.
64600,Marge,what kind of a party has two activities? they're just trying to confuse me.
56411,Marge,"bart, i wish you wouldn't lie like that."
56412,Marge,"homer, we've got to stop them."
64603,Marge,dealing drugs? that's impossible. he... he doesn't have the math skills!
56415,Marge,"homer, i'm impressed. you're taking this quite well."
56419,Marge,"feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
64614,Marge,"homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
56423,Marge,"hello, police? this is marge simpson. my husband is on a murderous rampage. over."
56425,Marge,"oh my, i hope that rug was scotchguarded."
56426,Marge,dad!! daaadd!! homer!!
56427,Marge,it's bliiiiisssss.
64620,Marge,"lisa, sweetheart -- it's almost dinnertime. why don't you come home?"
56429,Marge,hmph. it's raining again.
56431,Marge,homer! the sky is blue. donuts are plentiful. friday is tgif night on abc. what's gotten into you?
56434,Marge,"relax, honey. you were just having a crazy nightmare. you're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out."
64630,Marge,"homer, maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween. what's going on?"
56442,Marge,that's not what i meant.
64636,Marge,that's something you've been putting off.
56445,Marge,"homer, stop that. i believe him."
64637,Marge,why do i waste my breath?
64639,Marge,homer? i'm-- you!
64640,Marge,we're breaking up!
64641,Marge,homer?
56450,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning. i really hope you try harder."
56451,Marge,cheer up. so you're not good at sports. it's a very small part of life.
64642,Marge,homer my mother's party's starting any minute. get busy.
64644,Marge,every time i plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.
64648,Marge,my mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
56457,Marge,"bart, i can spend some time with you."
56460,Marge,i told you to watch out.
56463,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
64656,Marge,why on earth do you think that harmless-looking man...is sideshow bob?
56467,Marge,"moe, i think you should leave."
56468,Marge,no.
64659,Marge,"honey, his name is walt warren, and he's a very nice man. he stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car."
64661,Marge,what are you doing?! you're indoors at an outdoor party!
64663,Marge,i can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all.
56475,Marge,"well, that's the babysitter. no one in town will sit for you two anymore. i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."
64667,Marge,the paper's here.
64671,Marge,"walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?"
64677,Marge,"ooo, everyone's coming over to congratulate us! humble faces, kids!"
64678,Marge,humbler!
56487,Marge,"homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. it's not gonna happen."
56488,Marge,"look, maybe this whole thing will blow over."
64682,Marge,we can enjoy each others' company.
56495,Marge,there are only forty-nine stars on that flag.
64687,Marge,you know what? i'll just cook this later.
56497,Marge,"groundskeeper willie saved you, homer."
64689,Marge,that's nice. what kind of favor?
64692,Marge,homie! i thought you were at that sports bar.
56505,Marge,a tasteful book.
56507,Marge,"oh, i'm just reading up on, artillery."
56508,Marge,"this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. it's a book on tape by paul harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa."
56510,Marge,"homeie, i can't quite..."
64702,Marge,"well, you could get some ice cream, or...spend a week at performing arts camp!"
64706,Marge,your week's up! time to go home!
56515,Marge,"oh, homey, what's--"
56519,Marge,"homie, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life?"
64711,Marge,bup-up-up! safety locks!
56525,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden."
64717,Marge,"it's not your fault, grampa. these cards are too slippery. see?"
64719,Marge,now remember what grampa said: you can spend the money any way you want.
56530,Marge,"yes, but i'd rather not talk about it."
56533,Marge,sure as sugar.
64725,Marge,why wouldn't i?
56535,Marge,"judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
64728,Marge,i'll take it!
64730,Marge,"don't worry, homer -- i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
56542,Marge,"i'm sorry, doctor. he's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him."
56543,Marge,but it's a few seconds before 12:00.
64734,Marge,thank god!
64738,Marge,thank god! i will never do that again.
56550,Marge,"i keep having the same dream. i'm the mother from ""lost in space."""
64743,Marge,"you know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them."
56553,Marge,"no, i didn't."
56559,Marge,why does daddy have to leave?
64753,Marge,lisa? she wants to talk to you.
56563,Marge,my father was a stewardess.
56565,Marge,yeah... you might even say he was an american hero.
56572,Marge,oh dear.
64774,Marge,"what do you mean, this one?"
56587,Marge,"homer, you promised. one night of family time a week. besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
64780,Marge,low sodium!
64781,Marge,we killed an innocent man. we're murderers! murderers!
56590,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah two. let's get to the baby pictures."
56591,Marge,"here's bart sleeping... here he is dozing... here he is after a visit from the sandman... ooh, here's nappy-time bart... here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
56597,Marge,did you have to be so graphic?
56601,Marge,why do you say that?
64794,Marge,we're not here for rabbit. i used to live in this house as a girl.
56609,Marge,and then when i told him about lisa...
56610,Marge,"i'll stay here, but i'm gonna think about products i might like to purchase."
64807,Marge,what's so wrong with me?
64808,Marge,i remember everything.
56619,Marge,"homie, i think someone is saying hello."
56622,Marge,boy discovers comet.
56631,Marge,"say moe, was it a duck?"
64825,Marge,there we go. clean... and white... and soft.
56634,Marge,"yes, homie?"
64826,Marge,"lisa, honey, i insist. because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me."
56636,Marge,i'm not saying it won't work. i'm just saying it's dishonest.
64828,Marge,what business?
64831,Marge,homer!
56643,Marge,that's better.
64840,Marge,thank god mr. burns isn't alive to see this.
56649,Marge,c... o...
64845,Marge,"homer, are you scaring those kids?"
64846,Marge,opossum!
56656,Marge,"our countries may have their differences, but as human beings i think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent."
64851,Marge,you brickyard bimbo!
64857,Marge,are you sure?
64861,Marge,it wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
56674,Marge,what's that paper?
56676,Marge,"homer, homer why didn't you tell me?"
64869,Marge,next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house.
64873,Marge,even mac davis himself couldn't save this christmas.
64874,Marge,i'm trying! it just keeps popping off.
64875,Marge,"you can make it through this, marge. just think of homer."
56685,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, and i have an idea."
64881,Marge,martha stewart! how did you get in here?!
56690,Marge,i'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. did you know there are over six hundred critics on tv and leonard maltin is the best looking of them all?
64885,Marge,"martha, the house looks beautiful -- it's like christmas with a childless gay couple. but it's just not the same without my family being themselves."
56696,Marge,"homer, the guest should get the last pork chop."
56698,Marge,how droll.
64890,Marge,i didn't. i got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. so not a peep out of anyone till the fiesta bowl!
64893,Marge,what's going on? i called the prison and they won't tell me where homer is!
56703,Marge,you don't have to do this.
64896,Marge,sounds pretty good.
56705,Marge,fine. you're on the jury.
56706,Marge,"homer, please pay attention. there's just one more movie."
56707,Marge,all right. it's time to vote for the grand prize.
64897,Marge,why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
64898,Marge,i was afraid this day would come.
56710,Marge,i knew this would happen. i put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
56712,Marge,"homie, you voted for the right movie. i'm glad you were on the jury."
56716,Marge,"lisa!! hello! how're you doing in england? remember, an elevator is called a ""lift,"" a mile is called a ""kilometer,"" and botulism is called ""steak and kidney pie."""
64908,Marge,"i'm glad you had fun, because we're all getting together next week."
64914,Marge,thanks for the ride!
56723,Marge,homer! bart! maggie! company eating rules.
64916,Marge,just a little merloooot.
56725,Marge,"you know, fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, i didn't even notice."
56728,Marge,here.
56729,Marge,"all right, who broke my vase?!"
64921,Marge,"milhouse, i'm getting tired of waiting."
64924,Marge,"i love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, i need something for myself!"
56734,Marge,"no, no, our dog is out of control. he's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority."
64926,Marge,so bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. can you believe it?
56736,Marge,"oh, this place is so big. do you think we should split up and look for them, homie? homie?"
64927,Marge,what are you talking about?
64934,Marge,"what do you mean, wig?"
56743,Marge,"hey, what did i just say?!!"
56751,Marge,"well, it's just easier this way."
56753,Marge,"now i know we love the puppies very much, but i think they're getting to be a problem."
56756,Marge,"we've got to be realistic, kids. who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
64955,Marge,"well, what do you kids think of the real me?"
56767,Marge,that's it. we have to get them back to school.
64959,Marge,"well, thank you."
64963,Marge,"a.a.a.? no, i'm not in triple-a. i don't like their ""westways"" magazine. they'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet."
56773,Marge,i'd be thrilled. you can start right now.
64966,Marge,"he loves it! he calls me his ""silver belle!"""
56775,Marge,i hate it when he gets in there.
64969,Marge,give me a double espresso to go.
56778,Marge,"bart, are you ready for your history test?"
64972,Marge,brambles!
56786,Marge,"homer, this is a cemetery."
56791,Marge,aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
64986,Marge,"thanks, rollin' eighties."
56796,Marge,"it's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
56797,Marge,somebody stop him!
64989,Marge,go! save yourselves!
64993,Marge,"bart, why are you tugging on your collar?"
64994,Marge,"walther, when a man puts something on a frisbee, he should stand by it."
56803,Marge,"lisa, unhand your brother."
56805,Marge,"strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. i'm crossing over to deviled ham. whoa!"
64997,Marge,"homie, you know all the bits. maybe you could help him!"
65000,Marge,awww.
56809,Marge,"actually, i'm interested in becoming a police officer."
65004,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no -- i don't want the money back, i just came for my dog."
56817,Marge,no.
56820,Marge,"hello, mr. hutz."
56821,Marge,i just wanted to say hello.
65014,Marge,i can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
56823,Marge,"apu, no."
65017,Marge,but...
56827,Marge,"look, why don't you two settle down. i'm sure you can get another pillow."
65020,Marge,"ooo, they even have a zoo -- featuring all the nfl mascots!"
56830,Marge,it's for your own safety.
65022,Marge,"homer, the game is right here!"
56836,Marge,"oh. uh, a looks nice. it's a, it's a good length for you."
65031,Marge,there's one right here!
56841,Marge,i didn't mean to.
56843,Marge,"everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law. dog, no leash. man littering. horse not wearing diaper. car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
56845,Marge,"homer, i'm on duty."
65038,Marge,"look, now my son needs your help."
56847,Marge,"i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
56849,Marge,you're breaking the law.
56855,Marge,homer!
65050,Marge,what?! what? what will we eat?
56861,Marge,"years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
56862,Marge,that's it! there's too much corruption on this force. i quit!
56870,Marge,this town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...
65064,Marge,i don't think this is a good idea at all. the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu. he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
56875,Marge,"homer, come quick! bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
56877,Marge,isn't there anything we can do?
56881,Marge,holy christmas.
65074,Marge,"well, homer and i are going to take you away right now."
56888,Marge,where is everybody?
56890,Marge,the police already have a suspect. it's mr. smithers.
65082,Marge,"well... newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
56893,Marge,"grampa, i found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. have you seen it?"
56895,Marge,"were you talking to me, grampa?"
56902,Marge,"growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, bart."
65097,Marge,...and these are from sardine cans your father opened. he saved them out of sentimental value.
56908,Marge,and don't put signs on your sister.
56909,Marge,"now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. that way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry! eh? eh?"
56910,Marge,"enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
65103,Marge,uh-oh.
65108,Marge,"actually, sometimes you do push ned around."
65109,Marge,"don't do that, homie. it rubs off your side hair."
65113,Marge,he's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
56926,Marge,can you see them?
56927,Marge,that's it. we're going downtown to get our kids back. right now!
56928,Marge,"we've always tried to be good parents. please, i'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
65120,Marge,"kids, enjoy your extreme snack!"
56932,Marge,it's so quiet here without the kids.
65128,Marge,i don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
65133,Marge,how about living on a train that's always moving?
56943,Marge,"oh, maggie, you're a simpson again!"
56945,Marge,"aw, honey, you're not a monster."
56946,Marge,"hmm. bart, what's wrong? there's something a little off about your hug."
56947,Marge,"uh, uh, uh, let me guess. a mother can always tell. hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. it almost feels like you're missing something. something important."
56948,Marge,an alligator with sunglasses? now i've seen everything!
65138,Marge,come in and get some more!
65140,Marge,he had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
65141,Marge,homie... you're paralyzed. but we love you and will never give up hope.
65143,Marge,just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
56953,Marge,"i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for once. besides, i'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... god only knows."
65145,Marge,shhh. don't say a word.
65148,Marge,"patty and selma?! who's next, ned flanders?"
56957,Marge,oh my.
65150,Marge,but you're god. couldn't you make everything the way it was?
56960,Marge,"why thank you, homie. you might say the extra ingredient is salt."
56962,Marge,"bart, sensible bites! all right lisa. if you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things i can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs..."
65154,Marge,this is the most adorable thing i've ever seen in my entire life!
65155,Marge,take off the 3-d glasses!
65157,Marge,i know! i know!
65159,Marge,the jars are full -- so you've earned your... saturday surprise dad day!
56969,Marge,"homer, you're not not talking to me. and secondly, i heard what you said."
56970,Marge,homer! where did you get that?
65163,Marge,"it's not fair. moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff."
65164,Marge,what if... we roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
65165,Marge,i've got it!
65169,Marge,"i'm sorry, gang. i blew it."
65171,Marge,nowhere scary!
65174,Marge,i guess we could make a sprint for one of these local establishments.
56984,Marge,no.
65177,Marge,they're selling cds in the restaurant.
56987,Marge,"oh, homie..."
65181,Marge,what's the craziest thing on the menu?
56991,Marge,have you lost your mind?! have you thought about your health?... or your appearance?
56995,Marge,"you're right. maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice. homer? homer! homer! that's it. that's the one. all right, send him on in."
57015,Marge,"when i asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" you go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
57017,Marge,she's nice.
65209,Marge,don't you judge me.
57019,Marge,which was?
65211,Marge,um... i don't know. probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts.
65213,Marge,who am i kidding? i'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. i'm calling homer.
65224,Marge,"i know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me."
65225,Marge,i hope bart's having fun.
65226,Marge,"welcome home, handsome!"
57037,Marge,"well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
57043,Marge,"rockabye baby in the tree top / when the wind blows / the cradle will rock / when the bough breaks / the cradle will fall / and down will come baby, cradle and all."
57044,Marge,sweet dreams.
57046,Marge,"all right, climb in."
65238,Marge,"well, you certainly won't be bending me-- wait, how did i end up in your bedroom?"
57048,Marge,"don't touch those yet. they're very, very hot."
57049,Marge,they're all gone. the whole batch.
65246,Marge,don't talk to me like i'm a client!
57058,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
65251,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad you're not an accounts man anymore."
65252,Marge,"kids, that's enough tv. maggie's eye is starting to wander."
65254,Marge,we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday when it closes forever.
57063,Marge,"well, if loving my kids is ""lame,"" then i guess i'm just a big lame."
57067,Marge,ninety-nine cents!
65259,Marge,"annie, would you ever consider taking krusty back as a client?"
57069,Marge,"bart, get your suit on."
65261,Marge,"which means, it's the start of christmas season...which means..."
57071,Marge,"oh, good. so get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the try-n-save."
65263,Marge,we tried that last year!
57073,Marge,"bart, what's taking so long? if you're having that problem with your zipper, i can send your father up."
57074,Marge,what's the matter with your face? is that a fake nose? are you wearing chin putty?
65276,Marge,lisa...
57085,Marge,"oh, bart."
57087,Marge,i don't know. why don't you go to bed?
65281,Marge,i told you not to pack them!
57094,Marge,i think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
57095,Marge,i didn't think you'd mind. i figured you were getting a little too old for this. but you can still make one. there's some snow left under the car.
57096,Marge,we're almost finished. there's just a little bit of green left.
65290,Marge,"homie, i'm glad you're passionate, i just hope you're not riling people up with your show."
65292,Marge,"homie, i love you, and i'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world..."
57101,Marge,"there's no place left to run, bart. hand it over."
57108,Marge,"homie, you want pork chops?"
57109,Marge,those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
57115,Marge,ooh.
65307,Marge,i was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. better sort those out.
65314,Marge,rag soup!
57123,Marge,why don't you read something?
65315,Marge,come on in!
65316,Marge,"well, during the town meeting, which now seems like years ago, i forgot my purse at your bar...and when i came back to get it, i saw how much you love that rag."
65319,Marge,it's a beautiful afternoon. no tv.
65322,Marge,"homie, read this."
57131,Marge,no.
65324,Marge,my pleasure.
65332,Marge,"well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. now start quilting!"
65333,Marge,now there's three of you?
65339,Marge,"oh, my. i don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before."
57148,Marge,"i used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. i can show you."
65345,Marge,homie! what if that was the last thing you ever said?
57157,Marge,"well, we're not."
57158,Marge,"ohhh. i've always dreamed of coming here. everybody keep smiling, and i know we're going fit right in."
65349,Marge,"not without us, it isn't! pull over."
65354,Marge,if i may speak.
65360,Marge,"i'm trying to make the best of things, but i'm worried maggie is falling in with a bad crowd."
57175,Marge,"at times like this, i guess all you can do is laugh."
57177,Marge,"mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
57179,Marge,miss... miss! do you have a chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
65374,Marge,"now, last but not least, your present, homie."
65375,Marge,"well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good."
65380,Marge,"homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?"
65382,Marge,i can see how this show might not be to his liking.
57192,Marge,"don't worry, i saved the receipt. we'll have a $3,300 credit at chanel."
57193,Marge,"c'mon, let's go. i wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
65387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. a diaper just isn't sexy."
65388,Marge,he's a baby with wings!
57197,Marge,tacos! public broadcasting! i won't have you kids throwing your money away like that. you're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
65391,Marge,it's kind of embarrassing...
65392,Marge,how do you know about it?
65393,Marge,...so we can go inside homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
65394,Marge,why does maggie have to go?
65396,Marge,"homie, this might be a clue! what's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies!"
57216,Marge,"kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
65411,Marge,homie! you're home early!
57221,Marge,"okay. maybe everything's all right. maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. if he's alive."
57225,Marge,"well, if it's just for one more night."
65418,Marge,rum cake!
57229,Marge,umm... how about... ghostmutt?
57232,Marge,"wait, kids. you can't give up on itchy and scratchy. you're always so good at these things. why, together you've reunited krusty with his father, gotten principal skinner his job back, and helped dr. riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. you've even foiled sideshow bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
65425,Marge,"bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes."
57234,Marge,"that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
57235,Marge,what are you talking about?
57236,Marge,"homer! that's just an urban legend. people don't do that type of thing with fish. troy mcclure is a perfect gentlemen, like bing crosby or jfk. i wonder where troy is now?"
65427,Marge,"he exercises so much, but he looks the same. i guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future."
65430,Marge,it means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
57239,Marge,it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
65434,Marge,i don't think so.
57243,Marge,"i'm honored, bart. and lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with dad. you've been interested in nuclear power for years."
65441,Marge,"lisa, are you out there in your slippers? come inside!"
65443,Marge,"care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
57254,Marge,of course i'll accept! bart! i've missed you so mu-- you want to speak to lisa?
65448,Marge,homer!
57257,Marge,"hello? no, bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to amsterdam!"
57258,Marge,"homer, are you laughing at me?"
65452,Marge,we sold it to pay for a family cruise!
57263,Marge,"hmmm... maybe it needs a little mayonnaise to get going. okay, you go sit in the sun and let it melt in."
57266,Marge,but where are we going to put him?
65461,Marge,"last week that steward brought me extra shampoo... he called me ""lovely lady."""
65463,Marge,there is no virus! bart faked the whole thing with a dvd! a direct-to-video dvd!
57272,Marge,"what you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating u.s. law."
57273,Marge,"you know what? i'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
65471,Marge,just take me home.
65475,Marge,just zip it!
57303,Marge,"well, duh! with what, ned?"
57307,Marge,"oh, okay."
65501,Marge,"so, how do the boys like springfield elementary?"
57312,Marge,"because it was the only one in the house. come on, homer, open the door for your mystery date!"
65505,Marge,"ned, how did you sleep?"
57315,Marge,"gee, i don't know what you've got planned for tonight, homer, but count me out. didn't you buy any meat?"
65507,Marge,"bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
57317,Marge,"oh, you haven't said that in four years. let lisa have it."
65508,Marge,that is totally irresponsible parenting!
57321,Marge,"remember, kids, there's no need to bump! just enjoy the ride!"
57323,Marge,"homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
65518,Marge,i'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
57329,Marge,it saved our marriage!
65529,Marge,"oh, forget it."
57338,Marge,what lifelong dream?
57339,Marge,"homer, i don't want to leave springfield. i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to hoist myself out of it."
65532,Marge,la-dies-and-gen-tle-men-i-have-an-an-nounce-ment. that's not iambic pentameter!
65535,Marge,"no! for details, log onto thesimpsons.com."
53250,Ned Flanders,"well, hi-diddly..."
53254,Ned Flanders,"now, homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
53255,Ned Flanders,"oh, we're not as well-off as you think. we give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. and the leftorium's business has gone way downhill since leftopolis moved in next door."
53258,Ned Flanders,he taught us how to live a burt reynolds lifestyle on a mac davis income. we've already got tickets for his next seminar.
53272,Ned Flanders,"hear that, maude? homer's a critic."
53273,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that looks scrum-diddly-doodly-duddly --"
53287,Ned Flanders,"well, if i were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
53298,Ned Flanders,"feels like i'm wearin' nothin' at all. nothin' at all, nothin' at all..."
53306,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that smarts. boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol."
53309,Ned Flanders,"ah, yeah, i, i couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
53315,Ned Flanders,"abso-not-ly, hot roddy. we're up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers' cussing."
53320,Ned Flanders,what are you saying?
53322,Ned Flanders,"that's nice of you homer, but i think i'll just go to bed."
53323,Ned Flanders,"homer, this really isn't necessary..."
53332,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but i feel like i've turned a corner."
53335,Ned Flanders,so that's why you maced me.
53342,Ned Flanders,you think she would?
53349,Ned Flanders,"well, i just can't relate to the women of today, homer. ah, it's probably me. i'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
53352,Ned Flanders,that's right. and i may not go to church tomorrow.
53353,Ned Flanders,"no, i'm not kidding. i am gonna sit right here and miss church. you just watch."
53357,Ned Flanders,"i'll be right back, boys. i'm going to go help that lady."
53358,Ned Flanders,"uh, that was a lovely song. it really got to me."
53359,Ned Flanders,i-i recently lost my wife.
53361,Ned Flanders,"well, that, that sounds real nice, rachel, but a... i'm a... i'm not quite..."
53363,Ned Flanders,"jesus, is that you?"
53369,Ned Flanders,"actually, homer, you and i worship the same god, so..."
53370,Ned Flanders,"well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
53372,Ned Flanders,i'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that hollywood hogwash.
53376,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're busy. catch you later, compu-tater."
53391,Ned Flanders,we're trapped!
53395,Ned Flanders,now let's go save those kids.
53402,Ned Flanders,can't let this little doozy get out.
53407,Ned Flanders,ow! it's one-way!
53413,Ned Flanders,...and harry potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
53417,Ned Flanders,"i didn't have a ""crush"" on her."
53420,Ned Flanders,it says i have cooties.
53423,Ned Flanders,"oh, how horrible!"
53426,Ned Flanders,"i'd love to get together, but tomorrow i've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
53427,Ned Flanders,my place? what would the neighbors think?
53433,Ned Flanders,this should keep you toasty.
53434,Ned Flanders,"mmm... i love chenille, don't you?"
53438,Ned Flanders,"i sure appreciate you folks offering to go through maude's things. if it were up to me, i wouldn't throw anything away."
53444,Ned Flanders,here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
53447,Ned Flanders,"maude designed a christian amusement park. oh, it must have been her final dream."
53451,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been closed for so long... and-and i thought i could turn it into a christian theme park."
53465,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, i think you're beautiful."
53476,Ned Flanders,it's almost like she's alive again.
53477,Ned Flanders,"homer, no! i can't exploit a divine manifestation."
53478,Ned Flanders,"oh, there's no explaining god's will, roddy. that's like explaining how an airplane flies."
53479,Ned Flanders,leak in the line?
53481,Ned Flanders,"ah, ah, folks, i've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. you see..."
53497,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure would. it would give the boys a place to go after school."
53505,Ned Flanders,"playing a prankeroo, eh?"
53530,Ned Flanders,"well, luckily, i've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
53534,Ned Flanders,"well, okay... i, i guess it would go something like this: all right, simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
53544,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, i've been singing your praises all day. marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
53546,Ned Flanders,"well, nice work, inspector find-it. did you catch the thief?"
53551,Ned Flanders,"i don't know, neighboreenos, i'm all for halloween fun, but a séance sounds a little pg-13."
53558,Ned Flanders,"hate to be a needy neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
53567,Ned Flanders,"well, aren't you a super-duper recouper."
53581,Ned Flanders,"where you going, reverend? the town's that way. reverend? you're goin' the wrong way!"
53586,Ned Flanders,speaking in tongues. what great kids.
53587,Ned Flanders,"okay boys, this is it. the end of this sinful little suburb."
53589,Ned Flanders,"well, sea captain, looks like you and i are sailin' solo tonight."
53598,Ned Flanders,"well, it looks good... and it sounds pretty too."
53599,Ned Flanders,"a woman askin' a man out? well, well why not. and maybe i'll eat my steak with a spoon."
53604,Ned Flanders,i need your advice. it's about a lady.
53611,Ned Flanders,"yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between los angeles and new york. called america!"
53624,Ned Flanders,can i call you jim?
53629,Ned Flanders,"sara, i'm sorry, but i can't move to hollywood. heck, even dollywood's too far out for me. too many people appreciating it ironically."
53632,Ned Flanders,sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. the last thing i bought for a lady was a casket.
53640,Ned Flanders,this is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. i better talk this over with the big man.
53649,Ned Flanders,"i love you, too. and i always will. but unlike the bible, i guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
53659,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, writing a new christmas carol?"
53661,Ned Flanders,"there's a stranger in the manger and his name is love take it, homer!"
53663,Ned Flanders,"why thank you, homer. it's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
53665,Ned Flanders,"i got your letter, jesus and i'm coming as fast as i can."
53673,Ned Flanders,"well, i did finish first in the walk for the cure... of homosexuality."
53682,Ned Flanders,here come sandwiches / here come sandwiches / right down boozy bum lane...
53683,Ned Flanders,brother ned's got cheese on bread / and a side order of shame...
53689,Ned Flanders,"why, i'll give you a jump, i'll rotate your tires, i'll even fold up that map for you. i know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
53699,Ned Flanders,that is one bitchin' bike!
53700,Ned Flanders,"lighten up, roddy."
53701,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
53702,Ned Flanders,"they were two for one at krusty home depot, so i got an extra one for you guys!"
53704,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess it wouldn't kill me to let you in."
53709,Ned Flanders,"oh, and another thing..."
53715,Ned Flanders,let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the visa.
53722,Ned Flanders,well i didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
53727,Ned Flanders,"don't worry, sweetie. i am not going to kill your father."
53728,Ned Flanders,"homer, please, don't tempt the gods. i-i mean god! there's-there's one god! only one! well, sometimes there's three."
53734,Ned Flanders,but you're gonna kill us all...
53738,Ned Flanders,press... destruct... button.
53739,Ned Flanders,don't do it! don't do it! you'll kill everyone!
53740,Ned Flanders,do it! do it! kill everyone!
53745,Ned Flanders,"marge, you know i thought i was springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
53746,Ned Flanders,"you know i was gonna enter this here ovenfresh bakeoff... but up against you, i wouldn't have a hindu's chance in heaven."
53752,Ned Flanders,i was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
53755,Ned Flanders,why don't you just call out for hawk man?
53773,Ned Flanders,but who'd know the difference?
53775,Ned Flanders,"yeah. i made a great film, but i'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. i'm like michael moore, except i'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and god loves me. i just wish i could find some way to spread my message."
53783,Ned Flanders,i was wrong!
53786,Ned Flanders,"uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
53788,Ned Flanders,"howdy, homer. you here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
53797,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't take money from a neighbor. although, business at the leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
53800,Ned Flanders,"wait, this is my license!"
53806,Ned Flanders,that's odd.
53820,Ned Flanders,"boys, we're home!"
53822,Ned Flanders,can i start yesterday?
53826,Ned Flanders,homer? what are you doing here?
53838,Ned Flanders,"marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council. to stuckey's!"
53840,Ned Flanders,"oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. like the jews with their snippity-snip."
53844,Ned Flanders,it's seven a.m. what are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
53858,Ned Flanders,aagh! paper cut!
53865,Ned Flanders,"well sir, we could do a little quid pro for the kay-pro. the left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of springfield's largest southpaw shop, i just gotta be there. could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
53873,Ned Flanders,"hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
53877,Ned Flanders,what's this?
53892,Ned Flanders,"rod... you can do it, boy! with god on your side, you can't fail!"
53893,Ned Flanders,evolution?!
53899,Ned Flanders,"wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there homer..."
53900,Ned Flanders,"oh, fine. take the cut."
53904,Ned Flanders,my most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
53911,Ned Flanders,as familiar as it's proper to be.
53914,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm tryin' to..."
53918,Ned Flanders,"well, i wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, lisa."
53921,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!"
53927,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've never seen you like this before."
53929,Ned Flanders,"start 'er up, boys!"
53940,Ned Flanders,"okay, ""smallville""... super dog licks himself. that definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
53942,Ned Flanders,and now to peruse the local news!
53947,Ned Flanders,hey homer!
53953,Ned Flanders,perhaps i can be of some assistance.
53965,Ned Flanders,and the rest!
53971,Ned Flanders,"that concludes our halloween show for this year. i just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to hell. and that includes fx, fox sports and our newest devil's portal, the wall street journal! welcome to the club!"
53977,Ned Flanders,"they're outlaws?! i've been played like a pair of spoons! well, who am i to judge -- it's the depression, money's tight..."
53983,Ned Flanders,"as the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. i spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these hardy boys books."
53985,Ned Flanders,"ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- i don't think so."
53986,Ned Flanders,ow! what was that for?
53987,Ned Flanders,zippin' it up!
53997,Ned Flanders,now i can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
54003,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. and also, thank you for my partner homer, who..."
54006,Ned Flanders,our first bail jumper!
54018,Ned Flanders,"homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! you need a special sticker just to bring a bike! have you no respect for the law?"
54020,Ned Flanders,this partnership is over!
54026,Ned Flanders,"i'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me."
54028,Ned Flanders,i figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at lisa's recital.
54033,Ned Flanders,"thanks, but... what are you holding on to?"
54035,Ned Flanders,...abraham became the father of isaac. isaac became the father of jacob. jacob became the father of judah and his brothers. judah became the father of perez and zerah by tamar.
54036,Ned Flanders,perez became the father of hezron. hezron became the father of ram.
54040,Ned Flanders,"put 'er there, muddy buddy."
54047,Ned Flanders,that's just your trouser devil talking!
54052,Ned Flanders,so... i'm sure you missed marge last night.
54058,Ned Flanders,"as the worm said to the plate of spaghetti, ""i... i..."
54066,Ned Flanders,"well, actually... as your landlord, repairs are my responsibility. i'll just get my tools..."
54067,Ned Flanders,"try 'er now, marge."
54073,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm sorry, i just had my glass of warm milk which means i am closed for business!"
54080,Ned Flanders,wha? who's that?
54083,Ned Flanders,"you two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, christian but not baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
54091,Ned Flanders,it's okay if you backslide a little.
54100,Ned Flanders,"reverend, care for some of my devils food cake?"
54103,Ned Flanders,diddily...
54105,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
54108,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. i found out rod watched a commercial for ""grey's anatomy,"" and todd took a full day to tell me."
54109,Ned Flanders,what's the next task on the old i-dinnerary?
54110,Ned Flanders,saved by the bell from eternity in hell!
54117,Ned Flanders,and she's teleconferencing the devil using that computer from hell!
54120,Ned Flanders,seen the paper?
54122,Ned Flanders,"you know marge, maude and i had a fight right before she died..."
54127,Ned Flanders,"now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""welcome to bible study!"""
54131,Ned Flanders,"mouse pad! double click! skyyype! uh, skyyype! matthew twenty-three: ""then spake jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
54132,Ned Flanders,i'll handle this.
54134,Ned Flanders,...man i ever met!
54135,Ned Flanders,that man is beyond redemption!
54151,Ned Flanders,"yes, but it means more to you."
54155,Ned Flanders,"and lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. and thank you, again, for the challenge of homer simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. me homer, you the cross. and now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
54160,Ned Flanders,you come all the way to jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
54165,Ned Flanders,"it's because i believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. at least i thought so till now. homer simpson, you are not worth saving."
54168,Ned Flanders,"ooo, looks like a sandstorm's brewin'. i'll just wait it out at a movie."
54175,Ned Flanders,"homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
54181,Ned Flanders,"isn't this great, marge? we're like jiminy cricket for the whole ding-dang town. a half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. um-hm."
54184,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
54187,Ned Flanders,less radical... less radical!
54192,Ned Flanders,"inspiration point looks pretty uninspired... all's quiet in murder town... yep, springfield is cleaner than the lord's hand towels."
54193,Ned Flanders,"sour ball, take me away!"
54201,Ned Flanders,i guess i did create this... like god created the devil.
54203,Ned Flanders,that's the worst sin of all for some reason! what can i do to make things right?
54211,Ned Flanders,"yup, that's exactly... oh, you almost got me."
54214,Ned Flanders,"indeedily-doodily i do, and i love him just as much as you! it's a flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
54217,Ned Flanders,"excuse me! with all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
54226,Ned Flanders,"actually, it's kind of cute. you look like posh spice."
54228,Ned Flanders,"it wasn't me, boys! it was the train!"
54232,Ned Flanders,"okay, ms. krabappel, what made you topple?"
54233,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm a truthful kinda guy."
54234,Ned Flanders,"so, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""flanders arms."""
54239,Ned Flanders,"besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... the leftorium. we've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
54241,Ned Flanders,"oh boy, that laugh is infectious. ha!... ha!... that's fun!"
54243,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i guess i better refenestrate ya."
54244,Ned Flanders,any chance i could see you again?
54245,Ned Flanders,"whoa, slow down. i never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
54252,Ned Flanders,"that's right, i'm down to my wife-blesser."
54255,Ned Flanders,actually... she sort of does.
54259,Ned Flanders,oh my.
54263,Ned Flanders,"that's right. and like any man, i put on my secret christian underpants one leg at a time."
54264,Ned Flanders,you all know edna?
54267,Ned Flanders,"well homer, you really put one over on old stupid flanders, here. thanks a lot, neighbor."
54269,Ned Flanders,oh i was just wondering how many boxes of staples i should order for the store. does ten sound like a lot to you? twenty? fifty? what does sound like a lot to you?
54289,Ned Flanders,homer simpson!
54292,Ned Flanders,because of you i'm going to hell!
54295,Ned Flanders,"but, but..."
54301,Ned Flanders,"it is! but if you've got the stones, i can tell you how to slay that gal-ioth."
54304,Ned Flanders,peace be with you.
54306,Ned Flanders,and i haven't. not until now.
54307,Ned Flanders,"oh that's nice, but i don't approve of--"
54308,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the ""cross"" games, simpsons! a christian fellowship expo!"
54309,Ned Flanders,"oh no, ""games"" stands for gathering of american messengers for evangelical sports!"
54315,Ned Flanders,"hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way i write."
54316,Ned Flanders,that's just fine as long as you're not a mormon!
54318,Ned Flanders,make way for captain coolerhead!
54319,Ned Flanders,"now, i like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but i do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
54325,Ned Flanders,but-but-but...
54337,Ned Flanders,'cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
54345,Ned Flanders,you pulled the boys out of school?!
54347,Ned Flanders,"well, that's just great, boys. now, come over here so mrs. simpson can take a photo."
54348,Ned Flanders,what if we were raptured right now?
54350,Ned Flanders,"you get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy rod sneakers that light up like times square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! now, just when do i get a say in how my boys are raised?! this marriage isn't perfect!"
54356,Ned Flanders,"hey, the simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. what do you say, sweetie?"
54364,Ned Flanders,"joke's on you, i needed a trim!"
54372,Ned Flanders,"oh, i will! till i go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! but come outside and see the miracle!"
54373,Ned Flanders,"no, it's still where you buried it."
54378,Ned Flanders,"to be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief."
54381,Ned Flanders,"hey, neighbor, your welcome mat's lookin' a little dusty."
54386,Ned Flanders,sure!
54390,Ned Flanders,"homer, you know my parents, capri and nedward."
54396,Ned Flanders,that's cross-legged music!
54406,Ned Flanders,better not take a full dose.
54413,Ned Flanders,homer. homer! i found the answer!
54414,Ned Flanders,"""life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
54417,Ned Flanders,"jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!"
54424,Ned Flanders,now you're rhyming?!
54425,Ned Flanders,"come on, people! you're safe as sunday with me. i wouldn't hurt a fly!"
54429,Ned Flanders,now you can shatter my orbital bone! that'll knock the wax off my candle!
54430,Ned Flanders,edna!
54443,Ned Flanders,"reverend, we want you to come back."
54449,Ned Flanders,i'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
54452,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpsons! don't mean to be a pesto, but i'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
54462,Ned Flanders,"actually, half a kiosk. sharing it with nasreen here."
54467,Ned Flanders,teen abstinence counseling! you get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their john han-bleeps.
54471,Ned Flanders,okay.
54479,Ned Flanders,the therapy bears! look out for the therapy bears!
54483,Ned Flanders,why that's a higher power than even i believe in. what is going on?
54487,Ned Flanders,"right next to mount fu-gee, i'm glad to see ya!"
54488,Ned Flanders,"well, i felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
54493,Ned Flanders,sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. are you just buying this to be nice?
54495,Ned Flanders,"well that curled my lashes, but good for you."
54508,Ned Flanders,you bet.
54509,Ned Flanders,"how do you like my new wheels, simpson?"
54510,Ned Flanders,yes indeedilly-doodily.
54511,Ned Flanders,"simple, simpson. credit."
54517,Ned Flanders,"couldn't help overhearing, simpson. i've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
54519,Ned Flanders,"there's my little popcorn ball. kissy, kissy."
54521,Ned Flanders,"oh, your beer. uh, is draft okay? just put in the tap last week."
54527,Ned Flanders,"simpson, i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to leave. i hope you understand."
54531,Ned Flanders,"hello, reverend lovejoy."
54540,Ned Flanders,"say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?"
54545,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpson."
54551,Ned Flanders,"no, i just --"
54554,Ned Flanders,"you have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!"
54555,Ned Flanders,"eh, eh, just a minute. ""loser"" is such a harsh word. couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
54558,Ned Flanders,"actually, simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt."
54560,Ned Flanders,'fraid so.
54561,Ned Flanders,'fraid so.
54571,Ned Flanders,my son... my son.
54572,Ned Flanders,"simpson, what a pleasant surprise. we were just pulling taffy."
54580,Ned Flanders,"hey, you easy. now, get off my property! off!"
52533,Ned Flanders,"au contraire, simpson! it has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
52534,Ned Flanders,"why, homer simpson! here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
54581,Ned Flanders,"ohhh. i wanted to subscribe to that new arts and crafts channel. well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? he offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
54582,Ned Flanders,"you know, that's exactly what i --"
52539,Ned Flanders,fee fi fo fum! i smell the potatoes au gratin of marge simp-son! mmmm- mmm!
52547,Ned Flanders,"so homer, i'm dyin' to know. what do you think of the leftorium?"
52549,Ned Flanders,"oh, no. the springfield mall."
52557,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, oh, i expect things to start picking up soon. i think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
52561,Ned Flanders,are you sure you're not interested? two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
52575,Ned Flanders,"you know at times like these, i-i used to turn to the bible and find solace. but even the good book can't help me now."
52579,Ned Flanders,"no! you tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... i didn't listen. homer, you were a true friend."
52583,Ned Flanders,"yes, sir!"
52590,Ned Flanders,three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents.
52592,Ned Flanders,"well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
52595,Ned Flanders,"well, you knew i had a temper when you married me."
52598,Ned Flanders,where in the bible?
52601,Ned Flanders,"he's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
52607,Ned Flanders,what?
52634,Ned Flanders,"homer, christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. hey, dig this."
52639,Ned Flanders,o-kay.
52645,Ned Flanders,"why, sue dokes, you rascal! i thought you were dead and--"
52653,Ned Flanders,"if you need anything, just give a whistle."

52672,Ned Flanders,it's been four thousand days since my last drink. it was my first and last blackberry schnapps.
52675,Ned Flanders,"hi-ho pagans! new years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
52680,Ned Flanders,"i wish he were, rod, i pray for the day, but i'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
52685,Ned Flanders,"no, ned flanders."
52687,Ned Flanders,"well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
52688,Ned Flanders,hey!

52703,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, bart!"
52705,Ned Flanders,hello? hello? hellodilly-odilly?
52718,Ned Flanders,"sorry, but i'm afraid ernest borgnine has already been confirmed."
52722,Ned Flanders,now what happened to that gosh darn map i brought?
52728,Ned Flanders,"again? homer, we have to ration the water carefully. it's our only hope."
52731,Ned Flanders,"come back! come back! oh, we're done for! we're done for! we're done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."

52756,Ned Flanders,"stan, tell you what -- homer simpson here is just about the biggest atom fan that's ever graced god's green earth. i bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
52757,Ned Flanders,"ooo, i guess it's time for me to duck again."
52759,Ned Flanders,"uh, be careful there, homer. that is sort of a new table."
52761,Ned Flanders,sure didilly do. over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
52763,Ned Flanders,"...bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
52768,Ned Flanders,"how are my boys doin', homer?"
52769,Ned Flanders,"eh, well sir. my entire family is very touched and--"
52771,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't know..."

52793,Ned Flanders,now i know everybody's eager to get back to class --
52797,Ned Flanders,"bart, i've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. and now that i have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
52799,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, were you drinking slice or yoo-hoo?"
52803,Ned Flanders,"well, i really enjoyed my time here, superintendent. may the lord bless and keep you."
52810,Ned Flanders,i wish there was some other explanation for this. but there isn't. i'm a murderer! i'm a murderer!
52813,Ned Flanders,soon enough.
52828,Ned Flanders,"hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. what can i do you for?"
52836,Ned Flanders,"i might go mad with fear out there, so todd, i want you to shoot daddy if he tries to get back in."
52839,Ned Flanders,"que sera, sera / whatever will be, will be..."
52846,Ned Flanders,"flanders to god, flanders to god! get off your cloud and save my todd."
52858,Ned Flanders,oh.
52862,Ned Flanders,"okay, okay folks, look. i called the police captain in shelbyville. he says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
52864,Ned Flanders,"well, a friendly springfield hello there, neighbors. i, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
52873,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess a little television won't hurt. i used to let the boys watch ""my three sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
52882,Ned Flanders,"well, children, it's saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play bombardment..."
52885,Ned Flanders,vulgate it is.
52887,Ned Flanders,righty-o!
52891,Ned Flanders,jes... ? jes... ? don't you kids know anything? the serpent of rehaboam? the well of zohassadar? the bridal feast of beth chadruharazzeb?
52892,Ned Flanders,"no, that ain't gonna do it."
52901,Ned Flanders,"oh, fair enough."
52907,Ned Flanders,"congratulations, homer. your q is a huge success. a toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
52916,Ned Flanders,"oh, marge. of course homer's alive. he's alive in all our hearts."
52919,Ned Flanders,"well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at table glick. like this..."
52920,Ned Flanders,"what the heckaroonie is this, mrs. glick?"
52925,Ned Flanders,"howdily-doodily there, president bush--or should i say president neighbor! i'm ned flanders, and this is maude, rod and todd."

52943,Ned Flanders,maude? boys? come on up! we're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
52954,Ned Flanders,"well, if god didn't make little green apples -- it's homer simpson! how long have you been here?"
52959,Ned Flanders,"oh, my. i better get you some cider."
52965,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
52971,Ned Flanders,howdilly-dood...

52986,Ned Flanders,"but reverend, i need to know. is god punishing me?"
52987,Ned Flanders,"even in my darkest hour, i can turn to the good book for..."
52988,Ned Flanders,son of a gun-diddily-un! those gilded edges smart!
52992,Ned Flanders,it's a miracle!
52997,Ned Flanders,"well, i've seen about enough."
53001,Ned Flanders,do i hear the sound of butting in? it's gotta be little lisa simpson -- springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
53011,Ned Flanders,"oh, sure. i was a good little boy."
53023,Ned Flanders,"oh, they hum like angels. you're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
53026,Ned Flanders,"and if you really tick me off, i'm gonna run you down with my car!"
53027,Ned Flanders,um-hm.
53032,Ned Flanders,"uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
53040,Ned Flanders,"well, what do you say, homer? can lisa babysit for my kids?"
53045,Ned Flanders,i'm meek... but i could probably stand to be meeker.
53057,Ned Flanders,help! what do i do?!
53058,Ned Flanders,tell maude i want a fancy funeral. big coffin. lotsa jewels.
53068,Ned Flanders,"oof! okay, nelson's our quarterback."
53069,Ned Flanders,"ralph, you'll be on special teams."
53081,Ned Flanders,"they're just words, neddie. words can't hurt ya."
53092,Ned Flanders,"science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. well, i say there are some things we don't want to know! important things!"
53101,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm just gonna spill my guts: i love it to death! i'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
53104,Ned Flanders,that's good enough for me.
53105,Ned Flanders,purple drapes! all my life i've wanted purple drapes!
53109,Ned Flanders,"so long, simpsons!"
53112,Ned Flanders,"ahh, of course! this must be where he dropped the dagger. and this is the butler's pantry where mrs. astor concealed herself. and right here's where they found the torso heap! in front of our very own fireplace!"
53120,Ned Flanders,"hey, i made some rice krispy squares for our hungry deprogramerinos!"
53121,Ned Flanders,"well, this is my rumpus room."
53124,Ned Flanders,"you know, i pride myself on being a good host, so i'm obliged to offer you a beer. but i'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
53128,Ned Flanders,"yes indeedy. makin' some good scratch, too."
53130,Ned Flanders,"it says ""show me your tie."" it's cute. c'mon, let's go."
53133,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, why, everything! policemen, trees, sunshine. and let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', god bless 'em."

53150,Ned Flanders,"hey, here come the simpsons. n-now be careful, homer. there's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
53160,Ned Flanders,"and, of course, i resist all the major urges."
53173,Ned Flanders,so what about all this meat?
53186,Ned Flanders,"oh, when i wanna laugh, i'll take bob saget, thank you very much."
53190,Ned Flanders,"oh, i got a bunch, homer, but i just don't feel right ab... oh, lord, what should i do?"
53195,Ned Flanders,you threw it out the...
53200,Ned Flanders,"oh, i did it! i conquered my fears and i made up for a lot of lost livin'. and i owe it all to the homer simpson program."
53201,Ned Flanders,here comes that vomit again.
53202,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm, i'm workin' on that."
53203,Ned Flanders,i okeley dokely shmokely do!
53204,Ned Flanders,"homer! the bad news, ladies, is we already have wives."
53211,Ned Flanders,oh no!
53220,Ned Flanders,"well, not, not my cup of..."
53221,Ned Flanders,i can't believe it. we're actually in the winning locker room!
53224,Ned Flanders,"you know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
53227,Ned Flanders,not so deep the lord can't find him... and judge him.
53230,Ned Flanders,"oh adam, you're too kind."
53237,Ned Flanders,"eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit?"
32772,Homer,"because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. but you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!"
32775,Homer,"come on out, boy."
32776,Homer,"y'ello. she what?! oh, my god! well i'm gonna settle this once and for all! meet me at the place we discussed."
32780,Homer,"see? now go, boy!"
32785,Homer,no!
32787,Homer,"come on, preen harder! make them hate you! you feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!"
32798,Homer,"boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
32807,Homer,what?
32808,Homer,lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. why can't i leave for thirty years?
32813,Homer,"marge, my fringes are knotted again."
32819,Homer,"yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
32825,Homer,bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
32828,Homer,you guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.
32842,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
32843,Homer,"moleman! come here, ya big bag-a skin! how the hell are ya, huh?!"
32844,Homer,"yeah? no kidding? well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun."
32847,Homer,"what, i'm going for a shia labeouf thing. not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... shia labeouf!"
32849,Homer,"stupid charities, they think i'm gonna give them money? save the children? save your breath. take a hike, sierra club! doctors without borders? doctors without money! hey, greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! robert redford? guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
32857,Homer,what?
32863,Homer,quirky? quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! you made us look like monsters!
32865,Homer,"not if i can help it! c'mere, beams! come on! hey, hey, where you going? oh, there's too many!"
32878,Homer,that's where the food sleeps!
32880,Homer,why would a robber make pie?
32882,Homer,mom!
32896,Homer,are you asleep?
32902,Homer,she said i didn't suck?
32905,Homer,"apu, what do you think happens after you die?"
32912,Homer,i've gotta get out of here!
32915,Homer,"i'm really glad you corrected me, lisa. people are always really glad when they're corrected."
32918,Homer,"i always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
32924,Homer,"three o'clock. goodbye, mom. you're finally free."
32925,Homer,"wait a minute... mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. mom! you used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
32929,Homer,show me the law that says i can't! wheee!
32936,Homer,toss it down!
32940,Homer,"that'll do, brick, that'll do."
32941,Homer,now i'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
32944,Homer,bart's having girl trouble. you better go talk to him.
32950,Homer,do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
32965,Homer,"you got it, boy."
32967,Homer,three-peat.
32968,Homer,i make that in a year.
32970,Homer,what a great job. and i could use a job right now.
32973,Homer,"now, are you gonna come quietly, or do i have to..."
32974,Homer,"now, let's think about this. if you shoot me, i won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. but someone may come after you. probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. what i'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
32980,Homer,he hands a greeting card to ned.
32982,Homer,it's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
32984,Homer,"we should be bounty hunters together. you're kind and smart, i'm cruel and strong. together, we're nothing. but together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
32986,Homer,and you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
32989,Homer,no problem.
32994,Homer,point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
33002,Homer,still on the fence.
33009,Homer,"you've got to roll it from the point. here, let me show you."
33010,Homer,now let it unfurl in your stomach.
33012,Homer,there's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
33014,Homer,"oh, wait. i left a sandwich in there."
33018,Homer,"i can't believe flanders dumped me. marge, do we have any more of your extra-long twinkies?"
33019,Homer,"marge, what's going on?"
33024,Homer,and how did you know i wouldn't be there?
33030,Homer,"so, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
33033,Homer,phew. now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
33041,Homer,"hey, he went into a construction site!"
33044,Homer,no problem.
33047,Homer,"bart! where are you, boy?! don't worry, i won't strangle you."
33048,Homer,"absolutely -- that unpleasantness in ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds."
33051,Homer,"oh, uh, she's uh..."
33059,Homer,bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
33065,Homer,"lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals..."
33075,Homer,"for your information, the ""daily growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
33076,Homer,"how's the war going? we're winning, that's great! and our standing abroad? fantastic!"
33078,Homer,"thank you, future bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!"
33086,Homer,i'll be anything and everything you want! don't leave me here with them!
33088,Homer,were we ever that stupid?
33095,Homer,"then i now pronounce us ""just dating."""
33096,Homer,i love kissing you. i never want to knock it off.
33111,Homer,"well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you."
33113,Homer,"limbo? you mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? either way, i'm in."
33127,Homer,"he's not talking, he's yelling!"
33128,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but... stupid flanders."
33133,Homer,i want you to be marge.
33136,Homer,"marge, what are you doing here?"
33137,Homer,"you better not be! i mean, great! we both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. right?"
33139,Homer,i feel the same way about that lamp.
33144,Homer,kids?!
33149,Homer,"ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
33150,Homer,i wish i'd never met you!
33152,Homer,forever? that would be awesome.
33154,Homer,"marge, when i'm with you, i get that feeling like when i got that smart kid's report card by mistake. for a minute, i thought i had all a's. and that my name was howard simberg."
33158,Homer,4 ever. i couldn't even keep a promise i made to a tree. maybe it's not too late! maybe i can still save our love. if i just show her that carving...
33159,Homer,saving our marriage!
33164,Homer,awww.
33167,Homer,but we're married.
33169,Homer,woo-hoo! adult situations!
33175,Homer,"hey moe, gimme a--"
33179,Homer,yeah.
33181,Homer,"exactly. you're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?"
33182,Homer,"oh, i'm afraid lenny's dead."
33183,Homer,and you will again. because he isn't really dead. and now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
33186,Homer,"uh-huh, got it. marge, i'm going to a hardcore gay club, and i won't be home till three in the morning!"
33190,Homer,"sweet conclusions break-up service. oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented tenderdump system."
33191,Homer,i'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!
33192,Homer,"marge, if i had a hundred dollars for every customer i'd broken up, i'd have exactly this amount. 'cause that's what i charge!"
33194,Homer,who are you?
33197,Homer,surely some holds are barred.
33198,Homer,"well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. now if you'll excuse me..."
33199,Homer,"hey, what's going on?"
33205,Homer,"and when you win, i win. i'll explain that to you on your deathbed."
33214,Homer,uh... the sun did that.
33215,Homer,"well, sweetie, daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. you'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. i hope you're not mad."
33217,Homer,you sure you're not mad?
33219,Homer,she's gone. can you drive me home? i'm a little drunk.
33244,Homer,why don't i get us dessert?
33245,Homer,i made us a little cake.
33253,Homer,i am sorry i suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. i hope we can move past this and...
33256,Homer,marge! i was right! everybody is whatever i think they are.
33258,Homer,"all right, sweetie. but if i wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
33262,Homer,the power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
33266,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait... i read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. is that true?"
33267,Homer,praise be oliver.
33268,Homer,we'll look it up in the corona.
33271,Homer,"oh, look at that. we're out of almond paste. don't get up. i'll grind the almonds myself."
33273,Homer,i'm in!
33275,Homer,they're gonna blow it up!
33279,Homer,run for your lives!
33281,Homer,uh... stay where you are!
33286,Homer,did we really need a bridge there?
33298,Homer,animals can get sick?!
33310,Homer,huh? but how are we supposed to combine the dna of two strains of the same species?
33320,Homer,"don't worry, lisa. where else are they gonna go?"
33326,Homer,"okay, honey. if it's that important to you, you said it."
33329,Homer,we... i... you come up with an excuse!
33331,Homer,"if you'll show me to your bathroom, i'd like to pretend to wash my hands."
33335,Homer,what a racket.
33336,Homer,"well, that's bart for ya."
33346,Homer,"no, he's ten days younger."
33347,Homer,if he's lucky.
33350,Homer,"if i had won class president, i'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
33351,Homer,"yup -- back in high school, right before i met your mother. a simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation..."
33360,Homer,i'll just stick with my beer.
33367,Homer,lenny! wake up!
33368,Homer,that's not why i'm here. get dressed.
33369,Homer,california casual.
33370,Homer,the ballot box?!
33379,Homer,"that's exactly what it means. and dondelinger took that life away from me. and the taking of a life is murder. and the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but i'm gonna find dondelinger and tell him i know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
33381,Homer,"dondelinger! i should have been class president, but you stole the election from me."
33388,Homer,huh? who said that?
33404,Homer,"thank you, mysterious weirdo."
33405,Homer,i'm class president.
33407,Homer,"honey, i'm home! where are the kids?"
33413,Homer,"oh, come on! that millionaire playboy? he's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the wayne foundation."
33414,Homer,"oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce."
33426,Homer,you're the government's problem now!
33441,Homer,oh no you don't!
33448,Homer,"okay, i just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds."
33451,Homer,"oh, mr. burns! why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
33452,Homer,"so, plans for the weekend?"
33453,Homer,"marge, are you mad i forgot to send in the payment?"
33455,Homer,oh mardi gras / oh mardi gras / you see a lot of boo-bies...
33458,Homer,this counts as that.
33461,Homer,"marge, lighten up. even grampa's enjoying himself."
33468,Homer,"beads, please."
33478,Homer,and it was gooood.
33482,Homer,next problem.
33484,Homer,"i'm back, baby!"
33489,Homer,"oh, right -- like ""dateline"" did to you!"
33493,Homer,...squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...
33495,Homer,why you little...
33498,Homer,fine. you're mad. what are you gonna do about it?
33500,Homer,"flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on christmas, would you?"
33517,Homer,"honey, don't cry. it could be worse -- at least it's not raining!"
33519,Homer,"kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy."
33520,Homer,that's not true. you have bug bites you can scratch.
33521,Homer,"oh, flanders, i promise i'll never abuse our friendship again."
33524,Homer,"yeah, right! and i'm married to wonder woman!"
33525,Homer,"no, i'm gonna see it first!"
33526,Homer,my space toy!
33527,Homer,we'll be talking about this together for years!
33538,Homer,not in front of the poison man!
33544,Homer,"let's see: i need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but i can only take one thing at a time. i can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and i can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
33547,Homer,yo! over here!
33557,Homer,"come on, lady, have a heart. i screwed up! i'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!"
33560,Homer,told you there was no way i would do it.
33562,Homer,huh?
33565,Homer,"no, marge. you're the most giving person i know. besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne."
33566,Homer,"you told me something, but i wasn't listening!"
33568,Homer,mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
33569,Homer,"that was good, but lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
33578,Homer,interesting proposal. now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
33581,Homer,"hey, what happened to the bubbles?"
33583,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?"
33593,Homer,"hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? how about you, greensleeves? irishmen love to get drunk."
33606,Homer,"moe, you were right!"
33607,Homer,"well, ""da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""
33609,Homer,"don't worry, dad. we'll get out. america is the new york yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
33616,Homer,"reverend lovejoy? you deliver pizza now? but we didn't order a pizza. but you forgot the pizza anyway. marge, the pizza place screwed up again."
33617,Homer,"you don't get it, padre. my old lady and i have a thing goin' on. we don't need a piece of paper to keep it real."
33619,Homer,why you little bastard...
33622,Homer,"hello. it's me, lance romance."
33624,Homer,"marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. so -- will you marry me -- in style?"
33627,Homer,"check out this rocket ship cake, marge."
33633,Homer,"marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. i think you're becoming a... bridezilla."
33639,Homer,"just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
33640,Homer,i miss you so much.
33641,Homer,"you idiot! how am i ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
33642,Homer,"to get the key i have to lick through a lollipop? oh, how awful."
33646,Homer,"i'm gonna say this for the last time: bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
33653,Homer,"i'm not sure what happened. i was kidnapped, then tortured, then i fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. when i awoke, i felt refreshed. then i was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn."
33656,Homer,a rocket ship wedding cake -- just what i always wanted!
33658,Homer,"this is no time to pat the bunny, maggie. daddy's watching a very important mid-atlantic hockey league conference semi-final do-over game."
33663,Homer,i will never... know... the score!
33667,Homer,he is pretty good with her.
33668,Homer,look marge! it's just what you want. me spending the day with muggsy.
33672,Homer,"this is it, maggie -- the place where daddy goes every morning."
33673,Homer,"now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
33677,Homer,hello maggie... hello maggie.
33682,Homer,aww. innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. how sweet. maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
33685,Homer,"pleased to meet you. uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but i have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that i can't help wondering about."
33688,Homer,"here we are, maggie. that park you love..."
33689,Homer,see you when the moon comes out.
33693,Homer,now what?
33696,Homer,"whatcha watchin', honey?"
33700,Homer,"well, i'm glad they suspended milhouse. he's a bad influence on you."
33713,Homer,'ut 'uz it 'ay?
33714,Homer,"oh man, i love saturdays!"
33717,Homer,"ooh, chicken-kebab!"
33718,Homer,"ooh, fire-kebab!"
33719,Homer,water!
33722,Homer,is it 'omplimentawee?
33731,Homer,ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
33742,Homer,sure is hot back here.
33745,Homer,"buddy, i'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation."
33746,Homer,"well, i know when i'm not wanted. am i wanted?"
33752,Homer,"i don't have to ""helicopter"" bart -- i've got a backup plan called ""lisa."""
33761,Homer,there's no future in that!
33764,Homer,too obvious.
33767,Homer,perfect!
33769,Homer,black hawk down! black hawk down!
33777,Homer,"and that, my dear girl, is called the toledo take-back."
33783,Homer,what's the hardest model there is?
33787,Homer,"but first, as part of ""operation popularity,"" lisa and i are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
33794,Homer,all the other parents are doing it for their kids. now stand back and i'll take it from here. a little further back.
33798,Homer,geoffrey chaucer?! what are you doing here?
33808,Homer,i h-8 this?
33812,Homer,"i tried to fix the kids' lives, but instead i led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own."
33813,Homer,that mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
33814,Homer,it was stuffed with cash!
33826,Homer,tempting. tempting. where's the bathroom?
33839,Homer,"well, i love to play, but i'm not very good. also, i always forget to cash my chips back in for money."
33841,Homer,your hair smells nice!
33849,Homer,i was an astronaut for a little bit. so many rules.
33850,Homer,listen... i got a place down the hall.
33852,Homer,we're not the only ones having a good time.
33863,Homer,sometimes i think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
33865,Homer,"but, i thought... you said..."
33867,Homer,why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
33868,Homer,"what do you think, marge? maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
33872,Homer,"thanks, marge. but don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit."
33875,Homer,you're not suggesting... murder.
33885,Homer,who the hell is banquo?
33887,Homer,that's inspiring. what's that from? x-men 2?
33889,Homer,why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
33894,Homer,"well, at least you can't nag me anymore."
33897,Homer,"to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. and all our yesterdays have lighted fools. the way to dusty death. out, out, brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. that struts and frets his hour upon the stage. and then is heard no more."
33898,Homer,me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
33914,Homer,because i'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
33920,Homer,"ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit."
33923,Homer,found this on the roof.
33937,Homer,oh marge! i'm ready for some lovin'!
33938,Homer,"marge, speak to me."
33944,Homer,what happened is you left! who did you leave me for? tell me. i can take it.
33945,Homer,i knew it!
33948,Homer,you just said both those things to me.
33953,Homer,it will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
33954,Homer,"i said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
33958,Homer,"when you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
33985,Homer,"well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night."
33998,Homer,you mean tell her i love her? or i meaning you?
34001,Homer,to the panic room!
34002,Homer,to the panic room store!
34005,Homer,"well, well, well."
34007,Homer,got your nose.
34015,Homer,i'd like to try most every guy / from here to timbuk-tee
34026,Homer,yeah!
34031,Homer,"oh, well... i didn't know that."
34046,Homer,we're gonna be snore in the morning...
34049,Homer,"actually, those were carl's shirts."
34051,Homer,"okay, fission week kicks off on monday with a reception by the international proton council. word is, protons are the new electrons."
34059,Homer,"if you fire me, i'll call president sarkozy and he'll be all over you like truffaut on hitchcock."
34061,Homer,oh wouldn't i? just listen.
34073,Homer,"finally, some peace and quiet."
34083,Homer,"mmm, not bad."
34090,Homer,back to the horses! back to the horses!
34091,Homer,"gee lisa, looks like tomorrow i'll be shoveling ten feet of ""global warming."""
34092,Homer,"i see. so you're saying ""warming"" makes it colder. well, aren't you the queen of crazyland? everything's the opposite of everything. la-de-da-de-da! i'm lisa simpson. la-de-da-de-da."
34099,Homer,there comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. do we eat dessert or do we make love?
34101,Homer,we couldn't do both.
34105,Homer,and turn that upside down...
34121,Homer,"hurry! if we don't get a seat in the splash zone, i've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!"
34125,Homer,wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
34129,Homer,how come grampa never shares those stories with us?
34134,Homer,"what the?! well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
34141,Homer,"why you little... oh, i can't. when i look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
34146,Homer,isn't that cute? he thinks he's a pack.
34152,Homer,a little lower... a little lower...
34153,Homer,how can you stand up to this punishment?
34158,Homer,"fortunately there was one man who could help: colonel tom parker. the colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""the rolling stones."" the first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. but those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."
34160,Homer,"aw c'mon, marge. there's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head."
34162,Homer,"none for me, marge. i get free donuts at work! i can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits..."
34163,Homer,"...groaning with a ""united nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."
34168,Homer,i guess these days headhunters can be anything.
34174,Homer,"goodbye, power plant. i'd better get out of here before i have a meltdown."
34176,Homer,that is the most amazing donut i've ever tasted.
34177,Homer,and you like potato...
34183,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. with me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride."
34187,Homer,"hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--"
34188,Homer,"hmm, maybe this is my lucky day."
34189,Homer,"a disc? please be compact, please be compact! woo-hoo!"
34196,Homer,i'm almost there... i can see the church steeple in the distance...
34202,Homer,"i'm a-comin', marge!"
34206,Homer,could you scooch over a bit?
34209,Homer,"now, what should i buy first? hitler's baseball? a mirror that gives me advice?"
34211,Homer,marge? what are you doing?
34220,Homer,you go rent us a truck.
34227,Homer,um... your cut of what?
34230,Homer,do you think you could use someone like me in your band?
34235,Homer,"with that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
34239,Homer,"um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
34240,Homer,i agreed to no such thing!
34241,Homer,where and what time?
34245,Homer,"boy, this has gone too far -- i quit! as soon as i finish these oats."
34247,Homer,"okay, i'm taking off the blindfold..."
34268,Homer,"let us curl, m'lady. let us throw and sweep a'twain until the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! and afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. and if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of november, we shall proclaim that we were curling!"
34283,Homer,it's stuck!
34284,Homer,can i help you with that?
34290,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
34296,Homer,"listen, lisa. you're gonna find more than you bargained for. if i were you, i wouldn't dig into the past. i lived in some of that past, and i got out for a reason."
34299,Homer,"good point, bart."
34307,Homer,"listen, wrinkles! if you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. or i can make things very uncomfortable for you."
34326,Homer,you don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
34327,Homer,well don't be wrong in front of our son!
34328,Homer,oh yeah? well .
34346,Homer,"you may not realize this, bart, but your mother and i have been fighting about you a lot lately. and i've realized our marriage is more important than your future. from now on, you're on your own."
34347,Homer,"uh, marge? i don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh..."
34348,Homer,"i love watching you knit. it reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
34357,Homer,well i'll be! there's a sofa in here!
34358,Homer,must... squeeze... harder!
34369,Homer,your mother thinks i'm working on the car!
34372,Homer,i could kiss you.
34377,Homer,and the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
34379,Homer,i finally caught one of bart's school plays.
34380,Homer,"yeah, now that i look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
34387,Homer,i can't! latkes aren't as good as american pancakes.
34400,Homer,"boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
34404,Homer,"hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. what are you up to?"
34416,Homer,ned!
34421,Homer,good luck surviving without me!
34422,Homer,thir-sty / i am so thir-sty / and hungry and horny / but mostly just thir-sty / i am so thir-sty...
34424,Homer,so salty... maybe if i... add a little salt...
34425,Homer,"chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?"
34427,Homer,"i am more than alive, woman! i am the chosen one who shall unite all the faiths of the holy land! i am... the messiah!"
34428,Homer,oh yeah. gotta keep track of those.
34432,Homer,"the dome of the rock? messiah, away!"
34433,Homer,"this one says ""carolina panthers!"""
34438,Homer,spread the word! peace and chicken!
34443,Homer,woo hoo!
34444,Homer,"i say burns owes us a party. let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
34454,Homer,you don't think i'm going to?
34459,Homer,g-g-g-g-hags!
34460,Homer,"mr. smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. and because i know you ""like your loafers light,"" i want to give something back."
34473,Homer,"better lie low, my sweet red friend."
34477,Homer,just my lunch.
34479,Homer,"shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything."
34493,Homer,"hey, would it be okay if i uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"
34496,Homer,chief... me too.
34501,Homer,"don't worry, sarah. clancy was there for me. and i'll be there for him."
34510,Homer,"okay, maybe i lied. but you've been so needy... ""i'm hungry,"" ""i'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
34511,Homer,"hey man, you planted that!"
34512,Homer,"oh, everything reminds me of clancy."
34514,Homer,i have an idea. but i must go alone. my car is filled with printer paper i stole from work.
34515,Homer,"hey, chief. i uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket."
34516,Homer,"well, i was kind of ungrateful. you did save my life."
34527,Homer,"hmm... alternative energy expo. where there's expos, there's free frisbees! let's roll. but we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out."
34533,Homer,"hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
34536,Homer,oh my goodness! it means we're traveling back in time! i can warn president lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
34538,Homer,"hello, local utility? you greedy bastards have gouged homer simpson for the last time."
34546,Homer,you used to be nicer!
34550,Homer,we'll have to eat thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
34557,Homer,but that would make a great movie.
34562,Homer,"one, two, three, tug!"
34564,Homer,"don't worry, honey. right now she's lying on god's beach."
34574,Homer,nature is a toothless dying hag! we are gonna save those whale babies!
34579,Homer,typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
34587,Homer,guess what company had a giveaway at moe's last night?
34594,Homer,i'm on my way!
34602,Homer,"a phony bird call?! that means marge is coming! everyone, act legal!"
34604,Homer,"remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? well, now i can afford a motorcycle!"
34606,Homer,"oh no! i don't have to listen to you. if i'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
34614,Homer,"i like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
34616,Homer,cartoons! everybody be quiet!
34628,Homer,can't talk! must text!
34633,Homer,"marge, this is crazy!"
34636,Homer,what the--
34639,Homer,you take that back!
34645,Homer,"yeah, padre. how innocuous are your flashbacks?"
34654,Homer,"oh marge, you not leaving with moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
34660,Homer,"but my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!"
34664,Homer,ice cream!
34668,Homer,it's like you're a chinese empress!
34678,Homer,hmmmm. not ugly enough. i want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
34680,Homer,"you never fail to nauseate me, boy."
34683,Homer,"but if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
34684,Homer,it doesn't matter.
34699,Homer,"well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. so, i decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny i left in my pants went."
34708,Homer,arctic circle! i just got that!
34713,Homer,did you say a hague?
34714,Homer,wait! not so fast! we found something to save krusty.
34726,Homer,"sure, sure!"
34728,Homer,i believe this stranger!
34729,Homer,check and mate.
34737,Homer,"come on on, the cardboard's fine."
34751,Homer,woo hoo! underpants dinner!
34753,Homer,"sorry marge, i gotta call bullcrap on that. the '69 mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about ron swoboda's wife and kids? not me -- and, i assume, not ron swoboda!"
34762,Homer,woo hoo! another ladder!
34764,Homer,"man, it's been a crazy morning. champagne?"
34768,Homer,oh baby. let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
34769,Homer,"oh yeah baby, i like it when you're distracted."
34775,Homer,"hey, i've had a hard trip too. one of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
34778,Homer,why do pie makers get all the girls?
34787,Homer,come 'n' get it barnacles!
34792,Homer,"we had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
34793,Homer,looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
34795,Homer,bankers away!
34797,Homer,"marge, what are you doing? that pie is poisoned!"
34799,Homer,ever wonder what she thinks about?
34800,Homer,"i know, i know. don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows frankenstein. it's racist somehow."
34803,Homer,"okay, okay. if you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
34819,Homer,"maggie, you can't climb into the tv. if you could, i'd make alex trebek answer some questions."
34822,Homer,you can't tell what's inside! of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
34824,Homer,"aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!"
34825,Homer,you're lucky you're behind glass.
34826,Homer,"sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
34840,Homer,she does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
34849,Homer,thank you.
34850,Homer,all right!
34851,Homer,"your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. so, by the power vested in me, i now pronounce you sweet dreams."
34855,Homer,all right. we'll get the vaccine.
34857,Homer,why did burns make us all come here?
34864,Homer,"okay, burnsie, follow the carrot!"
34872,Homer,"no, i'm no-ot! yes i am. the bloody hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of london..."
34879,Homer,"is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken i played, lost to, and ate at the state fair?"
34880,Homer,way ahead of you.
34882,Homer,"hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
34885,Homer,what they don't suspect is that i'm into this.
34889,Homer,stupid dog!
34898,Homer,"hmm... back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, flanders' mailbox, lenny's freezer, tire fire."
34900,Homer,it was still too much.
34906,Homer,hey!
34937,Homer,"fine, i'll come clean."
34940,Homer,"c'mon, jus' one more drink, marge."
34945,Homer,"c'mon, lou. gimme a break!"
34955,Homer,"your honor, i would like to request a sidebar."
34956,Homer,"all that time i'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise..."
34957,Homer,i repeat: unable to exercise...
34960,Homer,can i be johnny undercover?
34967,Homer,"i'd like a third helping, please."
34968,Homer,just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
34972,Homer,what's a dime store?
34973,Homer,blue pants power!
34974,Homer,beating? what beating?
34983,Homer,"sorry, boss."
34985,Homer,oh yeah. i got in your gang and you barely know who i am.
34991,Homer,huh?
34998,Homer,ohhhh.
34999,Homer,no! you're wrong! check again!
35000,Homer,"so that's it! you used me to kill a man, and all i get is a handshake and a blanket?"
35004,Homer,"no, no, i oversold it."
35009,Homer,"do what you gotta do. the quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
35015,Homer,and your enemies closer?
35016,Homer,fit tony took his cousin's place running the springfield mob.
35021,Homer,can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
35029,Homer,because you're my best friend in the room.
35034,Homer,this is late for marge. i assume. i've never been home at this hour.
35038,Homer,right... neither am i.
35042,Homer,can we at least drink beer or something?
35043,Homer,"oh, you beautiful man."
35053,Homer,"hey, i didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--"
35055,Homer,ah! got one!
35072,Homer,that's great.
35080,Homer,"yeah, i do know a lot about nuclears."
35082,Homer,oh yeah? i'll show you.
35086,Homer,"check this out, bart. one of those retinal scan dealies. it only opens to my eye or an exact copy."
35098,Homer,"okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? i can stand here all day."
35102,Homer,"now all you need are customers. well, better get home to the little woman."
35109,Homer,"well, it's not easy with you talking all the time."
35117,Homer,"yes, that's exactly it!"
35119,Homer,"so lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?"
35121,Homer,deal!
35129,Homer,"is my job creating power, empowering?"
35131,Homer,he's dying in a retirement home. now kiss me.
35143,Homer,he what?...
35158,Homer,hey! don't you know it's awards season? who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
35162,Homer,hmm... who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
35170,Homer,"that's great, honey. if you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
35171,Homer,"hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
35173,Homer,and there's something else it might be good for.
35184,Homer,that's what i was gonna call it!
35186,Homer,your grandfather is not a monster.
35189,Homer,"so, i guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
35205,Homer,dave's not here! dave's not here!
35208,Homer,"dave's not here, man!"
35209,Homer,dave?
35211,Homer,i'll give dave your message.
35223,Homer,hard work? i thought this was gonna be fun.
35226,Homer,"oh yeah, a reward from cheech!"
35232,Homer,stop speaking spanish!
35243,Homer,"hold on, lemme get the door here."
35250,Homer,okay!
35251,Homer,all right!
35263,Homer,tickle tickle too!
35267,Homer,"oh, i don't know if i can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. i-- whoo!... but i sincerely whoo!"
35270,Homer,bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
35274,Homer,"well of course, i would love to be a more sensitive father. you know that."
35284,Homer,why didn't you tell me not to come?
35292,Homer,now it feels like morning. what i am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
35296,Homer,i'll teach you to...
35306,Homer,"i-i said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir."
35322,Homer,my ear makes money?
35326,Homer,i forgot why i'm doing this.
35328,Homer,i can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. i'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
35330,Homer,"okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. so why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down."
35339,Homer,"well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" blob and blob lite. tweedle yuck and tweedle blecch."
35343,Homer,i'm trying. i swear i'm trying.
35359,Homer,wouldn't they be girls?
35360,Homer,you know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
35362,Homer,i'll just sit here quietly.
35368,Homer,"that's a wife ring? marge, don't look!"
35370,Homer,which is lucky for me because you're always right.
35376,Homer,"and now, to break the news as gently as i know how."
35377,Homer,wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
35380,Homer,that's just what i was going for! i was going for scary.
35394,Homer,"oh yeah. men are such dogs, and vice versa."
35396,Homer,oh?!
35397,Homer,these are really good scissors.
35399,Homer,when i look at you -- all i see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! foibles! foibles! foibles!
35404,Homer,"c'mon, bro, don't hassle me!"
35409,Homer,"oh my god. like mozart and johnny knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!"
35411,Homer,why doesn't anything kill me?
35416,Homer,as long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
35419,Homer,and these keys are from all my jobs.
35449,Homer,"fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!"
35452,Homer,you're a real jerrrk!
35455,Homer,all pooted out.
35457,Homer,little help...
35467,Homer,"whoa! flanders, this chick does not get our thing!"
35470,Homer,"hey ned, can i borrow some hair?"
35475,Homer,"ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' edna, then i don't wanna be brainheaded."
35479,Homer,fellow barflies! to ned flanders and edna krabappel!
35483,Homer,"don't you mean ""neighboreeno?"""
35484,Homer,"you stupid jerks! i can't believe you could be so cruel! especially you, joey kramer!"
35491,Homer,"there's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
35492,Homer,right. teasing.
35496,Homer,quiet steps are what i take / sneaking in at noon...
35497,Homer,just in time for my lunch break / got my fork and spoon
35500,Homer,"i'm still drunk from last night, / got driven home, i don't know by whom."
35501,Homer,"some may say / i don't deserve any pay, but hey / i came up with ""sixties day"""
35502,Homer,last may!
35516,Homer,"no, a guy at work seems not to like me. i guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
35519,Homer,oh. okay.
35521,Homer,want a ride?
35522,Homer,"you know, i just got a little chill when you said my name."
35523,Homer,"look, i'm not weird or anything, i just like to feel like i'm friends with everybody."
35524,Homer,but what if the weathergirl--
35527,Homer,wayne?
35532,Homer,"wayne, stop! that's mr. burns."
35538,Homer,or maybe it was him.
35539,Homer,"man, this robot really gets me."
35541,Homer,"neh, they couldn't find a google map photo without me naked or urinating."
35545,Homer,he has no friends.
35569,Homer,what? two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
35572,Homer,"later, losers."
35578,Homer,i'm fine.
35580,Homer,this is so horrible -- i can't speak...
35585,Homer,it's alive?!
35588,Homer,"well, at least i still look good."
35594,Homer,"you forgot patty and selma. oh, wait. that hasn't happened yet."
35601,Homer,language.
35610,Homer,"hello, young man burns."
35611,Homer,that sucker soaks up flattery like a twinkie soaks up gravy.
35612,Homer,oh well!
35614,Homer,awww...
35620,Homer,"oh, uh, roz, i have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. could you cover for me?"
35621,Homer,"woo hoo! oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
35627,Homer,"i'm telling you guys, roz told old man burns i ditched work early and now i'm her assistant."
35635,Homer,can one of the hundred be making the list?
35636,Homer,can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
35643,Homer,"that's it! that's it! my nightmare is over! oh flanders, you are my personal savior!"
35644,Homer,hail flanders! mightier than jesus!
35645,Homer,"congratulations, roz."
35646,Homer,"uh, i just came to say that you're perfect. so perfect, i think mr. burns should give you a hug."
35654,Homer,"this saturday, from the dad who brought you ""cemetery paintball"" and ""go-karts on real roads,"" comes the greatest activity yet..."
35655,Homer,and check these out...
35663,Homer,woo-hoo!
35693,Homer,"you know, i'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. maybe i'll like it."
35695,Homer,"so it's weird -- don't worry, i'll make it fun."
35713,Homer,"we're not here for you, we're here for lenny."
35743,Homer,woo-hoo!
35748,Homer,"gentlemen! to ""the troll twins of underbridge academy!"""
35749,Homer,"so, does this square us for kansas city?"
35754,Homer,somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
35757,Homer,"well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
35759,Homer,you switched the drives?
35762,Homer,"mr. burns, so glad you're here! finally the party can get started!"
35765,Homer,"just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
35770,Homer,"well, in that case..."
35778,Homer,awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
35782,Homer,"ah, mr. mayor! more peanut nore?"
35792,Homer,"oh sorry, sweetie. bart can read it to you."
35793,Homer,and kiss.
35795,Homer,close enough.
35800,Homer,you don't understand me. only she understands me.
35802,Homer,uh... i got here after you did.
35805,Homer,"that's great, let me run the numbers because i really want the simpson account. and give these cigars to your children."
35807,Homer,i'll handle it. i always do.
35814,Homer,"uh... marge, why don't i catch us some salmon?"
35818,Homer,enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
35820,Homer,"let's see, my family gives me love and sex. my work gives me money and sleep..."
35821,Homer,my co-workers are like a family. but in some ways my family is like a family too...
35824,Homer,"hey kids, i'm it!"
35826,Homer,"yep, your worries are over. i'm back to being a boring old safety inspector at a nuclear power plant."
35833,Homer,"everything's a rip-off of ""the honeymooners."" margie, you're the greatest."
35836,Homer,"now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
35842,Homer,"wow, i can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!"
35845,Homer,"are we done yet? ""it's a wonderful life"" is about to start. i wonder what my life would've been like if i'd never seen that movie..."
35849,Homer,"ooo, a b-mail!"
35850,Homer,"hey, i got a b-mail too! ""you have won a valuable prize! open now""..."
35854,Homer,"no, i just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
35857,Homer,"""bloody harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! now, i'm gonna show these boys downtown springfield."
35859,Homer,this is where my father is.
35862,Homer,"dad, these are your great-grandsons."
35868,Homer,"i love you, dad."
35870,Homer,i just don't understand the world of grownups.
35873,Homer,don't argue in front of the airport line. strangers are judging our marriage!
35875,Homer,"yes, but i never use that kind of toothpaste!"
35876,Homer,try to catch one on your tongue.
35878,Homer,"now, if i fart, that's 'cause i'm so relaxed."
35880,Homer,huh? what the--
35885,Homer,never putting me next to a pretty girl...
35891,Homer,and why is there moisture in between the windows?!
35905,Homer,"aw, son. now i regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
35913,Homer,"a high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
35914,Homer,goodnight and good gravy.
35924,Homer,"you all know i'm a big fan of american meat. although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
35943,Homer,"so, how come your picture's not on money?"
35946,Homer,nerds! you want i should mess 'em up?
35951,Homer,"lisa, you were right! i'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!"
35952,Homer,"yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?"
35970,Homer,down in front!
35972,Homer,but i'm invested in the characters.
35987,Homer,i don't trust this place. where are the cashiers?
35990,Homer,"this computer is so great! i'm watching the latest sofia coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
35997,Homer,then why did you say it?
36008,Homer,"...and that's why i really don't believe there's a god. thank you, and god bless america."
36009,Homer,well i'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
36010,Homer,witty.
36011,Homer,needs flavor.
36012,Homer,that's better.
36034,Homer,"don't worry. my last words will be ""i can outrun that lion."""
36037,Homer,i can do this... i can do this...
36045,Homer,"i always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
36046,Homer,good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
36052,Homer,fine.
36053,Homer,please. put that down.
36081,Homer,now i'm over here!
36082,Homer,"hey lenny, welcome aboard."
36083,Homer,"now, i gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
36088,Homer,"true, true."
36097,Homer,wow. i don't believe the simpsons will be shopping at the kwik-e-mart anymore.
36099,Homer,friends are the only people you can betray! and you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
36109,Homer,a pity kiss?! that tears it! i'm gonna call that paula paul and give her a piece of my mind!
36112,Homer,aw... i mean arrrgh!
36123,Homer,this isn't comfortable at all! i don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
36127,Homer,"heard about this thing, boy?"
36140,Homer,pay for your genius!
36141,Homer,"oh, what's the use? when a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
36142,Homer,"well, we do."
36147,Homer,"chief, i believe i have the answer in the back of my car."
36149,Homer,unguarded stuffff...!
36154,Homer,"well sir, before i do anything i stop and ask myself, ""what would jesus and mr. burns do?"""
36161,Homer,i wet the bed! the one embarrassing thing i've never done!
36164,Homer,"don't yell at me, brain! this happened on your watch! you have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!"
36169,Homer,"deep down, i must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! and my problem won't stop till i make things right with them. but first, a little more sleep."
36173,Homer,free? uh...
36174,Homer,free it is!
36186,Homer,"marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside."
36188,Homer,"hey, guys! whatcha doing in my dream?"
36190,Homer,my brain's fine! in my dreams i'm an intermediate skier!
36204,Homer,"exactly like chandler, always criticizing."

36249,Homer,so you guys have any luck finding a new job?
36252,Homer,"when the moon hits your eye / like a big pizza pie / that's amore / when the world seems... when you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid."
36254,Homer,"i just have to press this button, right..."
36255,Homer,"well, at least it doesn't feel pain."
36256,Homer,wait a minute...
36258,Homer,"so, bart, the little dickens, is going through that phase where young boys think their dad's an idiot."
36259,Homer,that's exactly what i'm having! you guys totally get me.
36263,Homer,what happened to you guys? you used to be cool.
36269,Homer,shut up! shut up! shut up!!!
36274,Homer,"and here i was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. you know, it's crazy, but..."
36286,Homer,"just say ""kill me,"" jerks!"
36288,Homer,i'm doomed!
36290,Homer,aren't we getting num-nums?
36293,Homer,and his arm can be my back-scratcher.
36301,Homer,"ooo, here's one: ""happy little elves two: the sequelf."" two kids."
36305,Homer,sure. what's your name?

36327,Homer,a plane crash!
36328,Homer,wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!
36332,Homer,"marge, there're so many mysteries that i need to have solved."
36338,Homer,at last! this episode promises to finally answer one question!
36341,Homer,"ooh, that's great! can it wait another hundred and four hours?"
36343,Homer,oh that's such a first-take answer!
36348,Homer,"i'm sorry, sweetie. it's just a strandie discussion group. yes it is! we discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
36351,Homer,well...
36356,Homer,bart's been raptured! and his crap's been craptured!
36364,Homer,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! which he drops in the water!
36365,Homer,and here's the worst part: i never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
36376,Homer,what about the duty-free stuff we bought?
36377,Homer,my booze and cologne!
36382,Homer,now that's what i call a snappy retort!
36383,Homer,he turned that russian guy into swiss cheese!
36395,Homer,"now, listen, lisa--"
36398,Homer,but you're not...
36404,Homer,"man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
36411,Homer,what the? no one can see you.
36422,Homer,"i got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation."
36425,Homer,i have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.
36430,Homer,"strad, where are you?"
36433,Homer,"actually, i was supposed to be back last week. we'll just wait for the call from human resources."
36442,Homer,what's that a reference to?
36451,Homer,they cannot judge me. only my father can judge me.
36457,Homer,"tonight, you shall be at my right hand in heaven."
36458,Homer,"outta my way, stupid flanders!"
36467,Homer,people here do not respect boundaries.
36481,Homer,"welcome, money-changers! you can trust sleazy sam for the best rates, or my name isn't jesus h.--"
36493,Homer,no.
36509,Homer,well... i also keep things interesting.
36510,Homer,"you see? hey, what are you looking at?"
36519,Homer,"i'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""
36523,Homer,i didn't say i swapped our house.
36526,Homer,"oh, geez. not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
36533,Homer,why you little... where's that ice cream?
36543,Homer,lisa! do you have a stray dog down there?
36546,Homer,maybe.
36548,Homer,"hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? help a brother out, b.h."
36553,Homer,i am nature's perfect choking machine!
36557,Homer,treasures? gifts? you got it all wrong. that stuff is just our old--
36558,Homer,day one.
36559,Homer,we've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
36563,Homer,night one. wanna snuggle?
36570,Homer,"oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. now go to bed."
36573,Homer,"ooh, i can't wait for tonight's massacre."
36582,Homer,"ooh, i like that. now, i'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
36583,Homer,cinnamon!

36588,Homer,woo hoo!
36589,Homer,"i gotta hand it to you, marge. you got the exact amount of car for our family. room for two adults, three kids, and zero grampas."
36592,Homer,"so, you're not totally unqualified."
36597,Homer,"well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. when do you think things first went wrong?"
36602,Homer,just appreciating how lucky i am to be with you.
36603,Homer,"and let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
36608,Homer,"eh, nothing we can do."
36609,Homer,it's true... that's how i got the money to buy you your necklace.
36612,Homer,"okay, but just for a minute. we want to hit the candle store, fudgerama, the zipper hall of fame, snow globe world, and the taj meatball."
36629,Homer,are you sure there isn't more? i mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
36632,Homer,"geez. i mean, i'm no luis guzman, but i'm all right."
36634,Homer,this is the worst pain imaginable!
36638,Homer,"two adults, please."
36644,Homer,"my burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, i talk about how much money i'm going to make from the lawsuit."
36652,Homer,"open file, click and...invested! hey lisa, check out your college fund!"
36655,Homer,on a poker site!
36657,Homer,"i've had it for a long time. i was just about to throw it out, and then this happened."
36659,Homer,i'm not superman.
36660,Homer,"ha, of course i do! happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?"
36670,Homer,"flimsy lead, take me away!"
36676,Homer,my dad was an aspiring songwriter like charles manson? i never knew that.
36682,Homer,woo hoo! i get two christmases!
36686,Homer,well just what attracted you to my father?
36693,Homer,"man, you're making me hot for my dad."
36694,Homer,"listen, do you know this man?"
36696,Homer,"dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
36698,Homer,"and i don't think you're boring. it's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. look at sunday night. there's like eight amazing shows. none of them on fox."
36706,Homer,"when i prayed for this concert to be over, i didn't mean like this!"
36714,Homer,you wha?
36715,Homer,in my business i try not be seen. i'm scary good at it.
36730,Homer,are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
36738,Homer,"look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. give it to me!"
36740,Homer,"you are weak, but no."
36746,Homer,"yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now."
36753,Homer,can this day get any worse?
36756,Homer,here it comes...
36759,Homer,"okay, what else... free tibet! you heard me! free him now! thank you. oh, my luck has changed!"
36760,Homer,i left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
36762,Homer,i submit! i submit!
36765,Homer,virtual stapler!
36766,Homer,"sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache."
36770,Homer,the old stupid moustache'll win him over.
36781,Homer,what would you have me do? one basket for each egg?
36789,Homer,it still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
36792,Homer,everybody hear that?
36793,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders."
36795,Homer,"this is your miracle? a tree? ooh, look at me. i turn sunlight into complex sugars. big whoop."
36797,Homer,"well, this is how god would send me a message. in my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. what do you think he's trying to tell me, flanders?"
36798,Homer,fine. i'll just go eat the body of god. that's not crazy.
36800,Homer,to hope!
36805,Homer,i don't know what to believe anymore. maybe it's time to call satan. is that a two-one-two?
36808,Homer,guess it must've been the person who knew i needed hope most of all.
36817,Homer,they're gone!
36821,Homer,i'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.
36823,Homer,i see... devil horns!
36825,Homer,no more donuts?
36836,Homer,"really? i'm... ...cool? oh, can i man-hug you?"
36843,Homer,terence shaved my head!
36854,Homer,"oh man, my goatee has barely come in. why does my hair only grow in twos?"
36873,Homer,"stupid town... at least i've still got moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going..."
36881,Homer,they're necessary! they're necessary!
36887,Homer,"man, that keyboard playing cat is so cute."
36891,Homer,holy moley! he's already made a clearing! let's go for a glade!
36893,Homer,move this here. tap. mill! mill! barn! silo! tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! brothel. parsonage! theater in the round! and... hay pile...
36897,Homer,you're back!
36903,Homer,a lot of good backups. how pregnant is the raccoon?
36904,Homer,"good, marge. get their price down."
36905,Homer,not a crier.
36913,Homer,"oh yeah, baby, i'm drinking you down to your knees."
36918,Homer,how are they his treats if i paid for them?
36927,Homer,everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
36934,Homer,he still has my sweatshirt.
36942,Homer,"sorry, mrs. simpson."
36945,Homer,don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
36948,Homer,where'd they go?
36950,Homer,"what the--? ooh, it's hopeless."
36957,Homer,real matuuure!
36961,Homer,"apes... deep down we're all savage apes. leave your body, homer."
36967,Homer,"oh my god! this unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!"
36969,Homer,it's based on nothing!
36970,Homer,"i'd slash my wrists! but how, without my electric knife?!"
36979,Homer,"yeah, but i'll go home, weigh myself, and i'll have gained six pounds. what's that about?"
36991,Homer,it's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
37001,Homer,this is my daughter. she brings the gift of music to the new world.
37002,Homer,baritone.
37008,Homer,why do we have to shoot them at all?
37021,Homer,"we can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?"
37028,Homer,lotta people at the dump today.
37041,Homer,woo hoo!
37042,Homer,...and i wish that mr. teeny gets a banana ... that the isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... i wish that wishing wells worked so i wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things i do ...
37049,Homer,"lenny, take us with you to find our dog! it's okay, marge, they're professionals."
37050,Homer,hey!
37057,Homer,"help me, god! what is it i'm paying you for every sunday?"
37060,Homer,"yes, it won't give!"
37067,Homer,"okay, you're right. it's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but i think the choice is obvious -- my dad."
37072,Homer,that's some impressive flute-nastics.
37077,Homer,"okay, i'll nudge 'em with the car. we'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
37080,Homer,"ooh, thanks, dad."
37083,Homer,"no, no, no. i meant pushing kids on swings."
37095,Homer,"suckers!!! oh wait, you've gotta initial this."
37098,Homer,"marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit."
37112,Homer,we've won. woo hoo.
37115,Homer,i do call this living! living the way kids in india can only dream of!
37122,Homer,"if you're lucky, me, then this."
37131,Homer,"hand me my suitcase, boy."
37144,Homer,"the same way hollywood does, by watching british movies!"
37146,Homer,after we finish watching the movie.
37147,Homer,i wrote this song to say i'm sorry
37148,Homer,the melody is by beethoven
37155,Homer,"if i buy you, why do i need all these books?"
37164,Homer,sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.
37172,Homer,...thimble from monopoly game...
37190,Homer,why you little! that's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
37192,Homer,"writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of dui's. the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs."
37206,Homer,beefcake mags?
37207,Homer,that's insane! my dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. my gay dad is gay for gays.
37213,Homer,no fatties!
37215,Homer,"if i can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then i've failed as a son."
37242,Homer,this room just got a whole lot cooler.
37243,Homer,look at the size of that bird! i'd go henry the eighth on those drumsticks.
37244,Homer,"yeah, it's medicinal. we had a pain in our neck."
37246,Homer,but the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
37251,Homer,"thanks, flanders. punch my eye, destroy my marriage. now just pull the plug and let me die."
37254,Homer,union!
37255,Homer,"marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" but don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. so, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
37258,Homer,"hey, i don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
37267,Homer,"you may be the sweater man, but homer is the better man."
37271,Homer,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
37281,Homer,help me god!
37284,Homer,now do me wearing a sombrero!
37290,Homer,"keep it under your hat, guys, but i've got a date with a married woman."
37291,Homer,her husband's gonna be there too.
37294,Homer,when we got married i promised you a life full of romance. now here it is.
37296,Homer,oh yeah.
37299,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
37307,Homer,"listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other."
37309,Homer,"oh my god! a marriage so perfect that i could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. what do i do?! what do i do?!"
37311,Homer,where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
37313,Homer,"i'm fightin' for ya, babe. fighting like i would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. and to show you how serious i am..."
37320,Homer,that was yesterday.
37324,Homer,what have i told you about comical entrances?
37334,Homer,"once again, by eating alone i have saved my marriage."
37335,Homer,"for reasons i forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. but what i know for sure, is that i want to share it with you."
37343,Homer,oh marge! come to the ga-rage! you know it'll be good 'cause i'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!
37348,Homer,what does that mean?
37349,Homer,it's behind the dingle swing.
37350,Homer,"so, you forgive me?"
37353,Homer,what size batteries.
37356,Homer,really? you wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
37368,Homer,"padre, can i be honest with you? i've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. but there isn't."
37374,Homer,just looking for the bathroom.
37375,Homer,but this paper towel feels so good.
37394,Homer,is that the radon detector?
37396,Homer,"well, i can't part with a single one of my ""hoarders""! hands off my episodes of ""episodes,"" and if you delete ""revenge""..."
37404,Homer,he's back!
37405,Homer,the woman i love!
37408,Homer,"they're like a wedding ring, i can't take them off anymore."
37414,Homer,stupid clog...
37417,Homer,woo hoo!
37419,Homer,is it that obvious?
37439,Homer,"oh marge, when you hold me like that..."
37454,Homer,"so freaking far in the ground, baby."
37457,Homer,i wasn't thinking that! carl's our good friend.
37476,Homer,"all right, this is it, carl's family home. twenty-two..."
37479,Homer,"aw, dammit, we lost him!"
37519,Homer,"yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. and i promise each anniversary will be better and better..."
37521,Homer,"yeah, just like we did with bart. anyway, this year i'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."
37525,Homer,you stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
37529,Homer,there's no such place!
37532,Homer,the surprise is safe! the expression on her face will be priceless!
37533,Homer,currently: zero.
37535,Homer,"hey, those yelp reviews don't write themselves. did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?"
37537,Homer,all worth it for marge!
37539,Homer,because it's in the public domain?
37551,Homer,costume drama or naughty comedy?
37552,Homer,"you just dodged a bullet, mister sugarpants."
37554,Homer,honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
37555,Homer,"oh baby, that's all i needed to hear."
37558,Homer,you deserve what you get...
37561,Homer,"ooh, my lava's almost cooled!"
37563,Homer,"now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag."
37572,Homer,"i overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
37576,Homer,that kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
37583,Homer,moving my body.
37590,Homer,so i heard half of nothing.
37593,Homer,see you on the other side.
37594,Homer,of the house. where the fireplace is. we're toasting marshmallows. marshmallows.
37599,Homer,"let's just say i've got to get to work on time. and if you knew me, you'd know just how odd that sounds."
37612,Homer,i've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!
37623,Homer,we sure did.
37626,Homer,shut up.
37632,Homer,"great... oh, and i have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."
37641,Homer,"marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus."
37648,Homer,the ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. now let's get you married.
37651,Homer,ho ho ho! a very small time!
37652,Homer,"those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. now, the toast..."
37654,Homer,one of us! gooble goo!
37656,Homer,"strong man, moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. leave my trailer forever!"
37661,Homer,"...and that, kids, is how i met your mother."
37672,Homer,you misheard that on purpose!
37673,Homer,"um... it says i should give you ""lumbar support."" better go to the lumberyard..."
37676,Homer,that is a good fire.
37682,Homer,why does everyone know?!
37683,Homer,my boy's okay!
37686,Homer,what the?! if this kid's dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
37687,Homer,"once again, cats have it better."
37688,Homer,"look at me, i'm afraid of dying!"
37696,Homer,so sad.
37702,Homer,"yeah, well listen, pal. i have my treasure: my wife and my children."
37705,Homer,really? now? i have two pizzas coming. i wanted to see who would get here first.
37713,Homer,let's do it.
37720,Homer,okay.
37721,Homer,i'm doing it! i'm flying like the squirrel i always knew i was.
37722,Homer,"ooh, indigo!"
37740,Homer,"timing the elevators, eh? smart."
37746,Homer,"oh, he was just here."
37749,Homer,"yeah, wow, that does feel good. oh no, i think it's coming. i haven't even picked a name yet!"
37766,Homer,where's hoju? where's hoju? where's hoju?!
37767,Homer,where's hoju? where's hojuuu?!
37775,Homer,"oh baby, shake it! homer like!"
37779,Homer,"marge, it's not what you think!"
37781,Homer,"but you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
37782,Homer,i haven't had a drink for a week.
37784,Homer,"goodbye, homer junior. i guess you're the man of the house now. and never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
37787,Homer,"sleep, sleep sleep sleep / sleep sleep / sleep, sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep!"
37792,Homer,i was talking about myself in the third person.
37793,Homer,"i wanted you all to be happy together, so i brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony."
37795,Homer,"why you little... i'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! c'mere, you!"
37798,Homer,i have a soul and you guys don't!
37801,Homer,"i'm sorry, homer junior. you'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill."
37806,Homer,"um, he likes it if you tickle his toes."
37822,Homer,my name is homer / i'm a real full back / gonna run that ball / don't want no flack...
37823,Homer,why you little--
37828,Homer,"get real, ding dong! you've already done so much bad stuff, skinner's never going to let you on that boat."
37829,Homer,"marge, i love bart as much as you do but actually not. and that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, i'm going to moe's."
37830,Homer,ooh! thank you.
37847,Homer,someday i may have to fake my own death. and maybe you can help me with that.
37856,Homer,"oh good. marge remarried after i died. wait a minute, i'm not dead. what's goin' on?"
37863,Homer,fine. i'll drink alone.
37864,Homer,the secret is don't read the comment cards.
37865,Homer,i thought they were just gonna watch me.
37868,Homer,you got me weed?
37878,Homer,stop talking! i haven't seen it yet!
37881,Homer,amazing grace / how loud i sing / to drown the spoilers out... shut up. shut up. shut up!
37888,Homer,"all right, movie, you better be worth it."
37890,Homer,i wonder what else is chicks?
37892,Homer,you're shushing me! this guy's on his cell phone! she's texting! he's sexting! and that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
37894,Homer,illegally download it? is that legal?
37895,Homer,"wow, that was easy! all i had to do was click on--"
37902,Homer,"welcome to ""cinema pirate-diso."" tonight's movie is ""life is funny,"" directed by judd apatow. it's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. so for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
37903,Homer,"i live it, he writes it."
37905,Homer,"let me? uh, sweetheart, i downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
37911,Homer,"superintendent chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same hawaiian shirt to that luau!"
37916,Homer,forever!
37917,Homer,what are you guys in for?
37924,Homer,thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. you're the greatest wife in the world.
37929,Homer,no.
37933,Homer,"one family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
37942,Homer,up bup bup bup bup! what have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
37944,Homer,"and miss the back half of jimmy kimmel? that's when he experiments, boy."
37949,Homer,and now to moe's.
37952,Homer,but why pick me?
37955,Homer,"not garbage, americana."
37962,Homer,i didn't tell you about the basement.
37963,Homer,"no, discipline would imply i'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
37965,Homer,why didn't i stop with the snake wine? why did i drink the fish wine?
37967,Homer,why you slimy little...!?
37971,Homer,i hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
37982,Homer,"as early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
37986,Homer,"okay, let's see what we've got here."
37999,Homer,"carl, it's me! i'm here! really here!"
38005,Homer,monitors?!
38013,Homer,wait a minute. marge said we were out of ice cream.
38016,Homer,why isn't she having an affair?
38018,Homer,"marge, that's a compact-only space!"
38027,Homer,"yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, marge?"
38031,Homer,oh my god... marge needs this. it lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
38036,Homer,"okay, marge. but first, well, i have something i need to tell you. something i did you might be mad about, and rightly so."
38041,Homer,excuse me. i have to make a call.
38047,Homer,do you have my money?
38052,Homer,"where's my money? do you have my money? where is it? you know, if you had the money, i'm right here. do you have the money?"
38053,Homer,"pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, marge."
38054,Homer,quit pressuring me!
38059,Homer,"i don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
38063,Homer,but it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
38069,Homer,"look, the eagles and the falcons. tell me you're not interested in that."
38082,Homer,that's why i've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
38086,Homer,sorry.
38087,Homer,"listen, you punks. if you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place."
38095,Homer,"my contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"
38098,Homer,"honey, grampa is the closest thing i have to a father and i love him. but three octogenocerouses?"
38099,Homer,speak for yourself. glug-glug-glug. chomp-chomp-chomp. beeeeep. my lifestyle is my retirement plan.
38100,Homer,"uh... c'mon, boy. your job is to guide me."
38101,Homer,"i mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
38103,Homer,"i've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. they pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!"
38125,Homer,we've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
38140,Homer,i don't know. how 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
38143,Homer,you guys are crazy. i've never even heard of that guy. it's not like it was painted by leonardo da vinci code.
38145,Homer,"nobody touch it! bart, stop looking at it!"
38148,Homer,"split it? whoa. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
38153,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
38158,Homer,"i would feel: a). happy for their good fortune, b). proud to know rich people, and c). grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
38159,Homer,then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
38174,Homer,"with that painting we could have what these people have. a money cushion. no more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
38175,Homer,that's the cushion.
38177,Homer,"""you have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" ooo, a support rock!"
38179,Homer,"the paddles, marge! look at the paddles!"
38193,Homer,that proves the painting is mine! and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
38203,Homer,i'll pay you in strupo...
38204,Homer,rockin'
38207,Homer,pathetic.
38214,Homer,there's sausage being made? where?
38219,Homer,much better.
38220,Homer,"well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. except at my profession."
38227,Homer,what the?!
38230,Homer,the stomach wants what it wants. i need some air.
38249,Homer,you're a funny one to tell me about deception.
38250,Homer,"well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
38255,Homer,no penalty!
38257,Homer,no penalty!
38263,Homer,um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. turn on eighty-nine point nine.
38264,Homer,"like most of my problems, it all started at moe's..."
38269,Homer,"am i gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
38271,Homer,"oh, are the kids with you?"
38274,Homer,competitive eater? did i hear right? i could be a competitive eater?
38280,Homer,what the?
38292,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid!"
38293,Homer,"uh, yeah. hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and i should have dinner together, sometime..."
38295,Homer,woo-hoo! i got a date with my daughter!
38299,Homer,"hey, i can't screw this up or lisa will get stuck with someone like me."
38302,Homer,"maggie, help me with this shirt."
38305,Homer,i mean for adults!
38308,Homer,"oh, uh. vegetarian. can the red sauce be cow blood?"
38311,Homer,a friend from high school.
38312,Homer,"i'm sorry, that's all very nice. but i can't forget what you said."
38320,Homer,legs pumping! blood flowing!
38323,Homer,i'm number two!
38326,Homer,i'm back! comin' through!
38327,Homer,"yeah, i can die all i want -- frink's got homers like the tuileries has park benches. huh? wonder where i picked that up."
38329,Homer,wait a minute!
38331,Homer,"bonk! bonk! bonk! ooh, corner! ba-donk!"
38337,Homer,just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...
38352,Homer,"yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
38353,Homer,whoa. that's a bit of a woo-hoo. indeed.
38355,Homer,"well, better get home. the delightfulness ended hours ago."
38367,Homer,eat the nuts! they're your dinner!
38371,Homer,"do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
38378,Homer,"come on, buddy. just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
38380,Homer,not like that. it's like this. ...smithers ... ...mr. largo... ...danny kaye... what? everyone knows.
38381,Homer,now where's she going?
38390,Homer,roll in hay!
38396,Homer,ooh! can i lick the ceiling?
38401,Homer,but...
38402,Homer,they all make good points.
38405,Homer,dinner party at the neighbors'. at least i can drink.
38415,Homer,more?
38421,Homer,woo-hoo!
38423,Homer,it might be easier with maggie. she's always getting letters from the daycare center.
38425,Homer,who are you?
38429,Homer,"see, marge. problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone."
38437,Homer,"don't worry, marge. as a favor to you, i'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp."
38438,Homer,needs more numerators.
38457,Homer,"one more year, tops."
38462,Homer,usher! will you stop that person who's shushing?!
38470,Homer,"lisa, what are you doing?"
38482,Homer,that better not mean what it means when i say it.
38489,Homer,today's our draft! i've got to pick a good fantasy team! when i lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
38494,Homer,you did that on purpose! you lick this table clean!
38502,Homer,"wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. you're enjoying this, aren't you?"
38504,Homer,betrayed by my worst enemy. i never would have seen it coming.
38506,Homer,i hate the golden age of sail.
38507,Homer,"fine. i'll swab whatever you say. look, i'm swabbing the deck. i'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. oh! i'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
38517,Homer,"aye-aye, sir."
38528,Homer,don't you give up on me!
38532,Homer,"still hungry, buddy?"
38546,Homer,"hey, tony roma's wasn't built in a day. but don't worry. i told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. you do have drone delivery, right? i kinda promised that."
38550,Homer,hillbillies!
38557,Homer,please tell me i'm still beautiful!
38559,Homer,mmm. sandwich.
38561,Homer,"keep your pants on, marge. it's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" and parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
38566,Homer,"yeah, i'll be sure to take a look at that."
38574,Homer,"all right, show yourselves in the name of this book!"
38577,Homer,he is me!
38583,Homer,"well, hello."
38586,Homer,"i think he gets it. see, he--"
38599,Homer,ha! i gotcha!
38600,Homer,you can't resist smoking in the house any more than i can resist drinking in the car.
38607,Homer,"i'm not screwing you over. no, uh... i'm not screwing you over. i'm not screwing you over."
38608,Homer,some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. but what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
38612,Homer,magical nonsense.
38614,Homer,pornography and nachos.
38616,Homer,high-quality methamphetamines.
38619,Homer,"good, judge away."
38624,Homer,oh baby...
38626,Homer,glad i could be of help...
38630,Homer,"was on fire. was. i finally get a job i was good at, and now i have to give it up."
38637,Homer,wait... i finally get what you're saying. fracking is great. but the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
38651,Homer,prove it. what happens to homer simpson in the future?
38652,Homer,oh. my. god. he's telling the truth. i have to take you to our civic leaders.
38663,Homer,"i'll explain. okay, it starts free, right?"
38665,Homer,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? you bet i'd like one..."""
38666,Homer,and that's why i owe clash of candies twenty thousand dollars. here we are.
38669,Homer,who is that?!
38671,Homer,my bowling buddy.
38673,Homer,prove it. when's your birthday?
38674,Homer,ha! february has no twenty-third!
38678,Homer,"aww, i will treasure this forever."
38681,Homer,you wanna talk about it?
38688,Homer,"oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. remember?"
38696,Homer,"so, what do you say, marge?"
38698,Homer,"compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
38702,Homer,ooh! how 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
38714,Homer,hey marge!
38718,Homer,get... in... the tent!
38719,Homer,just like i planned.
38723,Homer,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the quebec nordiques became the colorado avalanche.
38724,Homer,"lisa, how many times have i told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?"
38737,Homer,"oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? it's so easy."
38738,Homer,so easy.
38752,Homer,"buddy, buddy. think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night. you just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
38755,Homer,"guys, i really need your honesty here. at the squidport senior jamboree... was i too in the pocket?"
38757,Homer,what kind of erotic asphyxiation?
38758,Homer,oh...
38767,Homer,"phil collins-era genesis is not as good, huh? ""no reply at all,"" ""land of confusion,"" ""throwing it all away,"" ""illegal alien,"" ""i can't dance,"" and i'm sure i don't need to mention... ""invisible touch!"""
38768,Homer,what? so you can also get famous and bail on us? you're out of the band!
38769,Homer,"oh, so you're sticking up for yoko here? looks like i've got another yoko on my hands."
38772,Homer,they're not juicy. my licks are dry. dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
38781,Homer,"kwik-e-mart hot dog, eh?"
38786,Homer,"headin' home, baby."
38789,Homer,i'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
38794,Homer,"hey, what the--"
38795,Homer,i am so late!
38797,Homer,"yeah?! well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!"
38808,Homer,"yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?"
38809,Homer,"aw, thanks for your honesty, apu. is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
38820,Homer,flanders? what are you doing here?
38825,Homer,because jerk-ass homer has become ass-jerk homer.
38827,Homer,i made everyone happy but me. some christmas. feliz navidad.
38850,Homer,"you planted that on me, man!"
38854,Homer,"lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. let's go."
38876,Homer,fine.
38877,Homer,this isn't a happy thing!
38879,Homer,what the?!
38885,Homer,i'd like rabbit. lots of rabbit.
38898,Homer,oh who am i kidding? i couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. i'm going back to save them.
38900,Homer,i think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
38902,Homer,what's that?
38923,Homer,"the circus? hmmm, i haven't been to the circus since i was a kid."
38928,Homer,the early bird gets the shaft!
38935,Homer,fine. but i'll be amazed if i'm astounded.
38936,Homer,"hey, is that time right? i have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
38942,Homer,no i'm not.
38944,Homer,yes you are.
38953,Homer,"get the ball, boy! c'mon!"
38973,Homer,wanna see me make a muscle?
38974,Homer,"well, that's everything i know that girls like."
38975,Homer,okay.
38979,Homer,bloated corpse under the water. i'd say he's been there a few months at least. interesting the way his lips move just like mine. why do you ask?
38985,Homer,ooh! i've missed you too.
38994,Homer,it is!
39002,Homer,"not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!"
39007,Homer,perfect! just like when we let you name maggie.
39009,Homer,"oh my god! brace yourselves, family. we're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. boy, get me my baseball bat."
39016,Homer,"fine. we'll both go. and if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
39025,Homer,well duh!
39029,Homer,so... what kind of lunch do you pack?
39043,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! you saved my life. which is gonna make what i'm about to say even more awkward...
39047,Homer,it's on your face too!
39052,Homer,the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... wearing a helmet... wearing a helmet..
39072,Homer,hmmm.
39074,Homer,"i'm sorry, i thought you were over-feeders anonymous."
39084,Homer,i have a beauty of a sort to some.
39096,Homer,"sorry, fellas. there's a movement i have to join. i've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating."
39101,Homer,"guys, i'm comin' back in. suck in your guts."
39102,Homer,i was distinctly promised no math!
39105,Homer,"marge, i believe you're forgetting america's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: professor x of the x-men."
39114,Homer,at last.
39122,Homer,hey moe... i'll take care of the bar. you did me a favor today.
39123,Homer,"man, moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
39124,Homer,there's no guys! we haven't made any money.
39128,Homer,"look moe, the least you could let me do is anything i want."
39134,Homer,"well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
39135,Homer,"you know, moe, you're a real jerk. i didn't mind so much when it came with beer."
39142,Homer,"oh, uh, i will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. shut your eyes."
39147,Homer,"sorry, marge. but i am the royal babysitter. if i start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
39150,Homer,"he's called ""the bachelor."""
39166,Homer,there was beer involved. i have two daughters. and i've learned you have to let them go their own way. even the one-year-old.
39169,Homer,but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
39173,Homer,"go, go make magic. you just go."
39174,Homer,revue...
39186,Homer,i'm comin' for ya baby!
39194,Homer,i knew you had a vise! i knew it!
39208,Homer,"marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?"
39211,Homer,sorry. i'm just a big kid and i love christmas so much.
39212,Homer,...every year.
39213,Homer,a what!
39216,Homer,who's this?
39221,Homer,"it's too bright. that flanders, what a big show-off."
39235,Homer,"oooh... pads of paper. i bet bart can think of a million things to do with these. that just leaves little maggie. oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . it says it's for dogs, but she can't read..."
39241,Homer,"thanks, moe."
39244,Homer,what do you mean? all the time? even when they're nuts?
39246,Homer,"huh, when do we get paid?"
39257,Homer,"well, i was just on my way out to get one."
39261,Homer,that's an ornament.
39268,Homer,"now let's not get mushy, son. i still have a job to do."
39282,Homer,uh-uh.
39284,Homer,who's tiny tim?
39287,Homer,what! that scrawny little bag of bones?
39290,Homer,whoa! ninety-nine times thirteen equals mer-ry christmas!
39300,Homer,"find any winners, son?"
39316,Homer,get outta here.
39317,Homer,"wait a minute, you little cheater. you're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
39326,Homer,a what?
39329,Homer,oh.
39334,Homer,"nonsense, marge! frosty krusty flakes are what got him where he is today."
39337,Homer,gotcha!
39338,Homer,"don't worry son, you can have mine. here, let me show you how to put on a tie."
39342,Homer,what?
39346,Homer,jeez. no beer... no opera dogs...
39347,Homer,"don't stifle the boy, marge. we're supposed to encourage him."
39356,Homer,"oh, you don't think so, eh? well, here comes some real heat."
39359,Homer,"don't be discouraged, son. i bet einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb."
39360,Homer,"what is it, son?"
39366,Homer,nothin's easy.
39387,Homer,not even close.
39388,Homer,"""dear family: i am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. by the time you read this, i will be in my watery grave. i can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'stand tall, have courage and never give up.' i only hope i can provide a better model in death than i did in life. warmest regards, love homer j. simpson."""
39389,Homer,almost there.
39403,Homer,that's okay. i'll just assume you said what i thought i heard you say.
39413,Homer,"me in charge of safety? this place could blow sky-high. nah. i'll concentrate on my work now. gee, this guy's desk sure is big. i can't let marge support the family. this guy's got the cleanest shirt i've ever seen. what should i..."
39424,Homer,whoa! easy! don't drop me! be careful.
39445,Homer,is it used?
39446,Homer,you remember the rules from last year?
39451,Homer,wahhhhhhhhh!
39460,Homer,no. we're going to say grace first.
39461,Homer,"no! ignore the boy, lord. now can the chatter and bow your heads. dear lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. i mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my french... but they act like savages! did you see them at the picnic? oh, of course you did. you're everywhere. you're omnivorous. oh, lord, why did you smite me with this family?"
39466,Homer,yahhhhhhhh!
39468,Homer,i wish i could hear what they're saying.
39472,Homer,"another beer, moe."
39473,Homer,i've got some wieners in my pocket.
39479,Homer,"all right, time for a family meeting!"
39482,Homer,"honey, i've given this matter a lot of study. and of all the commercials i saw, his was the best. all it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars."
39488,Homer,would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely motorola?
39492,Homer,bart!
39493,Homer,lisa!
39504,Homer,"wait a minute, doc! your tv commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
39510,Homer,no.
39512,Homer,"well, you see, boy. it never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
39515,Homer,"yeah, and i got the day off from work."
39519,Homer,"bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something."
39522,Homer,"come on, marge. i don't bug you when you're helping lisa."
39524,Homer,"the code of the school yard, marge! the rules that teach a boy to be a man. let's see... don't tattle... always make fun of those different from you... never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... hmmm, what else... ?"
39527,Homer,"well, thank you very much, mrs. maharishi gandhi. let's go, boy."
39529,Homer,"no, no! not like that! like this!"
39540,Homer,"lisa! lisa, are you still in there? what's the problem? did you fall in? lisa!"
39548,Homer,"come on, come on. let's go."
39552,Homer,"get out of the way! how come he's not ducking? ugh! wait a minute, i can't get my... get out of the way, stupid!"
39558,Homer,well... eh... er...eh...
39560,Homer,thanks for knowing i mean well.
39562,Homer,"in times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. now hop to it, boy!"
39564,Homer,"oh, no, come on! don't let that boy -- get out of the... oh, no, not again! don't. don't. don't. great, get over. oh, geeze."
39575,Homer,"oh, no, marge!"
39582,Homer,"hey, that kid's pretty good."
39597,Homer,"my game! my game! i coulda beat the boy! marge, how could you? i was so close."
39599,Homer,"just be happy with what you got, son. don't try to keep up with the flanderses."
39605,Homer,where is it?
39608,Homer,"hey, how much is it?"
39615,Homer,how much do you want for it?
39616,Homer,i swear it bob.
39619,Homer,"oh, well, i don't know. would it be alright if i conferred with my family?"
39628,Homer,i'll tell you when we get there. go back to your smell game.
39633,Homer,all righty.
39639,Homer,wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
39651,Homer,"through here, boy. back to civilization."
39659,Homer,"okay, slap a fern on there, boy. now, some mud. there. ooh! that requires a little mollusk. and mollusk for me. all right. we're ready to hit the town."
39663,Homer,shhhh! just watch.
39677,Homer,just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. food!
39683,Homer,can i have some apple sauce?
39684,Homer,"oh, marge. the guys at work are going to have a field day with this."
39685,Homer,"ooh, those stupid eggheads."
39690,Homer,"we'll die together, like a father and son should."
39695,Homer,"but you don't understand, marge. i have fifty bucks riding on this game."
39713,Homer,"i can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?"
39721,Homer,"you're not talking about killing anyone, are you?"
39727,Homer,i knew it all along.
39745,Homer,hmmmm!
39754,Homer,"you always say we should talk. i'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. but i'm going to stop in a second. so, please say something back, marge, please. i'm gonna stop talking... now."
39755,Homer,what? no...
39771,Homer,'night.
39774,Homer,for marge?
39776,Homer,"oh, sorry... ouch!"
39782,Homer,how can i eat it? she made it. it's all i have left.
39783,Homer,marge!
39793,Homer,"no, my supervisor."
39795,Homer,bart! what are you doing?
39796,Homer,where am i... the planet cornball?
39799,Homer,"ooh, look at him squirm."
39803,Homer,"sorry, buddy. you got me confused with fred flintstone."
39806,Homer,"well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!"
39811,Homer,your photo?
39817,Homer,"aw, i knew you'd come to your..."
39818,Homer,"oh, moe. my wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture."
39823,Homer,"no, barn. i just want to crawl into bed."
39824,Homer,oh no.
39833,Homer,"hello, marge. it's me. homer."
39839,Homer,"okay. your wish is my command, my little..."
39847,Homer,could you tell him a little about yourself?
39848,Homer,thank you very much ma'am. we'll be out of your...
39854,Homer,"quiet! i have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. it's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. no, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. and you know something, folks? as ridiculous as it sounds, i would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as i sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's g-string. am i wrong, or am i right?"
39861,Homer,the boy. bring me the boy.
39875,Homer,"bon voyage, boy."
39878,Homer,be good.
39882,Homer,"affectionate little albanian, isn't he?"
39886,Homer,just kidding.
39889,Homer,aww. you called me dad.
39891,Homer,none of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
39898,Homer,"come along, adil."
39911,Homer,aw!
39921,Homer,y'ello.
39922,Homer,"oooh, premium -- wait a minute. why?"
39923,Homer,"how you doin', apu?"
39934,Homer,"oh, definitely number... heh heh..."
39937,Homer,"oh fantastic. marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. i was down at the kwik-e-mart minding my own business when... oooh oooh, ooh, the news."
39948,Homer,oooh.
39949,Homer,ahhhh!
39952,Homer,"i hope you do find that punk someday, moe. fill 'er up."
39955,Homer,what?
39961,Homer,"uh, you know, pretty ones. like that."
39970,Homer,"actually, the simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family."
39972,Homer,"ba, ba / ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba..."
39975,Homer,"out, boy, out."
39981,Homer,they all look so tasty. but i think i'll eat this one right there.
39985,Homer,because i'm so carefree?
39998,Homer,all right. i suppose my work here is done.
40004,Homer,"just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. no, no, triple."
40010,Homer,"have you ever seen a kung fu movie? it was just like that. but now i know her moves. so, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on homer simpson again."
40011,Homer,"lord help me, i'm just not that bright."
40014,Homer,"eww, i hate that icky soup skin."
40024,Homer,"just a little dim, i guess."
40030,Homer,hmmm huh.
40038,Homer,we're proud of you boy.
40044,Homer,hair... hair... just like everybody else.
40050,Homer,out of tartar sauce.
40052,Homer,"if i had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that."
40055,Homer,you got me!
40068,Homer,"yes, mr. smithers."
40073,Homer,i de...
40077,Homer,"you got it, buddy!"
40078,Homer,ooh. beauty.
40079,Homer,do any of these suits do that?
40091,Homer,"can do, sir."
40094,Homer,"uh, well okay, what the hey?"
40099,Homer,"well, thanks, karl. i don't know what to say."
40114,Homer,a lot of you would think i was crazy if i did this.
40115,Homer,"yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- i can save this company millions of dollars a year. how? through jiko kanri, the japanese art of self-management. you see, in the west... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
40119,Homer,"what! oh thank you, thank you, thank you."
40122,Homer,"are you kidding? i'm stuck in that dead-end job again. the kids are gonna hate me cause i can't buy them all that stuff i promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause i'm ugly and bald."
40125,Homer,i'm everything you need /
40127,Homer,"to me."""
40129,Homer,wait a minute. let's see what the kids are up to.
40141,Homer,"now wait a minute, marge. it's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. it's a fixer-upper. what's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here..."
40149,Homer,an ancient indian what...?
40151,Homer,"aw, gee, marge."
40165,Homer,tell us more about this feast.
40171,Homer,"'tis some visitor,"
40185,Homer,"get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
40197,Homer,ah! uh... i'm just resting my eyes. holy moly! nine-thirty.
40198,Homer,"hello, marge. sorry i didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me."
40199,Homer,"echo, echo..."
40203,Homer,"ooooh, cushy."
40204,Homer,"well, nobody's perfect."
40207,Homer,"uh... don't get me wrong. i mean you're an honest man. i just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'course i'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. i mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't."
40209,Homer,"if it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?"
40211,Homer,mary bailey isn't going to fire me if i don't vote for her. i'm for monty burns.
40224,Homer,what's that got to do with it?
40226,Homer,huh?
40227,Homer,"hey! hello, handsome!"
40229,Homer,"are you all right, mr. burns?"
40230,Homer,"bart, would you like to say grace?"
40231,Homer,"""you know, mr. burns, my family and i feel that taxes are too high. where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"""
40237,Homer,"look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. it's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. and i never want that to happen to me."
40238,Homer,"well, okay. it all started on ""nuclear plant employees, spouses, and no more than three children night,"" down at springfield stadium."
40247,Homer,"wow! flash bailor came on to my wife! you've still got the magic, marge."
40260,Homer,little baby batter / can't control his bladder!
40270,Homer,"i should have slept on it. or at least stared blankly for a while. perhaps if i'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."
40272,Homer,"nope, this was my own bright idea. c'mon, we gotta hurry. don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. save room for your nachos."
40274,Homer,"oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
40278,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. you can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. you make me sick."
40279,Homer,me? in the majors?
40280,Homer,"wait a minute, capital city has a mascot. the greatest mascot there is: the capital city ""goofball""."
40281,Homer,i'll say!
40282,Homer,because they might say no.
40290,Homer,"oh, knock it off, flanders! don't start blubbering on me. i'm gonna miss you too... not."
40291,Homer,"... some may say that i have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as i leave for capital city, i consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth!"
40293,Homer,"well kids, there it is, capital city."
40297,Homer,the duff brewery!
40298,Homer,"sorry, honey. i'm just a little nervous."
40300,Homer,"okay, here are your tickets. they're supposed to be good. you're sitting with the player's wives. and don't forget to cheer for me."
40302,Homer,wow.
40309,Homer,"mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. uh oh."
40319,Homer,bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
40324,Homer,marge! where's the duff?
40331,Homer,"all right, knock it off!"
40332,Homer,you've been rubbing my nose in it since i got here. your family is better than my family. your beer comes from farther away than my beer. you and your son like each other. your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. you make me sick!
40349,Homer,"too bad we don't live on a farm. let's go, boy."
40350,Homer,fore!
40353,Homer,"i know, i know. i can still make this for five. come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. pleeze."
40362,Homer,"stay, stay. good dog. now, keep your head down."
40368,Homer,your putter's name is charlene!
40373,Homer,"but, marge, this is our big chance to show up the flanderses."
40374,Homer,because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. and i'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
40376,Homer,bart! what're you doing? get down from there before the neighbors see --
40377,Homer,"flanders, i don't care what this looks like, bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."

40472,Homer,"come on marge, we're mad at 'im."
40476,Homer,"you didn't mean that. bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises i don't expect you to keep. if you make this promise, you have to keep it."
40482,Homer,bart? bart?
40489,Homer,"you know, marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
40493,Homer,"boy, i've tried ordering you, i've tried punishing you, and god help me, i even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
40506,Homer,pick - up - a - ham - mer...
40513,Homer,"because you said so, why?"
40515,Homer,"heh, heh, heh."
40518,Homer,"everybody's looking at us, marge."
40530,Homer,"... oh, hey, thank you, maggie."

40584,Homer,"i'm saying... she's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. i'm not sure i love you anymore."
40587,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i love you more than ever."
40588,Homer,"sorry to scare you like that, babe."
40590,Homer,"isn't there anything faster than a microwave? four, three, two, one, ping!"
40603,Homer,no.
40604,Homer,no!

40796,Homer,"marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
40798,Homer,"ohhh! oh, marge! this'll be the greatest night of your life. i've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but i'm gonna spend it all on us. i'm renting the biggest limo. i'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. my tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw."

40826,Homer,and i never have.
40828,Homer,"hey, flanders. who put that bug up your butt?"
40832,Homer,i want free cable.
40834,Homer,so you've decided to steal cable.
40838,Homer,"oh, hey, hey. family, family, come here. i have an announcement to make. the simpsons have cable."

40902,Homer,"come on, boy."
40905,Homer,the greatest fight ever and i missed it.
40906,Homer,"cable clippers, please."
40910,Homer,this is like some beautiful dream.
40912,Homer,"marge, i'm only human. now look, here's what we're gonna do. we'll unload the kids on patty and selma saturday night. and then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. just like old times."
40920,Homer,but marge...
40928,Homer,what is it this time?
40937,Homer,like my wife's ugly sister.
40943,Homer,"... and thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. amen."
40944,Homer,"quiet, you kids! if i hear one more word, bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and lisa doesn't get to go to college."
40945,Homer,not one word.
40950,Homer,"oh dad, you and your imagination."
40958,Homer,"excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
40966,Homer,"oh, oh... i get it. okay. here's twenty bucks. now will you tell me where my brother lives?"

41057,Homer,"oh man, two dollars. uh, i'll take these three... they're for my daughter."
41063,Homer,"yep! hee, hee. read 'em and weep."

41108,Homer,oh no! dad's lost his hearing.
41112,Homer,i miss my daddy.
41117,Homer,"bart! forgive him, dad. he's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. but, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence."
41119,Homer,"miss, i'm looking for abe simpson."
41120,Homer,it's important i get a hold of him. i have to tell him i don't care about his money and i love him.
41122,Homer,"a double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for god's sakes, hurry!"
41127,Homer,but you could lose everything. come on.
41138,Homer,oh no! urg... arrrgh. c'mon you stupid tube!!!
41144,Homer,"marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
41145,Homer,"but i'm going on a diet. from this day forward i pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! as god is my witness, i'll always be hungry again!"
41152,Homer,"don't you know anything, boy? that's ringo starr."

41212,Homer,"thinking is your department, jerk! that's what i pay you in beer for!"
41218,Homer,now how about a hug?
41219,Homer,it's a deal!
41220,Homer,tell a lie. tell a lie.
41221,Homer,don't tell him. give him a fake name.
41222,Homer,don't you get it? you gotta use a reverse psychology.
41224,Homer,donald trump? no. arnold palmer? no. bill cosby? no.
41229,Homer,i would'a never thought of that.
41230,Homer,what does that mean? better say something or they'll think you're stupid.
41235,Homer,"that's it, i'm getting outta here."
41238,Homer,"heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. well, off to the plant."
41243,Homer,"oh my god, he is coming on to me."
41245,Homer,"oh man, i've really got to go to the bathroom. why did i have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?"
41247,Homer,"no, the other secret."

41254,Homer,"mental note: ""the girl knows too much."""
41255,Homer,"something was said: not good. what was it? ""don't yell at homer."" no, that's okay. what was it? ""slow."" they called you ""slow!"""

41257,Homer,eatthepuddingeatthepudding eatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthe pudding.
41261,Homer,"no, no! why embarrass us both? just write a check and i'll release some more endorphins."
41267,Homer,"there it is, homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. and nobody heard it."
41274,Homer,you're leaving the arm there too long! you wanna make it worse?!
41277,Homer,just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
41278,Homer,keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
41279,Homer,i've already gone this far... i wonder what my life would be like if i robbed the kwik-e- mart?
41282,Homer,wow. that saxophone would make a great pipe.
41283,Homer,don't you get it? they're using us as patsies to make the army look good.
41288,Homer,"that's right, numbskull! your son's made a fool of you in front of the whole town!"
41297,Homer,"all right! ""try it"" means sex."
41315,Homer,food goes in here.

41339,Homer,"no cops in sight. if i'm gonna save that clerk, i'm gonna have to take the law into my own hands again."
41344,Homer,don't worry -- they're just friends. there's nothing physical between them.
41348,Homer,"oh man, what do i do? wait -- the book marge gave me!"
41354,Homer,a million dollars -- now i'm really glad i didn't die!
41356,Homer,"calm down, homer. calm down."

41373,Homer,she'll forgive me...
41380,Homer,...mcnuggets.
41385,Homer,"you have reached the office of homer simpson. if you are calling about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. if you need--"

41441,Homer,"forget it, doc! what if that's my marriage in there?"
41447,Homer,"eh, i think that's all of 'em."
41452,Homer,"hey, professor von hubba-hubba! wanna hop in my dune bug and erode some beach?"
41453,Homer,"come on, baby. the only math you need is you plus me equals forever."

41461,Homer,they're too big to fail.
41465,Homer,who are you?
41470,Homer,you're the idiot.
41479,Homer,i've traveled through space and time to make marge settle for me because she doesn't know better.
41481,Homer,"for an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall. food, fun and fashion -- the mall has it all!"
41488,Homer,"mmm, that's good. more, more! refill! free!"

41529,Homer,you applied to college? why didn't you tell me?
41548,Homer,slam!
41549,Homer,"i can't do it! our harmony-laden r&b doesn't make sense in this cruel world. i'm taking our music to the next level: guitar rock utilizing nihilist grunge energies. or, as i call it: grunge."
41551,Homer,pain is brown / hate is white / love is black / stab the night /
41553,Homer,marge!
41557,Homer,yeah.
41558,Homer,"okay, i'll keep the l.p.s and you take the c.d.s. i'll take the typewriter, you take the computer. i'll take the enron stock, you take the microsoft stock. and um..."

13159,Homer,hi.
13167,Homer,"good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
13172,Homer,now's my chance.

13225,Homer,now you tell me!
13229,Homer,"you can run, but you can't glide!"
13234,Homer,then there's those other days. where you just wish you never got married or had kids.
13236,Homer,"so whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye..."
13238,Homer,i heard lenny had a terrible fall.
13241,Homer,"""levi's."" hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
13246,Homer,what the hell was i thinking?

13314,Homer,"come on, you're holding out on me."
13317,Homer,"hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"

13369,Homer,"oh dear. if we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. what a kick in the teeth."
13373,Homer,"whoa, better get some gas."

13381,Homer,"none of your business, flanders."
13387,Homer,she's perfect.
13388,Homer,"well, sometimes that can be annoying."
13392,Homer,i only did that a couple of times.
13397,Homer,all right. but i can't sleep. can i take a walk?
13409,Homer,"marge, you don't know what this fish means. this fish represents a better life for both of us. this fish makes me a champion and a hero."
13413,Homer,"wow, i did it! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. i fought it for six hours. she says one word and i toss it back. and you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? come here, baby."
13416,Homer,i never knew what superman saw in her. give me wonder woman! and that golden lariat. she can tie me up any time.
13417,Homer,"i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!"
13418,Homer,"all right, what are you getting at?"
13419,Homer,"a hundred bucks?! for a comic book? who drew it, micha-ma-langelo?"
13420,Homer,"well, t.s."
13422,Homer,no.
13428,Homer,"no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
13429,Homer,are you?

13435,Homer,are you?
13441,Homer,bart! stop it!

13468,Homer,"lisa, dim the lights! no, turn on more lights! but do something!"
13469,Homer,"it's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
13473,Homer,"marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
13474,Homer,bart!
13476,Homer,"""dear mr. burns. i'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your caard was just great. in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic. you stink!"" could you read that last part back to me?"

13483,Homer,hmmm...
13488,Homer,"bart, have you seen the letter?"
13493,Homer,i'll show you mad in the morning.
13497,Homer,"what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
13498,Homer,"so a few people won't get a few letters. boo-hoo. you know the kinda letters people write: ""dear somebody-you-never-heard-of... how is so-and-so? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. yours truly, some bozo."" big loss."
13500,Homer,that's a good one. we'll use that.
13503,Homer,"hello, my name is mr. burns. i believe you have a letter for me."
13504,Homer,i don't know.
13507,Homer,oops.
13511,Homer,"hey, c'mon, joey! do you have to twist my arm?"
13512,Homer,"oh, i've never seen mr. burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
13517,Homer,"mr. burns, you brought us a present."
13519,Homer,"marge, what does it do?"
13520,Homer,"marge! really, what does it do?"
13522,Homer,"wait a minute. if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
13524,Homer,amen to that!

13598,Homer,"""well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- ain't it the truth."
13603,Homer,"ooh... how about the ""v""?"

13650,Homer,"stupid flanders... always showing off. go ahead, marge, have a ball... what if they game back and i was dead from not eating? they'd cry their eyes out. we should have never gone to the flanders'. oh, why did we go to the flanders' house and leave homer all alone with no food. and i'd be laughing. laughing from my grave."
13665,Homer,ooooh.
13666,Homer,mmmm -- too far.
13669,Homer,oooh. that would be a shame.
13671,Homer,"marge, tv gives so much and asks so little. it's a boy's best friend."

14080,Homer,you're my kid's teacher!
14109,Homer,"oh, what do they want!"

14122,Homer,uh-huh. so what's my stock up to?
14126,Homer,"no, i'd like a bottle of henry k. duff's private reserve."
14127,Homer,"for your information, i just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. buy low, sell high, that's my motto. i may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
14129,Homer,"hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
14136,Homer,what? i sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
14145,Homer,"good, good, i'm learning."

14184,Homer,"yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. for me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
14186,Homer,"actually, bart, i threw up more than your mother. ... it all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
14187,Homer,"those were idealistic days... the candidacy of john anderson, the rise of supertramp... it was an exciting time to be young!"
14193,Homer,where do you think you're going? you're gonna listen to my story.
14194,Homer,your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
14198,Homer,"wow, what an ending? who'd have thought darth vader was luke skywalker's father."
14200,Homer,i'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
14201,Homer,"oh. well he's always happy. no, wait. he's always mad."
14204,Homer,really? it must be the champale talking.
14212,Homer,"marge, there's something i want to ask you. but i'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."

15470,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best jew... but i rented ""fiddler on the roof"", and i will watch it. anyway, can i have forty-thousand dollars?"
15475,Homer,"well, marge, we could do worse."

15974,Homer,"yeah, but i'm not gonna let it change our lives. i'll be the same loving father i've always been."
15977,Homer,"we'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. she's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons."

16101,Homer,"i got it! we wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
16110,Homer,"marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. they'll solve all our problems. they'll elevate us to the status of kings on earth."
16112,Homer,absolutely. now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
16122,Homer,i'm gonna lose my job just 'cause i'm dangerously unqualified.
16130,Homer,"well, i guess it's back to college for me. and that means it's time to... what did i teach you guys?"

16371,Homer,"well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
16379,Homer,"how was jerk practice, boy? did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? huh?"
16384,Homer,"bart, i'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!"
16385,Homer,i'll take it.
16387,Homer,you are not my son.
16389,Homer,"hey, there's a new mexico."
16392,Homer,"in a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
16398,Homer,"well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, i'll just be in charge of the rationing."

16499,Homer,"lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
16501,Homer,shhh. i'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
16519,Homer,"you've gotta improvise, lisa. cloves, tom collins mix, frozen pie crust."
16523,Homer,huh? wuh? lisa? what's up?
16534,Homer,"hello, floreeda."
16543,Homer,"you know, marge, for the first time in our marriage, i can finally look down my nose at you. you have a gambling problem."
16556,Homer,let me check my reason list.
16558,Homer,"alright, these are our new family security rules: be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows."
16581,Homer,move along there.
16583,Homer,"hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?"
16585,Homer,no burning leaves without a permit!
16588,Homer,you're in. here's the sack.
16590,Homer,i 'unno. coast guard?
16598,Homer,why you monster! and you have my daughter's saxophone too!
16606,Homer,he's a burglar.
16610,Homer,nooooo!
16613,Homer,"aw, dad, i could kiss you."
16616,Homer,"actually, it wasn't me. it was my dad, grampa."
16629,Homer,what do you mean you lost him?! he might have fallen into one of these machines!
16632,Homer,"marge, i have some horrible, bone chilling news."
16633,Homer,"oh, nothing."
16642,Homer,ah. oliver north. he was just poured into that uniform.
16643,Homer,"come on, lisa. say something funny."
16645,Homer,"aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about urkel... that little snot. boy i'd like to smack that kid."
16649,Homer,"all right, but after leno i'm all laughed out you know."
16657,Homer,woo hoo!
16666,Homer,"it's true, it's true. we're so lame."
16674,Homer,"stop being such babies. you can't be afraid to try new things. for instance, tonight i'm using a... apu, what do you call this thing again?"
16678,Homer,that's even worse than the album grampa released.
16688,Homer,okay.
16705,Homer,woo hoo!
16706,Homer,"dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
16708,Homer,"ah, come on, marge, you're way too..."
16716,Homer,and we can't watch fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in syria.
16722,Homer,"hello. well, today's the day for homer j. i know i'm gonna win this time."
16723,Homer,"union rule twenty-six - ""every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
16730,Homer,"no, the batteries!"
16738,Homer,"respect?! nooo! it was me! i made the crank call. i do it all the time. check with the fbi, i have a file. i have a fiiiiile."
16744,Homer,"well here i am, right on time. i don't see barney ""let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-white-house-and-kill-the-president"" gumbel."
16747,Homer,mmmmm. mediciney.
16748,Homer,"ahem... i uh... don't think this contest is over yet, buzz. if that is your real name. i believe there is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
16750,Homer,"congratulations, barney."
16756,Homer,"you're right, marge. just like the time i could've met mr. t at the mall. the entire day, i kept saying, i'll go a little later, i'll go a little later.' and then when i got there, they told me he just left. and when i asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. well, i'm never gonna let something like that happen again. i'm going into space, right now."
16763,Homer,no!
16766,Homer,i'll bash you good.
16772,Homer,"what do you mean? it says right here: ""free wig with every purchase of large wig. downtown wig center."" why you little... hmmm... free wig."
16778,Homer,"not flanders. anybody, but flanders."
16780,Homer,excellent guitar riff.
16789,Homer,"well, yeah."
16793,Homer,"hey everybody, here comes fun!"
16795,Homer,"well, i guess i should pay my share..."
16797,Homer,"nacho, nacho man / i want to be a nacho man."
16807,Homer,"wow, thanks. now i have four children. you will be called ""stitch-face."" wow, flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
16811,Homer,"watch this, ned. they don't call me springfield fats just because i'm morbidly obese."
16813,Homer,boring. let's watch something else.
16818,Homer,"i'd like to introduce ned flanders, my best friend."
16826,Homer,"oh of course you'd say something like that, marge. you've hated ned for years. in fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
16831,Homer,"ha, ha. you know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
16835,Homer,"i'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the simpsons and the flanders. if this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the flimpsons."
16850,Homer,i live to give.
16858,Homer,"i'd love to honey, but daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
16865,Homer,"""gomer upsets sergeant carter."" ooooh, i'll never forget that episode!"
16868,Homer,use only in a well ventilated area.
16880,Homer,"marge, i agree with you, in theory. in theory communism works. in theory."
16883,Homer,"oh, everything's cruel according to you. keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. pulling on his tail is cruel. yelling in his ears is cruel. everything is cruel. so excuse me if i'm cruel."
16885,Homer,shut up.
16887,Homer,"hey, any more arboretums around here?"
16896,Homer,"wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
16914,Homer,here's the keys.
16919,Homer,stupid tornado. look. it got patty and selma.
16923,Homer,i'd like it fine.
16924,Homer,"yes, of course i would. who wouldn't like that? to be part of the music scene..."
16928,Homer,i'm alive! i'm alive. and i owe it all to this feisty feline.
16933,Homer,lousy job. nothing exciting ever happens.
16938,Homer,"okay, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say. just read it and you're a shoo-in."
16940,Homer,"it's kurns, stupid!"
16956,Homer,he locked the door! i'll show him.
16959,Homer,"hey, the trail of donuts ended. bart!"
16965,Homer,"give it a try. it's like kissing a peanut. heh, heh, heh."
16968,Homer,"but marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
16969,Homer,"look! ree, ree. ree, ree. aye, aye. all right, all right, i won't take the dog. c'mere."
16975,Homer,sucker.
16986,Homer,"uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
16987,Homer,i'm only doing what i think is right. i believe freddie quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
16991,Homer,"jump, free willy, jump! jump with all your might!"
16993,Homer,"got it, barn?"
17001,Homer,ooh.
17002,Homer,"or, if not then, christmas."
17003,Homer,"hee, hee, hee, hee. that is funny."
17009,Homer,"dad, that will never work. if you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
17010,Homer,"now, what you gotta do / if you want to get a kiss / is act real smooth / and make your move like this."
17012,Homer,all right!
17017,Homer,"woo hoo! three hundred fifty dollars!! now i can buy seventy transcripts of ""nightline""!"
17018,Homer,woo hoo!
17023,Homer,"i mean, woo hoo!"
17027,Homer,how come you're not laughing? do you think i'm slow?
17030,Homer,take another bath in malt liquor?
17033,Homer,"wait a minute, even lenny is teaching a class. look at the way they admire and adore him."
17036,Homer,i've failed again. everybody can teach a class but me. i'm an idiot. what am i gonna tell my wife and kids?
17037,Homer,that depends. is there another way to get this job?
17044,Homer,it's all right! i'm a teacher.
17056,Homer,i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
17061,Homer,"oh, you mean about you. all right, maybe i said some things -- some personal things. but, you should have seen 'em, marge. they really wanted to hear what i had to say."
17063,Homer,yes ma'am.
17065,Homer,"this is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
17072,Homer,and how's my little major leaguer? catch any junebugs today?
17074,Homer,why you little...
17088,Homer,"i love you... will you marry me, marge?... you mean i'm gonna be a daddy?... i hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
17089,Homer,together?
17091,Homer,"lisa, you will respect your new mother. now give her a kiss. kisss herrr."
17106,Homer,wait until my class hears about this. kidding!
17107,Homer,it's great to be indoors with my family.
17110,Homer,"hey, moe!"
17116,Homer,"ooh, the tinkler. i like the sound of that. we'll take it."
17117,Homer,"all right, everybody in the pool!"
17118,Homer,is it a pool yet?
17126,Homer,"but why? she's such a fox. i mean, what's on fox tonight? something ribald, no doubt."
17128,Homer,not everything. there's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
17137,Homer,"we hit the jackpot, here! white gold! texas tea... sweetener."
17139,Homer,"that's because i've loaded it with sugar!!... marge, our ship has come in! i found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that i'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. and all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."
17144,Homer,must... protect... sugar... thieves everywhere... the strong must protect the sweet... the sweet
17147,Homer,"oh am i, am i really?"
17148,Homer,a-ha!
17151,Homer,no!
17156,Homer,nooooooo! my sugar is melting! melting! oh what a world!
17158,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i've learned my lesson. a mountain of sugar is too much for one man. it's clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii."
17161,Homer,"marge, it's three a.m. and i worked all day!"
17163,Homer,hmmm.
17175,Homer,that's unsexy.
17176,Homer,ew.
17182,Homer,oh!
17184,Homer,i was doing my best to resist her...
17186,Homer,"yeah, yeah."
17188,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
17196,Homer,sure.
17199,Homer,"i've got a problem. once you stop this car, i'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then i'll never be able to let you go."
17200,Homer,but not the last.
17201,Homer,"oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. look at this bible i just got. fifteen bucks! and talk about a preachy book! everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
17207,Homer,suckers.
17210,Homer,"okay, let's make a pact. this is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
17221,Homer,"trust me, marge. with today's modern cars you can't get lost. what with all the silicon chips and such."
17226,Homer,"well, okay. if it's fun. let's see..."
17228,Homer,eyeball stew.
17231,Homer,it is the '70s! right down to the smallest detail!
17232,Homer,thank you!
17235,Homer,i kicked a giant mouse in the butt. do i have to draw you a diagram?
17236,Homer,"hey look, this one's coming on to me."
17239,Homer,my hair! you chopped off my hair! oh god i'm ugly!
17243,Homer,but there are five of us.
17264,Homer,"sorry, sorry. don't worry, there's plenty i can do to keep myself occupied. maybe i'll check out that axe collection. see ya later."
17266,Homer,why should i kill my family?
17267,Homer,you don't look so happy.
17268,Homer,"so, what do you think, marge? all i need is a title. i was thinking along the lines of ""no tv and no beer make homer..."" something something."
17280,Homer,"...fading, fading, gone."
17299,Homer,"oh no! they're gaining on me. wait, i have an idea."
17302,Homer,this time i'm not gonna touch a thing.
17304,Homer,"oh, i wish i wish i hadn't killed that fish."
17306,Homer,this is gonna cost me.
17307,Homer,"i mean, heeeyy."
17308,Homer,"hmm. fabulous house. well-behaved kids. sisters-in-law dead. luxury sedan. woo hoo! i hit the jackpot. marge, dear. would you kindly pass me a donut?"
17309,Homer,don't touch anything?!! i'll... touch... whatever... i... feel like!!
17315,Homer,"no, it's not that. didn't you hear? they have no bananas. they have no bananas today."
17319,Homer,"it was, marge. admit it."
17320,Homer,"oh good, here comes the collection plate."
17323,Homer,"son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all i need."
17326,Homer,"ooo, how convenient."
17328,Homer,to the little girl's room!
17346,Homer,"okay, hon."
17362,Homer,i love bart!
17364,Homer,"beer. oh, marge, i love you!"
17366,Homer,they're both losers. losers!
17368,Homer,they hid them in every millionth krusty klump bar and krusty klump bar with almonds.
17380,Homer,"now, this is going to take all my skill."
17384,Homer,"relax, marge, there's plenty for her to do in there."
17388,Homer,precious venus...
17389,Homer,"hey, kids. lots of candy left for breakfast."
17393,Homer,oh that. no. i was just grabbing a gummy venus de milo that got stuck to your pants.
17396,Homer,"that's right, we all thought it was hilarious. but it turns out we were wrong. that alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
17397,Homer,"well, that's kind of a gray area."
17403,Homer,"you mean, i'm on my own? i've never been on my own. oh no! on own! on own! i need help. oh, god help me! help me, god!"
17406,Homer,"...somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed, she was sitting on the gummy venus so i grabbed it off of her. oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. i just wish i had another one right now. but the most important thing is..."
17410,Homer,"... somebody had to take the babysitter home. then i noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so i grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! i just wish i had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
17416,Homer,whaa?
17418,Homer,i don't have a friend in the world.
17427,Homer,"hello. i am homer simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""father goose."" you know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. nobody cares that i didn't do it. but i didn't. okay, look, i've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. so i figured, ""we'll see about that."" so i get this big chunk of cinderblock and i..."
17430,Homer,precious venus...
17437,Homer,"marge, my friend, i haven't learned a thing."
17457,Homer,you're home safe. done my duty. see ya the next time we need your signature.
17468,Homer,"ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?"
17474,Homer,all right! that's it. we're goin' home. i'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
17478,Homer,"i know, but you're never supposed to tell the child."
17482,Homer,"son! my dear son. from now on i'm going to be a good and attentive father. and for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
17485,Homer,wheeee! wheeee!!!
17491,Homer,i'm a screw-up. i burned down our house.
17501,Homer,can't.
17506,Homer,okay.
17509,Homer,"gr-aargh! oh my god, this man is my exact double. that dog has a puffy tail!"
17512,Homer,"shut up, liver."
17513,Homer,"ooh, my liver hurts."
17518,Homer,"yeah, that's exactly why i'm here."
17521,Homer,"and um, ah, i'll just uh get us started..."
17522,Homer,woo hoo!
17525,Homer,"come on marge, i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. i want to explore the world. i want to watch tv in a different time zone. i want to visit strange exotic malls. i'm sick of eating hoagies. i want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. i want to live, marge! won't you let me live? won't you please?"
17526,Homer,"so marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
17527,Homer,"marge, what's wrong? are you hungry? sleepy? gassy? gassy? is it gas? it's gas, isn't it?"
17543,Homer,"all right, lisa, you got your way. your mom's going to a psychiatrist. she's gonna tell marge to leave me. it'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
17552,Homer,"you see?! you see?! ""i"" just left ""my"" first session and ""i"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
17558,Homer,"don't worry about a thing, honey. i'm gonna help you through this."
17564,Homer,lousy traffic jams. the traffic report'll get me outta this one.
17565,Homer,"hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
17573,Homer,"so anyway, lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays. and they don't tell me where they go. it's like a conspiracy."
17577,Homer,all i have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
17578,Homer,"hee hee hee! i can see everything. and they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
17582,Homer,"so, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
17584,Homer,"why don't people like me, marge?"
17589,Homer,what do they do? what don't they do! oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! my stars.
17596,Homer,"comin' through! can't throw me out! my father's a member! i'm in, i'm in!"
17598,Homer,"number one? ha ha. what kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""hello, my name is number one."" and so forth."
17600,Homer,is he the leader?
17601,Homer,"okay, okay, i didn't ask for your life story."
17615,Homer,that's because you trust your stupid school books. here's what really happened at the signing of the declaration of independence...
17617,Homer,"oh, yeah. beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, aa meetings, beer night. it's wonderful, marge. i've never felt so accepted in all my life. these people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which i joined."
17621,Homer,"huh? oh. yeah. thanks, lenny."
17623,Homer,please don't kick me out! this society is everything to me! please give me another chance! i've learned my lesson.
17624,Homer,i've learned my lesson!
17630,Homer,i always wondered if there was a god. and now i know. there is. and it's me.
17638,Homer,"you know, i think you guys are lettin' me win."
17643,Homer,couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
17647,Homer,"hey, fellas. can i join?"
17648,Homer,"loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the battle of gettysburg."
17655,Homer,it was bart.

17661,Homer,"well, i'm glad you asked. it's actually a very interesting story."
17673,Homer,"sorry, that just slipped out. i'll miss ya."
17678,Homer,that's for employing me for eight years! ha ha.
17692,Homer,"it's okay, marge. they pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
17694,Homer,hi maggie.

17701,Homer,"...i slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
17704,Homer,"can't talk, praying. dear lord, the gods have been good to me and i am thankful. for the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
17711,Homer,"this is getting very abstract, but thank you. i do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
17714,Homer,new job?... marge is pregnant?! nooooo!
17717,Homer,you're pregnant again?!
17724,Homer,"yeah, a raise! i've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. but i'm damn good at this one. that's it! i'm gonna march right up to al and say..."

17758,Homer,just a second.
17759,Homer,"what's everyone so worked up about? so there's a comet. big deal. it'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
17763,Homer,flanders! open up!
17767,Homer,there it is.

17804,Homer,"being a clown sucks. you get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. who am i clowning? i have no business being a clown. i'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
17810,Homer,"i'm telling you, marge, this will work. they'll think i'm krusty and give us free stuff. i've been gettin' free stuff all day. look at this swell bucket of house paint."
17814,Homer,"i want everything that's coming to krusty the clown, which is me... krusty."

17956,Homer,"okay! wait a minute. that's bad! look, i know i'm not witty like that critic guy. but does he know all the words to the oscar mayer song?"
17981,Homer,"oh, ah, but mr. milhouse, my little girl's getting married!"
17982,Homer,"oh, i gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news."
17993,Homer,great. there's only one thing i ask in return.
17996,Homer,"marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. i never realized how much i missed it. listen to the murmurs in the next room. the house is full of life again."
18000,Homer,ooh la la.
18001,Homer,"you look great, sweetheart."
18016,Homer,"well, problem solved."
18020,Homer,two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? gimme the ticket.
18028,Homer,ooh... this time... ah...
18032,Homer,mainly your mother.
18033,Homer,splendid. who's coming?
18037,Homer,"marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
18041,Homer,i know. and this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. it just keeps going faster and faster.
18042,Homer,"i'm with you, marge. lisa, get in here! in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."
18045,Homer,"well, i've had just about enough of your vassar bashing young lady."
18054,Homer,woo hoo!
18059,Homer,"what i'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
18065,Homer,jazz. they just make it up as they go along. i could do that. dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
18066,Homer,"ok, then this. doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo"
18072,Homer,then how come that guy's winning?
18075,Homer,"marge, are you okay?"
18083,Homer,"oh marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
18084,Homer,mmm. incapacitating.
18085,Homer,"shush, dear, you'll wreck daddy's fun."
18091,Homer,"hey, hurry it up with the cards, lenny. i've got you clocked at two miles per hour."
18093,Homer,"marge, you chased away all my poker buddies."
18095,Homer,you're cooking what for dinner?
18098,Homer,"i'll just be a second, marge. i'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
18099,Homer,i'll be right back. now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
18109,Homer,hmm... i wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
18114,Homer,"herman, your beef is with me. leave the girl out of this."
18115,Homer,"it's too late for me, marge! sell the jeans and live like a queen."
18116,Homer,marge!
18118,Homer,"he's gettin' away! you blew it, marge!"
18121,Homer,"yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
18122,Homer,what for? nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in hollywood.
18124,Homer,"now, marge, you can't blame all of bart's problems on your one little speech. if anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. and let's not forget your little speech..."
18125,Homer,"yes, there is. come on, everybody, let's go into shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! i got an r.v. we can use... flanders's!"
18130,Homer,that tree's been in springfield since the time of our forefathers. give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
18134,Homer,"oh, great. now i'm upside-down."
18135,Homer,no one in history has ever done anything this clever.
18142,Homer,"i hate my job. i mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
18151,Homer,"oh, you're a dead man! oh, you're dead! you're dead burns!"
18165,Homer,stop telling them it was me. i'll kill you for saying it was me.
18171,Homer,careful now.
18175,Homer,"oh, i always wanted to be a teamster. so lazy and surly. mind if i relax next to you?"
18179,Homer,"what advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? which i could also afford."
18184,Homer,"yeah. if that mafia guy weren't staring at us, i'd take off my towel."
18189,Homer,lousy houseplant!
18213,Homer,"i said shut your ugly face, flanders."
18214,Homer,"oh, there's my sweet little maggie."
18216,Homer,old painty-can ned!
18222,Homer,"ow! help me. why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
18224,Homer,mmm. sounds good.
18238,Homer,"quiet, boy. i have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down."
18242,Homer,aww.
18244,Homer,shut up.
18249,Homer,"you know what you should serve, marge? more of these lamb chops. these are the best ever."
18254,Homer,"yeah, right, lisa. a wonderful, magical animal."
18271,Homer,"marge, tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like i do every morning."
18274,Homer,"bart, go to your room!"
18279,Homer,i dunno. were you looking for me?
18281,Homer,rock stars. is there anything they don't know?
18287,Homer,nuts!
18296,Homer,i told you: flanders has it. or moe! go kill moe.
18307,Homer,did not.
18310,Homer,huh? i never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
18315,Homer,"just a second... no, it's a place i've never been before."
18320,Homer,my stomach sticks way out in front and my...
18323,Homer,"man, this place looks expensive. i feel like i'm wasting a fortune just standing here. better make the most of it."
18336,Homer,eww. this is the worst place yet.
18339,Homer,someone's in here.
18343,Homer,arrgh!
18349,Homer,"um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
18351,Homer,"carpal tunnel syndrome? no. lumber lung? no. juggler's despair? no. achy-breaky pelvis? no. oh, i'm never gonna be disabled. i'm sick of being so healthy!"
18359,Homer,can you recommend a doctor who will?
18361,Homer,"what can i do to speed the whole thing up, doctor?"
18363,Homer,i don't know... fish sandwich? are you sure?
18371,Homer,beautiful. g'night.
18379,Homer,thank you for your pity.
18384,Homer,eight fifty-eight. first time i've ever been early for work. except for all those daylight savings days. lousy farmers.
18385,Homer,"""to start, press any key."" where's the ""any"" key?"
18401,Homer,sound alertness horn? y-e-s.
18405,Homer,"y... y... y... let's see, so many letters to choose from. i'll pick y."
18412,Homer,free sample of fabric softener? woo hoo!
18419,Homer,"one for ""honk,"" please."
18422,Homer,"shame on all of you. give me my dignity! i just came here to see ""honk if you're horny"" in peace."
18424,Homer,"this may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! i'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! the overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. and they're gonna make their voices heard! all they need is a leader!"
18425,Homer,"i'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! what happened to my bird?"
18428,Homer,"omigod, the plant's gonna explode!"
18430,Homer,pressure too high?
18432,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? it's all my fault."
18434,Homer,i gotta call the plant and warn them!
18436,Homer,the ice cream man!
18437,Homer,"get away, dammit! run for your lives!"
18439,Homer,stupid switch! i wish i had my reaching-broom!
18440,Homer,wait a minute! there's probably a --
18447,Homer,sixty-one... sixty-two... sixty-three...

18469,Homer,"hey, mom, lookit me! look at what i can do!"
18481,Homer,seven!
18492,Homer,"oh, yeah... but what i'll mainly remember is the laughter. i wonder what he's doing now?"

18515,Homer,"go on, maggie. go. go."
18525,Homer,"oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane!"
18527,Homer,yabba dabba doo!
18530,Homer,i'll take care of this.
18535,Homer,"but it won't make you unhappy, right? hey! space food sticks! oh, i wish i had these on my space adventure! did you know i was blasted into space two years ago, mom?"
18536,Homer,"no, i work at the nuclear power plant."
18538,Homer,woo hoo! ow!
18543,Homer,"i know how you feel, bart. when i was your age, i wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. well, goodnight."
18547,Homer,"'tis the season, marge! we only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
18548,Homer,"oh, no, i'm not."
18552,Homer,"hmm. wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""menswear?"""
18553,Homer,"maybe it's ""sporting goods""... wait, no, ""sleepwear""... oh, probably ""better living."""
18557,Homer,"stealing?! how could you?! haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? captain what's-his-name? we live in a society of laws. why do you think i took you to all those ""police academy"" movies? for fun? well, i didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? except at that guy who made sound effects. where was i? oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"
18559,Homer,"eh, what are you gonna do?"
18561,Homer,"get 'im, ma!"
18566,Homer,ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
18572,Homer,uh...
18576,Homer,"burns never gives money to anybody. just last week, i asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
18580,Homer,"hey, everybody, if you want to ask burns for a favor, now's the time! he's doped up or dyin' or something!"
18583,Homer,"domo aregatto, mister roboto..."
18585,Homer,it's a 7-10 split.
18586,Homer,the hardest shot in bowling. it was all up to me.
18587,Homer,"so i got up all my courage. right away, my lips started to move and i came up with a chant that won the match."
18590,Homer,but... but...
18593,Homer,"yeah, moe, that team sure did suck last night! they just plain sucked! i've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
18595,Homer,then what are you dressed like that for?
18598,Homer,you want to join my what?
18601,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, next week is the big championship game..."
18612,Homer,"marge, i'm bored."
18621,Homer,"hey! what's wrong with this neighborhood? big shot. too good to buy a house here, snobby?"
18625,Homer,"oh. i wanted to write ""disco stud"" but i ran out of space. not that ""disco stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
18626,Homer,"uh, hey ned, lemme help you with that."
18627,Homer,hey everybody! who thinks flanders should shut up?
18635,Homer,spend some dough at table three!
18643,Homer,"i voted for prell to go back to the old glass bottle. after that, i became deeply cynical."
18657,Homer,"oh, i want trouble all right."
18668,Homer,"so i thought to myself, what would god do in this situation?"
18671,Homer,you didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! never!
18685,Homer,spurlock's cafeteria it is.
18686,Homer,what's the point of going out? we're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
18688,Homer,i wish i was sipowicz.
18689,Homer,simpson family.
18693,Homer,that's one way.
18698,Homer,"just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, marge?"
18699,Homer,seat down.
18701,Homer,"good morning, mr. burns. beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
18710,Homer,so you're not the best golfer here! wait'll i tell everyone about this! you stink!
18711,Homer,bull-honkey! i don't care about joining this stupid club.
18712,Homer,i'm driving up to the main building. they've got valet parking tonight.
18713,Homer,"but marge, valets. for once, maybe someone will call me ""sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
18723,Homer,"um, i'll have four tax burgers, one irs-wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a ficaccino."
18725,Homer,"yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
18728,Homer,"don't let krusty's death get you down, boy. people die all the time. just like that. why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. well, good night."
18732,Homer,"ah! well, if you kids believe in me that much, i'll give it my best shot."
18735,Homer,"less chat, more hat."
18737,Homer,okay.
18746,Homer,lisa?
18749,Homer,"come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
18750,Homer,"town crier. i'd like to ask you a few questions. one: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
18754,Homer,i'm just waitin' for my kid.
18756,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about jebediah springfield."
18758,Homer,dig up his grave! pull out his tongue!

18761,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. let's go home."
18771,Homer,"heh, heh. taft, you old dog..."
18775,Homer,"uh, smithers already left, sir. i'm his replacement, homer simpson."
18779,Homer,i know. i'm taping it. i want to get to mr. burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
18781,Homer,"well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and i'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
18782,Homer,uh... they all won.
18790,Homer,"i'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir."
18795,Homer,i punched mr. burns right in his 104 year-old face.
18797,Homer,"i'm really sorry i hit you, mr. burns. here, let me put some salt on that eye."
18798,Homer,"yes, sir."
18799,Homer,"hi, mr. burns. do you want your coffee now?"
18803,Homer,you shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
18812,Homer,"hello, mr. burns? this is your mother."
18813,Homer,"son, this is mrs. burns! i just called to say i don't love you. you are a bad son, montel!"
18822,Homer,"aw, nertz."
18823,Homer,which one's itchy? the car?
18827,Homer,forget it.
18834,Homer,"yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
18837,Homer,"oh, i love legitimate theater."
18840,Homer,"aw, hell. well... what about dracula?"
18854,Homer,"oh, diablo canyon 2... why can't you be more like diablo canyon 1?"
18859,Homer,"the way i figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
18860,Homer,"well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here i trust. ready?"
18866,Homer,"hello, i'd like to speak with a mr. snotball? first name, ura?"
18876,Homer,i promise.
18877,Homer,"yes, that's a real pickle. would you excuse me for a moment?"
18878,Homer,"all right, i have thought this through. i will send bart the money to fly home, and then i will murder him."
18882,Homer,"and have it sent to the springfield nuclear power plant, care of homer j.--"
18887,Homer,"it's okay. it's okay. i'm back. see, daddy's here."
18896,Homer,"second class? what about social security, bus discounts, medic-alert jewelry, gold bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
18897,Homer,who is it?
18900,Homer,"oh, can i come?"
18901,Homer,pass.
18902,Homer,"looks like bad news for the... ...""impson"" family."
18903,Homer,"let's all calm down. everyone's going to be just fine, as long as i've got enough beer."
18908,Homer,we're here! we're queer! we don't want any more bears!
18909,Homer,"oh, i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year."
18910,Homer,"mr. mayor, i hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
18916,Homer,"lisa, i want to buy your rock."
18917,Homer,"woo-hoo! a perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
18924,Homer,you? pfft. i don't believe it.
18925,Homer,"oh my god. i got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of proposition 24, i never stopped to think it might affect someone i cared about."
18931,Homer,"wow. you must love this country more than i love a cold beer on a hot christmas morning. darn it, apu, i'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
18936,Homer,"hello, selma? selma my dear? how are you? uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... listen, shut up for a second. how would you like to marry apu so he doesn't get deported?"
18939,Homer,correct. now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars?
18945,Homer,"yeah, native americans like us."
18946,Homer,"hi, everyone. if i could just say a few words... i'd be a better public speaker."
18948,Homer,they're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
18949,Homer,"they're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... these people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society."
18952,Homer,no on 24! no on 24! no on 24! no - on - twen - ty - four!
18954,Homer,well we'll have to organize a carpool. every day will be like a road trip!... with your dad!... to school!
18960,Homer,"nobody knows the band, grand funk? the wild shirtless lyrics of mark farner? the bong-rattling bass of mel schacher? the competent drumwork of don brewer? oh, man."
18972,Homer,"back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
18974,Homer,you make me feel like dancing...
18975,Homer,"you wouldn't understand, dad. you're not with it."
18983,Homer,"oh, my homemade kahlua."
18987,Homer,"well, excuuuuuuse me!"
18991,Homer,what did i say? what's going on?
18995,Homer,uh-oh.
18999,Homer,"you know, marge, in some ways you and i are very different people..."
19022,Homer,"sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
19023,Homer,...so i realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
19025,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna die."
19036,Homer,"well, i have been eating more..."
19037,Homer,"bye-bye, job."
19045,Homer,"hey, he looks just like you, poindexter!"
19047,Homer,"hmm. i bet this place sells illegal fireworks. just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
19051,Homer,no lighter?... nothin'?
19052,Homer,"wait, i got it."
19054,Homer,sweet merciful crap! my car!
19055,Homer,"well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."

19089,Homer,"america, take a good look at your beloved candidates! they're nothing but hideous space reptiles!"
19095,Homer,"just bring the rut with you, honey. come on, take a look."
19096,Homer,"ah, let's watch something else."
19099,Homer,thank you! come again!
19100,Homer,we'll never sell this rotten dump.
19107,Homer,okay...
19108,Homer,"yes, once."
19110,Homer,"yes sir, i will notice that. very casual, mr. scorpion."
19116,Homer,don't worry. that won't take long.
19121,Homer,"hey, call me homer."
19122,Homer,"hey, what's with you sad sacks?"
19123,Homer,"mr. scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
19126,Homer,"all right, team, it's the fourth quarter. the lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
19131,Homer,uh-huh.
19156,Homer,"well, my family wants to move back to springfield."
19159,Homer,"""project arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. this will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. it's not the dallas cowboys, but it's a start. drop me a line if you're on the east coast, hank scorpio."""
19164,Homer,like bull you don't! come on!

19222,Homer,"hey, you're that hitchhiker! what are you doing here?"
19234,Homer,of course not. we'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
19235,Homer,"hello, mr. burns, this is the kidnapper. do you miss your son?"
19236,Homer,"if you really love larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
19239,Homer,no!
19247,Homer,"you don't like it, call the cops!"
19266,Homer,i have misplaced my pants.
19267,Homer,"'preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. and i gotta live with him."
19269,Homer,"oh, i don't know how to punish you! what does marge usually do?"
19270,Homer,"c'mon, boy. give your old man a little credit."
19274,Homer,"bart, where are you?! come on! i have to be up at six a.m. to swipe flanders' newspaper!"
19276,Homer,i don't care if he was filling in for mel zetz! he's my son and i don't want him --
19278,Homer,"yes, everyone loves rules..."
19280,Homer,"uh, this isn't gonna be about jesus, is it?"
19289,Homer,no! my friends! stop!
19292,Homer,"what are you doing, marge? didn't you hear the song?"
19296,Homer,"marge, can't we get some clear plates? i can't see the tv."
19298,Homer,"keep it down in there, everybody."
19299,Homer,"yup, pretty much. except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
19300,Homer,"oh, i hate having parties. the toilet always gets backed up."
19315,Homer,thanks for introducing me.
19326,Homer,"ooh, that's tough, pal. but it's never going to happen to me."
19329,Homer,"""dear homer,"" aww. ""sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. i left you hot dogs for dinner. they're thawing in the sink."""
19330,Homer,"lisa, wait! i know you're only eight years old and i don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage."
19334,Homer,mm-hm.
19335,Homer,"oh, i knew this would happen. our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
19343,Homer,"i'd like to file, for divorce."
19344,Homer,marge? can you come in here? we need to talk.
19352,Homer,"eh, mornin', apu."
19353,Homer,whaddya mean?

19363,Homer,will you two shut up?! people are trying to sleep!!
19365,Homer,shut up!!
19370,Homer,hurricane! somehow the animals are always the first to know.
19373,Homer,"okay, it's the standard grampa drill. everybody into the cellar!"
19375,Homer,"all clear, everyone."
19380,Homer,now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.

19401,Homer,"what about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
19403,Homer,"ned, you so crazy."
19404,Homer,"oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""world""... ""the arts""... ""religion"" aha! here it is: ""kickin' back!"""
19405,Homer,"hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
19410,Homer,"hey, marge, you don't smoke!"
19425,Homer,hot! hot!

19437,Homer,"come on, marge! will you... fight fair! i never do this to you!"
19439,Homer,oh... kay. i think i'm gonna be leaving now.
19449,Homer,"marge? marge? oh, now what? if you're still mad at me, i'm gonna be really mad."
19467,Homer,damn straight.
19469,Homer,where's your mother?
19510,Homer,"hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something i can't quite put my finger on."
19516,Homer,uh!
19518,Homer,"no! well, ten beers..."
19527,Homer,you don't have to humiliate me.
19531,Homer,"well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were discussing wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
19535,Homer,"so i says ""blue m & m, red m & m, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
19547,Homer,we'll fake it and sell it to the fox network.
19548,Homer,"now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
19551,Homer,no! no! no-o-o-o-o!
19566,Homer,look! there it is!
19570,Homer,ow! oh! call work and tell 'em i won't be in tomorrow.
19572,Homer,oh yeah.
19574,Homer,"hey, pretzels!"
19577,Homer,"that means thank you, marge."
19582,Homer,"oh, i guess i should speak to the executor of his estate."
19583,Homer,"you're my last hope. i've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. your help could make all the difference in the world."
19586,Homer,"yeah, my wife is raking it in."
19589,Homer,in those words? yes.
19590,Homer,how could i not? i saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. i saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into america's already bloated snack-hole. so i did what i could. i did what any loving husband would do: i reached out to some violent mobsters.
19593,Homer,now what?
19598,Homer,"hey, that's the fire alarm!"
19606,Homer,uh... yes sir. i thought i was supposed to.
19609,Homer,uh-oh.
19623,Homer,"use it wisely, my friend."
19626,Homer,no. there's no way out.
19629,Homer,i think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
19632,Homer,so what?
19641,Homer,burnsie!
19645,Homer,"marge, get me a beer."
19648,Homer,eww.
19653,Homer,"marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
19664,Homer,you have my undivided attention.
19666,Homer,and one who will work for minimum wage--
19667,Homer,did you say mary pop--
19673,Homer,"oh yeah. so, you worked for carl, eh?"
19674,Homer,"ooh, she is tough."
19675,Homer,i'll say. her butt waxed the banister.
19693,Homer,i do not!
19703,Homer,you? but you're a lady.
19707,Homer,"i'll field this one. let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""genius at work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
19709,Homer,quiet! you're missing the jokes!
19713,Homer,i'm the worst poochie ever.
19719,Homer,"you can't just kill off a classic tv character. poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. that's why i'm gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands."
19738,Homer,"oh. i'll just be another minute, john. have a seat."
19760,Homer,"look, john, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. just stay the hell away from my family!"
19761,Homer,no.
19764,Homer,"yeah! and that's another thing! i resent ""you people"" using that word. that's our word for making fun of you. we need it! well, i'm taking back our word and i'm taking back my son!"
19767,Homer,just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. father and son.
19768,Homer,"just remember, son, whatever happens --i'll always love you."
19772,Homer,that's a good start. let's get you a pack. what's your brand?
19780,Homer,"oh, my god, what's happening now?"
19786,Homer,it just does! name me one gay indian!
19803,Homer,what the -- ?
19807,Homer,"hey, we owe this guy. and i don't want you calling him a sissy. this guy's a fruit! and a -- no, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" queer, queer. that's what you like to be called, right?"
19812,Homer,"your mother's right, bart. sure, you're the one who ruined all of sideshow bob's criminal schemes --"
19821,Homer,"you like parties, huh? well, i just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
19829,Homer,"take it like a man, boy. and do everything your little sister says."
19835,Homer,"wow, even moe's moved to fancy new digs."
19855,Homer,"we're going out, marge. if we don't come back, avenge our deaths."
19857,Homer,"heh, rex banner. what a dope."
19861,Homer,"before! before! you're living in the past, marge! quit living in the past."
19872,Homer,won't.
19874,Homer,call me beer baron.
19875,Homer,but i can't be out of beer. i'm the beer baron!
19876,Homer,"sorry, i'm all out. wha-- how about some turpentine? or caulk? delicious caulk..."
19884,Homer,"what, dear?"
19889,Homer,"i thought about what you said, honey, and i've decided to quit."
19893,Homer,poor wiggum.
19894,Homer,"i'll bet you really hate rex banner, huh?"
19895,Homer,the guy who took your job.
19899,Homer,"aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
19901,Homer,"well, sorry, i'm not in that business anymore."
19912,Homer,"yes! my precious ""cartoons!"" ""who pumped ethyl?!"""
19932,Homer,you gave both dogs away?! you know how i feel about giving!
19933,Homer,"there, there, shut up, boy. we'll just get you a new dog."
19934,Homer,"well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. so you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
19948,Homer,"you're welcome, honey."
19950,Homer,lisa! you have a guest!
19954,Homer,"please be flanders, please be flanders, please be flanders..."
19957,Homer,uh-huh.
19970,Homer,"hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
19974,Homer,why would you volunteer at the church?
19977,Homer,"akira, can you read this for me?"
19987,Homer,"that didn't explain anything. all i know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". there's no other explanation."
20004,Homer,huh?
20011,Homer,"acid, eh? gee, that would have been stupid. boy would my face have been red!"
20015,Homer,okay. do i have to do anything?
20027,Homer,"... and our beautiful baby. my daughter, lisa -- i.q. 156."

20064,Homer,"no... candy! sweet, sweet candy."
20066,Homer,i want candy!
20071,Homer,not very.
20077,Homer,leggo my leg.
20084,Homer,"well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to disneyland for real!"
20098,Homer,"anyhow, i must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing i knew, i was running for my life."
20105,Homer,"now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. so if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the ozarks."
20115,Homer,come on! pick up the pace!
20118,Homer,getting closer... closer...almost there... ow!
20121,Homer,geez! that's just... awful!
20123,Homer,blech! eww! geesh! i'll take a crab juice.

20172,Homer,"mister, we could use a man like sheriff lobo again."
20173,Homer,disco duck and fleetwood mac...
20179,Homer,"aw, lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
20187,Homer,"and that, my children, is the story of bart's first day of school."
20212,Homer,ohhh. so hottt.
20213,Homer,"uh-uh. forget it marge. there is no way i am spending my saturdays at a museum. unless... museums don't have foosball, do they?"
20221,Homer,mmmm... re-circulated air.
20223,Homer,"well, i admit it looks bad, flanders, but haven't you heard of ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
20233,Homer,"oh, i'll take it."
20237,Homer,"ohhhh, but marge! am i doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?"
20248,Homer,you should be.
20249,Homer,"blankets, radio... oh, a gary larson calendar. i don't get it. i don't get it. i don't get it. i don't get it. i--don't get it."

20275,Homer,"okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
20281,Homer,"man, how'd i live without this thing?"
20286,Homer,i think she's right. the pants are a dead giveaway.
20287,Homer,"so then lenny says, ""as if! don't even go there, sister."""
20289,Homer,"eh, it'll turn up somewhere."
20294,Homer,"well, we were lucky this time. but it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with."
20303,Homer,"c'mon, give us some candy. don't pretend you're not home!"
20307,Homer,woo hoo!
20312,Homer,all done.

21159,Homer,"helper monkey, eh?"
21160,Homer,"i'd like a monkey, please. and maybe one of those dogs. what do they do?"
21170,Homer,marge! the kids are on!
21179,Homer,"mojo, will you wipe my mouth?"
21183,Homer,they didn't have lord huggington?
21187,Homer,"yes, but the memories will last a lifetime."
21190,Homer,"ooh, but i can rebuild!"
21194,Homer,"you guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! yeah, i'm talkin' to you! you trash-eatin' stink bags!"
21196,Homer,i don't know. a lot of people were yelling stuff.
21199,Homer,"hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men."
21206,Homer,"so-ho, the rats seem happy."
21228,Homer,"hey, vote simpson... hi... nice to see ya... heh, thanks for comin' out... keep puttin' on weight, huh? lenny, my man."
21230,Homer,these old geezers just don't get it. it's time to rock the vote.
21236,Homer,"ow! oh, bono! help me!"
21251,Homer,who should handle all your dirty jobs?
21252,Homer,i'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. i'm sure he had more important things to do.
21261,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ray. are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?"
21264,Homer,"jean-paul, how are the new uniforms? do they match the suede boots? beautiful. did you get the new trucks? are they amphibious? well, there's only one way to find out. we can always buy more."
21267,Homer,who can take your trash out? / stomp it down for you? / shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy too? / the garbage man...
21269,Homer,patterson was right. i'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...
21271,Homer,"wait, shutup... i just thought of something!"
21281,Homer,nay!
21284,Homer,"yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
21288,Homer,"if god didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin."
21292,Homer,flanders is playing? why didn't you say so?
21293,Homer,i agree. let's surrender.
21297,Homer,"oh, stop it!"
21305,Homer,"look, son. daddy got in shape. e--"
21306,Homer,"i've got to keep trying! or i could just move that picture. no! the picture looked good where it was. boy, drag me back outside."
21308,Homer,"hey, these power sauce bars look pretty healthy."
21318,Homer,"no, not there."
21325,Homer,"you too, marge. if you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
21326,Homer,"sorry, i only eat food in bar form. when you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, i'm told. that's why i'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
21339,Homer,"well, yeah..."
21344,Homer,"so nobody believes i can do this, huh? well, my son does. and i'm not gonna let him down. i'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
21345,Homer,shut up. you are so fired.
21353,Homer,just a few feet more...
21362,Homer,"hey. wait a minute. i'm on the top. i actually did it. i climbed the unclimbable mountain! bow down before me, everyone! for i am your king!"
21370,Homer,eh. eh.
21372,Homer,hope this stuff holds.
21373,Homer,hello?
21377,Homer,two hundred dollars?! isn't there any other way?
21385,Homer,"oh, where is she?"
21387,Homer,"for god's sakes, my little girl is--"
21392,Homer,"excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?"
21394,Homer,this is no good. i've got to get up higher.
21406,Homer,don't ever say that.
21408,Homer,"stupid risks are what make life worth living. now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. but me, i'm a risk taker. and that's why i have so many adventures."
21415,Homer,uh... not this exquisite.
21416,Homer,"well, daddy will figure it out."
21419,Homer,"anytime, honey. just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. now let's get home before your mother kills us."
21437,Homer,all right. how's that?
21439,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
21442,Homer,ahh!
21444,Homer,he's the best boy!
21448,Homer,"hmm, that's queer."
21452,Homer,okay.
21454,Homer,"eh, i never thought i'd live this long."
21455,Homer,"i'll get us out of this, honey. it's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'."
21456,Homer,hmmm...
21458,Homer,shhh. we're trespassing. and some of these farmers have pitchforks.
21463,Homer,"no, no, honey. maybe this will help."
21468,Homer,are you ready to rock? 'cause heeere we go!
21470,Homer,"well, yeah, kinda..."
21472,Homer,mine too. just like back in that hay loft.
21483,Homer,"oh, why can't they just play through?"
21495,Homer,"i'm okay, honey. now listen very carefully. i want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing."
21496,Homer,"no, that was not the thing."
21503,Homer,can't you just write on your arm like i do?
21507,Homer,people buy grease?
21508,Homer,"used grease is worth money? then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. i'm rich, apu! rich, i--!"
21512,Homer,looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
21514,Homer,"no, through savings and wise investments. of course with grease!"
21515,Homer,where do you think you're goin'?
21517,Homer,"okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off."
21536,Homer,"all right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. let's bow our heads in prayer."
21543,Homer,what is it?
21553,Homer,that's my grease! it's mine! give it here!
21563,Homer,"i've wasted half my life, marge. do you know how many memories i have? three! standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. thirty-eight years and that's all i have to show for it."
21565,Homer,oh. i see you're having a party. i'll come back later.
21568,Homer,no.
21579,Homer,"no, not this one. ""the smugglers of pirate cove."" it's about pirates."
21583,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, lenny. but here's one that's even more spellbinding. once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison. and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph..."
21584,Homer,"... and he was a firm believer in fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was alva. and he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. and..."
21591,Homer,"from this day forward, i am an inventor!"
21593,Homer,"yes, you did. i remember your exact words. you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
21595,Homer,let's see now... inventions... inventions...
21600,Homer,yes. thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
21601,Homer,shutup.
21607,Homer,"okay, we own 'em."
21608,Homer,"ohhh, it's no use. i can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community."
21617,Homer,probably needs to be more powerful.
21621,Homer,"but it does break easily. now this next one's for the ladies. how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?"
21625,Homer,"oh, look what you did. now i have to get my cold cream gun."
21628,Homer,"sure! believe me, every man in america will want to have one."
21629,Homer,yes?
21630,Homer,yes? yes? yes?
21632,Homer,but this is the best i could do. i guess i'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson.
21649,Homer,"outta the way. this is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!"
21655,Homer,"oh. well then, we'll take it out on eli whitney."
21659,Homer,"mail call! gather 'round, everyone!"
21667,Homer,nah. they mess up my hair.
21678,Homer,"it's okay, marge. i'll get him. ba-art!"
21689,Homer,why is this taking so long? bart was born in about five minutes.
21691,Homer,i see a horn!
21694,Homer,enough bickering. i know how to settle this.
21700,Homer,"this is legal, right?"
21703,Homer,you sent me to the chair.
21710,Homer,there. now no murderers can get in... or out.
21716,Homer,but i love my son.
21719,Homer,nooooo!
21725,Homer,"it wasn't me, it was the hair!"
21732,Homer,look at him go.
21736,Homer,i know how to cheer you up.
21740,Homer,all right. i got it. come on. get... off the...
21749,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. let's go home."
21755,Homer,"screw this. hang on, everyone. we're takin' the ol' simpson shortcut."
21759,Homer,i see it.
21761,Homer,lower! lower!
21767,Homer,life jackets?
21768,Homer,tow rope?
21778,Homer,"oh, this is not good."
21779,Homer,"aw, nuts."
21783,Homer,"well, i am a married man..."
21804,Homer,"nothing, nothing. i'm just broadening my horizons. uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a humvee?"
21825,Homer,so you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
21826,Homer,"well, if alec is out, i'm out too. you're on your own, potsie."
21828,Homer,"oh, i can't. i promised i wouldn't."
21830,Homer,"all right, i'm gonna let you guys in on something. but you've got to keep it much more secret than i did."
21839,Homer,"oh, how could alec and kim just cut me out of their lives?"
21840,Homer,"when kim makes a manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. and would it kill you to put some fennel in it?"
21846,Homer,attention starstruck fools!
21852,Homer,"ooh, look at me! i'm kim basinger, the big movie star! i'm so beautiful! i think i'm so great! i'm too important to take homer to the oscars."
21857,Homer,"okay, i'll stop."
21858,Homer,"yes, i do."
21862,Homer,"all righty, i'll just-- you stinkin' g--"
21865,Homer,"oh, am i?"
21867,Homer,"well, that settles it. for all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... line."
21868,Homer,nuclear power.
21872,Homer,"i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge. it chose me. i'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. now help me make up some phony credits."
21873,Homer,good. good.
21875,Homer,but i can't ask mom. she's on the run from the law.
21879,Homer,"wow, look at this place. there's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... i can actually feel the good vibrations."
21885,Homer,"oh, my god! my middle name is right behind that shrub. i'll finally know what ""j"" stands for! from this moment forth, i will be known as homer...jay simpson. it's so beautiful. what a magical gift for my mother to leave me."
21894,Homer,"why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? marge, you've got too many hang-ups. like the whole shaving trip. c'mon, i want to see those legs all furry and gross."
21902,Homer,what is this place?
21905,Homer,"look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. c'mon, where's your freak bus?"
21924,Homer,perhaps in time.
21926,Homer,"well, i do walk through pretty much anything... ohh, you kids are sweet."
21929,Homer,"good morning, starshine. seth."
21930,Homer,"i picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. your business is saved!"
21931,Homer,heh. that's what i thought at first. but then i found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
21932,Homer,"well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!"
21939,Homer,and peace.
21950,Homer,hurry up. my hands are getting cold.
21953,Homer,"hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? oh, i can't afford that."
21956,Homer,i'm way ahead of you.
21962,Homer,"eat, eat! you're nothing but skin and bones."
21966,Homer,"c'mon, boy, dig in. they'll give you a big, strong thorax."
21973,Homer,"but marge, look at the little guy!"
21974,Homer,"feel that, marge? he likes you!"
21977,Homer,we're not eating mr. pinchy. he's part of the family now.
21980,Homer,"aren't you proud of your big sister, mr. pinchy? hmm? hmm?"
21986,Homer,"sorry, marge. pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. but don't worry. i put him in a nice hot bath."
21988,Homer,"oh, man, that's good. pass the butter."
21990,Homer,"oh god, that's tasty. i wish pinchy were here to enjoy this. ohhh, pinchy!"
21996,Homer,two hours? why'd they build this ghost town so far away?
22007,Homer,f. murray abraham.
22009,Homer,"what are you, an animal?"
22012,Homer,"we're almost home, dad. only a couple more times over the horizon."
22014,Homer,"yep, that's what happens when you get older. it's one of those natural things. beautiful in its way."
22020,Homer,"i said ""fine."" what is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
22026,Homer,"it's not an operation, moe. the doctor says it's just a procedure."
22030,Homer,but i don't want that.
22035,Homer,i owe dad so much. those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
22038,Homer,that's my girl.
22039,Homer,liability waiver?
22047,Homer,"uh, excuse me, i'm fleeing in shame and i'd like to look my best."
22050,Homer,a tramp steamer! that's perfect!
22051,Homer,"oh, i'd like to apply for a job. any job. if you don't have a captain, i could be that."
22052,Homer,i've been on that one. the taffy shop.
22053,Homer,"the name on the back says ""honeybunch."""
22058,Homer,forget what?
22068,Homer,"boy, that..."
22077,Homer,hmmm...
22078,Homer,"yesss, tickling."
22080,Homer,"well, beats work."
22097,Homer,nooo!
22102,Homer,access denied.
22120,Homer,"and to think, i respected you! and defended you! you wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
22122,Homer,"oh my god, i killed the mayor. all right, stay calm. i'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""weekend at bernie's,"" and..."
22125,Homer,"you're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. now promise, or i'll let you fall to your death."
22127,Homer,"relax, you're in good hands. now come on, i'll pull you up."
22129,Homer,"oh, don't worry about that, boy. he's already out on bail. well, i'm off to work."
22135,Homer,"uh, excuse me..."
22140,Homer,"mayor, fat tony asked me to give you this--"
22145,Homer,"that guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
22147,Homer,look out!
22148,Homer,gimme that knife!
22152,Homer,"ohh, i'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent."
22156,Homer,"oh, i can explain that. you see..."
22158,Homer,"eat my dust, dust!"
22161,Homer,"hey, that's great."
22164,Homer,hey! how did churchy la femme get half price?
22170,Homer,now i'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
22173,Homer,you mean that one with the red paint?
22174,Homer,"geez, flanders. you're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
22176,Homer,fire in the hole!
22177,Homer,"okay, no more gasoline."
22179,Homer,"you got that right. throw on the mesquite, bart!"
22183,Homer,let's do it.
22190,Homer,gimme that!
22194,Homer,we're going to break the bank at the monty burns casino!
22198,Homer,"""nobody's goin' to take my ned / i'll teach him to have fu-un / ooh, he's a flanders machine..."""
22199,Homer,"relax, i called her from the gas station."
22207,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll figure it out. this isn't rocket science."
22209,Homer,"hey flanders, don't spill my beer!"
22210,Homer,"okey-doke, let's hit the tables."
22213,Homer,"seven, eh?"
22216,Homer,"well, there you go. now how 'bout a drink?"
22222,Homer,"and for you, ned?"
22230,Homer,"wait a minute. this could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. we would remember if we got married."
22232,Homer,what did you call me?
22237,Homer,"are you sure? oh, rats. no offense, sweetie."
22239,Homer,"i don't know, flanders, having two wives could have its advantages."
22245,Homer,"blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. the program is rock solid. the program is sound."
22246,Homer,"oh, those awful women want their omelettes."
22253,Homer,"but amber, i can change!"
22254,Homer,"all right, let's get our stories straight for marge and maude. we were out buying them fabulous gifts..."
22258,Homer,would you rather tell maude the truth?
22264,Homer,"because, i loved them once and they broke my heart. let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
22266,Homer,i'm going to warm up the car.
22272,Homer,"you'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens."
22274,Homer,shut it off. they're losers.
22275,Homer,championship?
22278,Homer,they lost? those losers!
22285,Homer,whoop! careful.
22290,Homer,"that was cold-blooded, marge."
22302,Homer,"speak for yourself! bart, get down here! i'm gonna spank you back to the stone age!"
22307,Homer,"wow, a val-u-qual coupon book!"
22309,Homer,"yeah, but there's two!"
22313,Homer,passing out in the ocean...
22317,Homer,really?
22321,Homer,stem lube. even i didn't fall for that... although winter is coming...
22323,Homer,yeah. i'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.
22327,Homer,me?!
22331,Homer,"c'mon, lenny. i just need four more guys to fill my super bowl bus. whaddaya say?"
22334,Homer,"oh, c'mon!..."
22336,Homer,"yeah, yeah. do we have any pencils that work?"
22339,Homer,"what is it, rudy?"
22342,Homer,"okay, dan. fire away."
22351,Homer,"please, my friends... ow! all right, i'll get you into to the game!"
22357,Homer,we can still make the kickoff!
22359,Homer,"oh, we're never gonna get out of... psst, cleaning lady. would you let us out of here?"
22360,Homer,i didn't ask for your life story. just give me the key.
22361,Homer,"man, that's gonna be some show."
22363,Homer,you guys are following me? i was following flanders.
22372,Homer,"ow! oh! all right, lovejoy! you're gonna get it."
22379,Homer,"oh, i can't wait. look, marge, i had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
22385,Homer,he's named like my name!
22388,Homer,"y'ello... yes, this is the original homer simpson. who's this?... the debbie pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... yes, i'm still available."
22399,Homer,"gentlemen, i bid you--"
22402,Homer,that does it! there's only one thing i can do.
22404,Homer,"well, i'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about..."
22406,Homer,"fine. i'll be in the car, driving home."
22408,Homer,"c'mon, people. enough is enough."
22419,Homer,i'm begging you. i'm a human being. let me have my dignity back.
22422,Homer,any of these will be fine.
22426,Homer,"oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off."
22437,Homer,"homer sim-- uh, max power."
22439,Homer,"yeah, but i usually have three or four."
22442,Homer,when trent steel bought me some.
22453,Homer,uh-oh. here comes lorne michaels. pretend you don't see him.
22456,Homer,"well, i spend a lot of time on the couch..."
22459,Homer,whuh?!
22464,Homer,"oh, this is the worst party ever."
22465,Homer,"oh, marge. i thought it would be fun to be on springfield's ""a"" list, but these people are nuts."
22467,Homer,"that's what i'm saying! see marge, this guy gets it."
22471,Homer,eep! leave me alone! go swab begley. he likes it!
22474,Homer,"so, trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
22478,Homer,chesty larue.
22482,Homer,"and then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. but the evil ogre, barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. so the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
22485,Homer,"hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" eh."
22487,Homer,"oh, don't make me choose."
22492,Homer,"hey, they stole our idea! see, look!"
22495,Homer,"mornin', apu. still in hot water with the squaw?"
22496,Homer,"oh, she's not gonna leave you right before valentine's day. that'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash."
22504,Homer,"well, don't just gasp, read it."
22505,Homer,i used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
22506,Homer,"we sold it, didn't we?"
22516,Homer,"c'mon, apu. make your move."
22518,Homer,let's roll.
22522,Homer,"oh, baby. we got him now. there's no escape from the airport."

22543,Homer,i saw krabappel's butt. i paid.
22556,Homer,where's your keys? i'm takin' your car to work.
22569,Homer,"don't worry, honey. daddy will fix that broken animal."
22570,Homer,i'm not gonna hurt him. i'm just gonna wake him up.
22571,Homer,"uh-oh. here's your slingshot, lisa."
22576,Homer,"ohhh, when will detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?"
22579,Homer,who's out there?!
22583,Homer,"ah, give me a minute..."
22590,Homer,shut up! you haven't even been born yet.
22591,Homer,"oh boy, am i glad to see you guys."
22594,Homer,okay.
22597,Homer,what's your favorite radio station?
22603,Homer,"go ahead, sweetie."
22616,Homer,"finally, a company that understands my needs."
22627,Homer,"that's right, ""the odd couple."" so meet your comically mismatched roommate, bart simpson."
22629,Homer,great. i'm gonna eat mayonnaise!
22633,Homer,"hey, that looks like fun."
22634,Homer,"you're on! lisa, you play winner."

22716,Homer,"relax, boy. we're ahead of schedule."

22781,Homer,"hey, now let's not do anything rash... god is love, right?"
22784,Homer,this sucks. things were so much better back in the garden.
22791,Homer,you put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / you put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...
22792,Homer,you throw da can away...
22794,Homer,"marge, i'm out of beer."
22795,Homer,"but, marge, i'm not like other men. that's why you buy my pants at that special store."
22797,Homer,can you?
22805,Homer,we can all burn evidence in it.
22806,Homer,"there, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?"
22807,Homer,"okay, sweetie. daddy'll take over."
22813,Homer,"english side ruined! must use french instructions! ""le grille?"" what the hell is that?!"
22814,Homer,come on... fit you...

22832,Homer,this lady says i'm an artist.
22839,Homer,"i think i remember my own life, marge."
22840,Homer,"astrid said the key to my art is anger. but you know me, i'm mister mellow."
22844,Homer,"what do we owe you, moe?"
22866,Homer,"ow! oh no, i'm being erased!"

22896,Homer,"no, i'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. you'll always be the artist in the family."
22898,Homer,and is that us on the roof?
22910,Homer,"to you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover."
22911,Homer,he says what we're all thinking.
22918,Homer,"boy, lenny, you sure look hungry. have some nuts."
22921,Homer,"welcome to the kitchen of tomorrow today! marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?"
22926,Homer,but you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow! ta-daa!
22937,Homer,"pew, well, i dodged a bullet."

22964,Homer,"hey, willie. that old couple looks just like you."
22971,Homer,no way! aberdeen rules!
22975,Homer,"so what do we do with our friend here? uh, throw him in the dumpster?"

22995,Homer,"hello, i have a certificate for a free erotic photo session."
22996,Homer,uh... geraldo... simpson.
22999,Homer,"well, i don't, but the block association seems to. they wanted a ""traditional"" santa claus."
23004,Homer,now you're sure this will save my marriage?
23006,Homer,"okay, i think he's gone."
23009,Homer,it's time to get homer-erotic.
23010,Homer,"maarge. oh, maaarge."
23015,Homer,"yeah, so? come on! more kissing!"
23020,Homer,i am.
23021,Homer,wow. i can't believe someone i never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
23022,Homer,"yes, i did."
23024,Homer,"hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""weird"" was here?! i love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."
23037,Homer,they're years ahead of us.
23040,Homer,go on...
23042,Homer,there's only three left in the world!
23045,Homer,"sure, by their standards, but we live in america."
23048,Homer,"a little late for ""could've's,"" marge."
23049,Homer,"no, mon, let's go home to jamaica. i and i been in babylon too long."
23051,Homer,"oh, so flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?"
23055,Homer,what? the guy who washes the elephants is japanese. his name is takashi. he's in my book club.
23062,Homer,"oh, all right."
23077,Homer,"like we say in my country, ""hasta la vista, baby."""
23080,Homer,thank god. i couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
23083,Homer,"don't worry, ichiban. i'll show you something japanese."
23104,Homer,"hello, i, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos."
23107,Homer,"relax, we're in an electric car."
23108,Homer,see? everything's fine.
23111,Homer,"hi, girls."
23118,Homer,who else is in it?
23119,Homer,"mel gibson is just a guy, marge. no different than me or lenny."
23123,Homer,i will now.
23143,Homer,"a mini-van... oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. what is this? toyota previa?"
23152,Homer,ah-ah-ah! now here's your biggest problem of all...
23155,Homer,it was symbolism. he was mad.
23161,Homer,...with a vengeance!
23162,Homer,those movies sucked. i only saw 'em to get marge into the sack. ps: mission accomplished.
23165,Homer,we'll talk.
23174,Homer,"quick, mel, get in!"
23185,Homer,i think so.
23194,Homer,"hey, what about a prequel to something? everybody loves prequels."
23195,Homer,"okay, mr. difficult. how about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
23204,Homer,i'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.
23207,Homer,some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
23209,Homer,andy dick...
23211,Homer,why you little...!
23216,Homer,now--
23220,Homer,"well, i have been thinking about making them into cut-offs..."
23225,Homer,and look at this. a cheese grater!
23234,Homer,"well, sure, if it's true."
23241,Homer,he quit blinking. he says that's when they get ya.
23243,Homer,uh-oh. somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
23245,Homer,"we should have paid more attention to these side-effects. it's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
23249,Homer,"my god, is she brave. standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
23264,Homer,"oh, i like food all right."
23268,Homer,"no, it usually takes a few hours."
23272,Homer,what's wrong with it?
23275,Homer,still not clean! stink of failure still on me!
23276,Homer,still not clean! still not clean!
23288,Homer,"can ya believe it, marge? this job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!"
23294,Homer,and the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
23298,Homer,"why, you... you made them cancel ""platypus man!"""
23299,Homer,and the cosby mysteries! that show had limitless possibilities!
23308,Homer,always.
23320,Homer,"sucks! that's great. ""and the bread was really..."" c'mon, help me out here."
23329,Homer,pedestrian.
23332,Homer,"oh, so full... bellybutton moving from innie to outie..."
23334,Homer,"eh, i've had a good run."
23337,Homer,"oh, lisa, the important thing is, i didn't get my comeuppance, and i never will."
23358,Homer,"hey, we just got away with murder. and it was so easy."
23360,Homer,but you got to kill...
23368,Homer,and i'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
23371,Homer,guess i forgot to put the fog lights in...
23377,Homer,doin' what now?
23378,Homer,"that can't be true, honey. if it were, i'd be terrified."
23379,Homer,uh-oh.
23385,Homer,"wonders, lisa? or blunders?"
23387,Homer,"thank you, sweet clown."
23397,Homer,i can't believe i destroyed the earth.
23408,Homer,"you're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
23411,Homer,sh-sh-shh!
23417,Homer,"uh, uh. ""h"" is for homer."
23418,Homer,heavyset? what's that supposed to mean?
23426,Homer,aisle six?
23434,Homer,"oh marge, that's in the past. just let it go."
23438,Homer,"ah, screw it."
23439,Homer,ooh! how 'bout that house?
23442,Homer,"come on, move it!"
23445,Homer,zo-rrooo!
23455,Homer,"all right, let's see what the old girl can do."
23460,Homer,this car was made in guatemala.
23472,Homer,"oh, it's been a month. why won't anything grow?"
23477,Homer,"oh, you're right. i'm a coward. i've made such a mess of things. if only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
23487,Homer,"that's all it takes. if we learned one thing from ""the amazing colossal man,"" and ""grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
23493,Homer,oh... where are you?
23494,Homer,"oh, you're right. this farm's hopeless. why didn't i listen to those inbred hicks? i guess i'll just go hang myself in the barn."
23498,Homer,who cares what it is? it's growing! i've saved the farm!
23504,Homer,"yes, it's the latest craze. try some, won't you?"
23508,Homer,those dirty rotten...
23509,Homer,"i wish i could make a difference, lisa, but i'm just one man."
23514,Homer,we all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. the least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
23519,Homer,"look, a flying saucer!"
23522,Homer,"i agree, but how?"
23538,Homer,"oooh, where's waldo?"
23545,Homer,no! i can't get in trouble if i can't see you.
23556,Homer,what a rotten day!
23559,Homer,practice ball! practice ball!
23560,Homer,real real real real real!
23569,Homer,"thank you, bart's teacher. you know, kids, my teachers said i would never amount to anything. and until last week, they were dead right. but now i've achieved perfection."
23579,Homer,"dream on, drunky!"
23581,Homer,i 'unno... because you weren't cute anymore?
23587,Homer,"remember springfield, keep on swinging!"
23592,Homer,"lisa, i know what's going on here. they did it to jesus and now they're doing it to me."
23596,Homer,"marge, has my life peaked?"
23599,Homer,"i can't believe it, moe. the greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
23602,Homer,"well, world, this is it. you know, i always thought you'd die before me. but now as i prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking..."
23603,Homer,i wanna live!
23618,Homer,"where's mag-gie? where's mag-gie? hey, where is she?"
23633,Homer,"oh, current... too strong... i know! if i sink to the bottom i can run to the shore."
23634,Homer,maggie! call aquaman!
23635,Homer,"maggie, you're swimming! you swam out to save me."
23641,Homer,and that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.
23646,Homer,he's named after what he is.
23647,Homer,"yes, i will have the... pl_penlügen. and don't skimp on the d__dlemünch."
23648,Homer,"hey, apu, manjula. you guys are still married?"
23652,Homer,"whoa, too much information! thanks for the mental picture. why don't you tell us what you really think?"
23653,Homer,"could you be any more...? hel-lo! look, just give me some ice cream."
23658,Homer,really? on top and underneath?
23663,Homer,my mistake. stay in the moment.
23683,Homer,there... and... there...
23685,Homer,"please, mr. kidkill, look into your heart. i know these babies have a lifetime contract. but what if i put together an even better act for you? something sensational!"
23689,Homer,what an age we live in.
23690,Homer,i remember television!
23693,Homer,what an age we live in.
23695,Homer,"that's right, never!"
23698,Homer,"it's mine. finally, i've won the respect of my fellow... get away from it!"
23700,Homer,i don't know how.
23705,Homer,"i know, i know. just tune her out."
23713,Homer,"you can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the cobras."
23716,Homer,"and what if we don't, pops?"
23723,Homer,sorry.
23731,Homer,... and those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look i get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
23735,Homer,"now don't worry. i am gonna search high and low for your mother. but just in case i don't find her, i want you to contact this agency."
23736,Homer,i just don't want to be alone.
23737,Homer,"excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
23738,Homer,that's more like it. i'm looking for...
23739,Homer,i'll show you.
23751,Homer,go! go! go!
23762,Homer,sorry.
23769,Homer,"um, uh... mr. coleman, i've been thinking... my wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... aw, heck! would you like to spend christmas with us?"
23775,Homer,oh no you don't!
23776,Homer,"oh, precious heirlooms! daddy would never let them take you."
23777,Homer,oh. that was scary. we came this close to losing our spare christmas tree stand. you monster.
23780,Homer,woo hoo!
23792,Homer,you missed all the fun.
23793,Homer,i want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
23798,Homer,take that! woo! woo! h-hey! hey!

23846,Homer,"huh? springfield university homecoming! finally, a chance to relive my golden college years..."
23853,Homer,"... yeah, so because of me, all the dorms now have security phones."
23863,Homer,now who's the dean?
23866,Homer,easy... easy...
23867,Homer,too far.
23880,Homer,can't make a float without flowers.
23891,Homer,"wait! wait! i got a float too! listen up, 'cause i gotta explain a lot of it!"
23894,Homer,"oh, i only wanted to show my school spirit."
23900,Homer,"bart, do your thing!"
23903,Homer,wha...?!
23915,Homer,now i'm ready to hit the town.
23919,Homer,"oops, forgot to swirl it."
23923,Homer,"operator, get me thailand. t...i... and so on."
23924,Homer,"everybody. i found burnsie's address book. i called the new york yankees and told them to bunt, and then i called the queen of england and asked her how it was going, and then i..."
23928,Homer,"marge, you're right. we do have to have a party."
23931,Homer,and i looked so good on that box.
23940,Homer,woo hoo!
23961,Homer,agh! rope burns!
23964,Homer,"in the net, right?"
23973,Homer,"like these guys. and look at all these rich people here. not as rich as they should be of course. but still rich. all that big money. look at all of these. got all this money. i have lots of money. oh look at all the other people. oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. i should send a list of these names to the irs. i'm takin' 'em all down. oh, look at all the rich people. oh, look at the rich..."

23978,Homer,"why should i? did my country give me a parade? no, man! they spat at me and..."
23979,Homer,thanks. this closes the saddest chapter in american history.
23981,Homer,takin' care of business!
23983,Homer,"get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!"
23992,Homer,"but he'll bring us joy, marge. unlike all your silly gewgaws."
23995,Homer,"pearls, eh?"
24000,Homer,now for the actual horse whispering.
24006,Homer,he ran all the way here.
24008,Homer,"that horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
24017,Homer,what happened?!
24020,Homer,but you're respected athletes! you own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
24025,Homer,did that really happen? or was it just a wonderful dream?
24029,Homer,"i mean, i'll deal with those murderous trolls."
24032,Homer,hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-gotta-go!
24033,Homer,"nah, we're cool."
24050,Homer,"oh, how rude of me. my name is..."
24064,Homer,"i know, i know. it's never easy."
24069,Homer,"yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""i love you,"" or ""you're special."" you know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."
24072,Homer,"easy answer, eh?"
24075,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i don't.
24080,Homer,"well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape..."
24083,Homer,"ned flanswered, that is."
24086,Homer,and his own car? that's ned flanders.
24088,Homer,"hey, ned."
24090,Homer,ned does everything with class. whether he's punching in his atm code...or keeping clean in the shower...
24103,Homer,"marge, we're trying to help ned."
24105,Homer,"hey, i'm as surprised as you, but i've stumbled upon the most delicious british sit-com."
24107,Homer,the mother's the voice of reason.
24118,Homer,"that's it, boy! go get help!"
24120,Homer,"umm... it's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary."

24247,Homer,"i'm sorry about your face, moe."
24250,Homer,what?
24256,Homer,"sorry, son. although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the indian."
24262,Homer,"oh, i'm tired of giving you money. why can't you be more like lisa?"
24265,Homer,"well, i do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. oh, you can."

24284,Homer,"all i know is, i'm finally getting the support i need."
24291,Homer,"you wish. that's the stage we call ""professor barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. here's drunk."
24292,Homer,"marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... oh, it's just barney."

24306,Homer,okay...

24315,Homer,"stupid barney, thinks he's too good for me."
24322,Homer,that i will.
24329,Homer,"well, if it isn't little miss ""i'm not wasting my life anymore."" which he is."
24332,Homer,barney...

24336,Homer,"barney, no! don't!"
24337,Homer,no! you've gotta be sober for this. gimme that!
24338,Homer,"ugh, it's warm."
24340,Homer,gimme that!
24341,Homer,"i won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. i love you. let's not lose touch after graduation."
24347,Homer,i could do a lotta things if i had some money.
24349,Homer,it's not bad.
24350,Homer,...and three makes three.
24355,Homer,"""yes."" ""are you a good lover?"" ""yes."" oh, i'm doin' great!"
24366,Homer,"okay, non-smoker... add eight years. so according to this i'll live to be... 42! oh, that's horrible! i won't even live to see my children die!"
24368,Homer,"see?! and these quizzes are never wrong, marge. they're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business."
24369,Homer,no!
24376,Homer,why isn't my baby gaining weight?
24385,Homer,"now, this is living!"
24390,Homer,what? she's hilarious.

24434,Homer,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
24435,Homer,that's what we've been trying to tell you.
24437,Homer,arizona smells funny.
24439,Homer,talking while the tv's on can't be good for you.
24449,Homer,"oo, my favorite door."
24452,Homer,"less yappin', more zappin'."
24454,Homer,"yes, dear."
24455,Homer,"hey, we got a postcard from bart. ""dear mom and homer. i'm having fun."" aw, sounds like he's having fun."
24464,Homer,"i didn't think, i just acted."
24472,Homer,i didn't hit your precious table.
24473,Homer,"oh, that's just superstition."
24484,Homer,"run, marge, run! pump those crazy legs!"
24486,Homer,"i heard she mates with men, then eats them."
24490,Homer,everybody wanted a piece of us.
24495,Homer,aannnd action!
24499,Homer,mamma mia!
24504,Homer,"son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
24505,Homer,why you little...!
24510,Homer,i'm king of the world! woo hoo! woo hoo!
24511,Homer,"right about here, i realize something's wrong."
24512,Homer,"yep, there i go. then came the rocks. jagged rocks. hitting me with their jags."
24514,Homer,why did i take such punishment? let's just say that fame was like a drug. but what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
24522,Homer,"hey, hey, stop it!"
24531,Homer,hi!
24539,Homer,"eh, too much baggage. oo, my horoscope. taurus: ""today you will die."""
24544,Homer,stupid horoscope!
24549,Homer,"st. peter! woo hoo! got to heaven before you, flanders!"
24551,Homer,"i'm sorry, i didn't get the number of hours or good deeds."
24553,Homer,... gotta find a good deed.
24558,Homer,well i'll be damned.
24559,Homer,i am hooomer siiimpsonnn...
24569,Homer,"so long, kids. enjoy your new home! say hi to your other brother and sister."
24571,Homer,here's a better idea -- i know how we can replace those children.
24576,Homer,"mmmm, fish. oh no, that's me!"
24588,Homer,c'mon lads! let's drive them back to the ocean!
24612,Homer,why you little...
24614,Homer,"uh, i have a question, phoney."
24615,Homer,"quiet, honey. daddy's asking the man a question."
24621,Homer,"well, i..."
24622,Homer,"nice wiring, bart."
24628,Homer,"i reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
24629,Homer,new springfield rocks!
24653,Homer,"okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible..."
24656,Homer,i can't believe those traitors abandoned us. they couldn't take one lousy famine.
24660,Homer,"hey, maybe we could. but we'll need some liquid persuasion."
24662,Homer,uh...
24663,Homer,"huh? oh, right."
24665,Homer,"wow, the who!"
24676,Homer,"so, new springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? with our ample parking and daily who concerts."
24682,Homer,"well marge, looks like your insane experiment is over."
24685,Homer,"all right. ""open stuck drawer..."" all-righty."
24691,Homer,"and now, the grand finale... ""get lisa's jammed tape out of vcr."""
24701,Homer,okay.
24704,Homer,"fine, i'll just discuss heavenly matters. so, how's maude flanders doin' up there? she playin' the field? ooh... yeah, really? all those guys? amen."
24706,Homer,"well, i won't lie. fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. but i wouldn't trade it for anything. except for some mag wheels. oh, man, that would be sweet."
24712,Homer,"a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a-weem..."
24722,Homer,"well, that didn't work."
24726,Homer,ow! that bullet went in.
24727,Homer,"you want money? get a job, like your old man."
24728,Homer,"so, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?"
24732,Homer,i knew this day would come. the cows are taking back what's theirs.
24738,Homer,"no, i like to save the environment in my own way."
24743,Homer,"this is your fault, with your non-threatening bobby sherman-style good looks. no girl could resist your charms."
24750,Homer,"grieving father, comin' through..."
24751,Homer,"thanks for the beer, moe. but before lisa died, she made this tape that i think you should hear."
24759,Homer,run!
24762,Homer,fine. you want passion? i'll give you passion.
24766,Homer,which i spent on a novelty horn.
24781,Homer,at lenny? but he's a war hero!
24782,Homer,no!
24794,Homer,"here you are, my good man. and while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots."
24805,Homer,maybe for you. how come you didn't rescue me?
24810,Homer,i retract my statement.
24813,Homer,"aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should i do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? i better throw it in the garbage."
24818,Homer,"i'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. is this enough dirty, dirty money?"
24823,Homer,"ho, ho, ho, merry everyone!"
24824,Homer,what are you doing here? i told you i'm not your monkey anymore.
24830,Homer,let's just say lisa gave me an early christmas present. the gift of dignity.
24834,Homer,what's an e-mail?
24845,Homer,"hey lisa, check out my new computer!"
24847,Homer,"stupid pothole. don't worry, head. the computer will do our thinking now."
24853,Homer,hmmmmm.
24857,Homer,"here it is, everybody! the world's greatest website!"
24859,Homer,"no kiddin'. what do you think of my page, lisa? be honest. it's great, isn't it? go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
24864,Homer,that lousy pothole! why don't they fix it?
24872,Homer,no way! mr. x is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
24875,Homer,no!
24882,Homer,i love spying.
24885,Homer,nooo!
24886,Homer,i'm mr. x! gimme! gimme!
24895,Homer,that's a great idea! i'll make up some news!
24912,Homer,"all right, whatever."
24917,Homer,did you bring us here?
24922,Homer,but why?
24923,Homer,"of course! it's so simple... wait, no it's not. it's needlessly complicated."
24927,Homer,i'm tired of being drugged and gagged. there's gotta be a way to escaped.
24928,Homer,huh?
24932,Homer,attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
24951,Homer,what the hell is that?!
24956,Homer,"come on, pony up, flanders. the kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
24959,Homer,"i know, but which one?"
24967,Homer,who gave you all this money?
24972,Homer,i think you know the answer to that.
24980,Homer,"no, no. don't protect him. you'll work off that cake in the acid mines."
24981,Homer,"well, you're the mark."
24990,Homer,although if the right offer came along...
24992,Homer,"yes, son?"
24997,Homer,"now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man..."
25004,Homer,which one of you youngsters is abe simpson?
25006,Homer,he's dead.
25010,Homer,"what's your problem, sport? afraid to be rich?"
25017,Homer,"chief, i'd like to scare my son straight. could i show him a jail cell?"
25022,Homer,"lies got us into this mess, son. from now on it's honesty all the way."
25025,Homer,"uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
25034,Homer,"yes, exactly! no, no! i mean, the whole incident is hazy."
25040,Homer,nobody carjacked me. i tried to pull a con and got conned myself. and then i lied to you all! so did bart.
25046,Homer,"lenny, are you watching this?"
25052,Homer,i wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
25055,Homer,"one snow angel, comin' up."
25058,Homer,i 'unno... internet?
25060,Homer,"well, yeah."
25064,Homer,... i feel like makin' love / makin' love to you! / do do dooo / do do dooo.
25070,Homer,a hamster ball!
25073,Homer,you're the camel.
25074,Homer,"hey, this car's got cruise control."
25082,Homer,"wait a minute, was that cat making out with that mouse? 'cause if they were..."
25094,Homer,"i'd like to buy 500 shares of ""animotion, incorporated."""
25099,Homer,huh? what is this crap?
25100,Homer,"sleep tight, my beloved. you're my ticket out of this hellhole."
25101,Homer,sorry. our ticket out of this hellhole.
25116,Homer,dammit!
25120,Homer,"hey, i came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
25121,Homer,"hmmm. increase my killing power, eh? let's do it."
25126,Homer,"now, who's up for a trip to the library tomorrow? notice i no longer say ""liberry"" or ""tomorry""."
25130,Homer,"hey, flanders, headin' for church? well, i thought i could save you a little time."
25134,Homer,"not being a moron, i wouldn't know. however, ."
25138,Homer,i've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
25154,Homer,that's ridiculous. you do nothing but play god! and i think your octoparrot would agree.
25165,Homer,i'unno. must be sumpin' i wrote before moe fixed me.
25171,Homer,oh.
25180,Homer,"now, for a little calming blue."
25184,Homer,uh-huh.
25189,Homer,"well, there's a dull ache, certainly. and overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. only instead of bacon, there's agony. marge, can i have a blt?"
25199,Homer,"ow! owww, my back. dr. steve didn't do anything."
25201,Homer,yeah... in fact...
25202,Homer,i feel fantastic!
25206,Homer,"you brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
25210,Homer,not unless you think about the irony.
25211,Homer,"okay, that should do it, moe."
25219,Homer,you're gonna regret this.
25220,Homer,"wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals..."
25240,Homer,"hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out."
25242,Homer,what funny names.
25243,Homer,that thing got picture-in-picture?
25248,Homer,mr. salesman?
25249,Homer,we're gonna go with the wolves.
25255,Homer,"and if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all..."
25261,Homer,that seems about right.
25262,Homer,and it's bad news for the gophers.
25265,Homer,fas-ter.
25271,Homer,i've had it with that school!
25272,Homer,door.
25281,Homer,"good news, honey. i found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. i've entered us in a doubles tournament."
25282,Homer,"don't worry. the tournament's not till tomorrow. okay, get ready for the serve."
25285,Homer,"i'll be right out, honey."
25288,Homer,i'm getting to that.
25289,Homer,"lookin' good, honey. i think you and i might just win this tournament dealy."
25293,Homer,"well, i'm ready for the big tournament."
25296,Homer,it's gonna be tough without a partner.
25298,Homer,"good morning, partner!"
25300,Homer,"yes, darling?"
25306,Homer,"hello, marge."
25308,Homer,don't touch me. your hands feel like salad tongs.
25313,Homer,who pays for that wedding?
25317,Homer,badbye.
25334,Homer,"yeah, but only to crush my wife and son."
25338,Homer,"now lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. let's just say i'm replacing you."
25339,Homer,"okay, swing. run. hit the thing. now run across the..."
25351,Homer,"so, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
25354,Homer,what's on tv?
25357,Homer,take it off!
25359,Homer,"38! that's roughly my age! marge, after a lot of thought, i've decided to run the springfield marathon."
25360,Homer,"stay out of this, lisa. marge, i've made up my mind. i'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. then we'll see who has it tougher."
25361,Homer,"let's see. sweatbands... check. anti-chafing nipple tape... check, check... and check."
25368,Homer,yvan eht nioj. ya gotta love that crazy chorus.
25371,Homer,here comes the jealousy bug. gonna git ya! gonna git ya!
25375,Homer,"not ""mad""! that's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine."
25379,Homer,kids... how would you... like to go to... blockoland?!!
25380,Homer,but... the tv gave me the impression that...
25381,Homer,"maggie, no!"
25383,Homer,i am a robot. do what i say.
25387,Homer,i get it. everything's made of blocks. even the water.
25392,Homer,it's what i always tell them. i told them that twice yesterday. and then again as they were going to sleep.
25395,Homer,you sold my little girl a shoddy eiffel tower.
25397,Homer,"but before i go, i'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
25412,Homer,oops!
25414,Homer,"oh, really..."
25419,Homer,"and i gave that man directions, even though i didn't know the way. 'cause that's the kind of guy i am this week."
25433,Homer,wait a minute. will this erase my memory?
25438,Homer,...thank you for coming. the proof that the isotopes are moving to albuquerque is right behind this door.
25442,Homer,"so? i can stop. and i will stop. i'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
25450,Homer,they're secretly planning to move to albuquerque.
25453,Homer,"nice try, god."
25455,Homer,stop that!
25459,Homer,what?! that's not why i'm here!
25466,Homer,why do you look like cesar romero?
25467,Homer,why are you here?
25469,Homer,what's happening? did i crush your corporation?
25473,Homer,"tell the truth! c'mon, everybody!"
25475,Homer,the truth never tasted so good!
25477,Homer,"they said if i come in late again, i'm fired. i can't take that chance."
25490,Homer,mm hm. hmmmm.
25492,Homer,thank you.
25494,Homer,everybody was kung-fu fighting...
25497,Homer,that baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
25503,Homer,it...
25505,Homer,"oh. okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
25508,Homer,reach into these holes. i use a carrot.
25510,Homer,"of course you are. marge, i've finally discovered the reason god made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. and i've got to share that gift with the world."
25513,Homer,problem: a pointy deity. and i've got the perfect solution.
25518,Homer,you can dance / you can dance / everybody look at your pants.
25521,Homer,woo hoo! simpsons rule! sorry.
25526,Homer,"well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home."

25572,Homer,help! kitenge!
25573,Homer,good ol' kitenge.
25577,Homer,"okay, here's the situation: we're hopelessly lost and about to die."
25585,Homer,it's a flower.
25588,Homer,or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
25597,Homer,help! bad monkey!

25660,Homer,to heaven!
25665,Homer,"flanders has cooties, flanders has cooties."
25671,Homer,"yeah, maybe it was too soon."
25674,Homer,"yeah, a lifetime of memories."
25675,Homer,"sure, of course i do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth."
25682,Homer,"relax. it's a ""controlled burn""... uh-oh."
25683,Homer,"uh, yeah, teenagers."
25688,Homer,do i detect a hint of cinnamon?
25690,Homer,"i'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other godly hoo-hah."
25691,Homer,"oh, why not? everybody's doin' it."
25696,Homer,"ned, praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. look at those smiling faces."
25699,Homer,orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... lighting candles!
25705,Homer,"yes! losers! lo-sers! lo-sers! l-- you said ""homer,"" right?"
25717,Homer,jet-son!
25719,Homer,miss work? but my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.

25738,Homer,"hey, it was fun. my kids are sick of all my stories. but they just can't get enough of me!"
25739,Homer,don't tell me what i'm not doing.
25741,Homer,"then i'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
25742,Homer,that's the one.
25749,Homer,wonderful. being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. ya got any?
25753,Homer,"yes, but then i discovered the joys of raising children."
25754,Homer,"don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. then you'll know my joy."
25759,Homer,"hang on, everybody. three, two, one... blast off!"
25767,Homer,i'll mace you good!

25772,Homer,i almost had a straight!
25786,Homer,teamsters.
25794,Homer,"all right, but your next story better be worth it."
25802,Homer,i liked that story 'cause i was a judge.
25809,Homer,"ah, ethnictown. where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy, overfed americans."
25810,Homer,"wait, this is just a shaved puppy."
25812,Homer,"a fortune teller? oh, no you don't. this phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. see, this wart is a fake!"
25815,Homer,owww!

25857,Homer,i love our court days.
25859,Homer,i'll bring the car around.
25865,Homer,i couldn't agree more. perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
25870,Homer,i used to be.
25872,Homer,i'll medicate you...
25881,Homer,"i'm with you, son!"
25889,Homer,"oh, yeah... i forget things sometimes..."
25892,Homer,"i hit my head, moe."
25894,Homer,"all right, all right. come on, bart."
25897,Homer,"yeah, they're italian."

25906,Homer,why not? kids are very visual these days.
25909,Homer,ow! why you--!
25916,Homer,woo hoo!
25917,Homer,"heyyy, how 'bout that? ha, ha."
25925,Homer,"you know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. and you don't even have to say ""bad."" it could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
25930,Homer,"well, we tried all those other tools."
25941,Homer,"oh, it's just a friendly seal."
25950,Homer,probably digging for drugs.
25952,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll find out what he's up to. kids shouldn't have secrets."
25956,Homer,maybe i will.
25960,Homer,clear!
25961,Homer,this thing pays for itself.
25963,Homer,"you callin' me a liar, carl?"
25979,Homer,don't worry. you gotta hit it just right. like fonzie.
25984,Homer,"ooo, bart! my first prank call. what do i do?"
25990,Homer,you dirty teen.
25991,Homer,moe? wrecking moe's bar?
25993,Homer,"and it would look pretty, too."
26001,Homer,not for friends of moe's.
26007,Homer,"okay, look cool."
26011,Homer,"oh, so you're ashamed of us. well, you've turned into a big phony."
26012,Homer,"i'll throw myself out, thank you."
26016,Homer,it's not about spite. it's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor moe. now help me nail up this urinal.

26045,Homer,"and i'm thankful i get to spend thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."

26049,Homer,"oh, these fortunes are terrible."
26051,Homer,easy.
26053,Homer,"okay, let's see... ""the price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
26059,Homer,"oh. he ran his own casino, stole the loch ness monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun."
26060,Homer,"c'mon, he's a total player."
26064,Homer,these would stop joan collins herself.
26073,Homer,oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!
26080,Homer,you know what would be surprising? a foot massage.
26088,Homer,you mean a van dyke?

26183,Homer,a heavenly choir. you must be an angel!
26184,Homer,"no, you are an angel like denzel washington in ""the preacher's wife,"" or will smith in ""bagger vance,"" or slimer in ""ghostbusters."""
26191,Homer,"me. / right here. / oh, me too. / please."
26196,Homer,"okay, but talk like this."
26199,Homer,"oh, no! the roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
26206,Homer,"give it to me, baby."
26208,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. liquors drunkened me."
26224,Homer,"well, that's the last we'll see of them. come on, we're goin' to moe's."
26226,Homer,"you know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face."
26235,Homer,"no, the best book you've ever seen is tom clancy's ""op center."""
26237,Homer,i've used up all these records.
26238,Homer,that's a great idea. do you think i could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
26248,Homer,denver?
26249,Homer,fellow springfielders. i have called you all here so we can enter the duff book of world records.
26254,Homer,all right. i'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.
26256,Homer,wait a minute.
26257,Homer,ha! ha! we did it! springfield rules!
26259,Homer,"now that everyone's so open about being fat, i can finally stop sucking in my gut."
26263,Homer,it was dinner.
26264,Homer,i was hoping we could do that together.
26275,Homer,count fudge-ula? i thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
26284,Homer,no way! we'll defy you to the death!
26288,Homer,"that guy is freaky. well, here's your sugar."
26289,Homer,"oh, they both make such good arguments."

26307,Homer,my mouth. my beautiful mouth.
26311,Homer,i'm horny!
26314,Homer,i learned so much about my family. you'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
26315,Homer,i was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
26318,Homer,"well, as much as humanly possible."
26326,Homer,"yes, and i was merely reading the title: ""i'm gonna kill you."""
26329,Homer,i just poured myself a new glass of milk. the old one sat out for a little while. are you comin' to bed?
26330,Homer,"marge, i could stand here and argue with you, but then i'd have to get a new glass of milk. goodnight, honey."
26332,Homer,what?! nooo!
26339,Homer,looks like i need some fuel for me mule. gas for me ass.
26347,Homer,"it's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
26364,Homer,that's enough running.
26370,Homer,"my life here is over. lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?"
26371,Homer,then it's settled. we leave springfield forever.
26375,Homer,"just run the camera, you little..."
26389,Homer,"i gotta hand it to artie ziff, marge. that little nerd saved my life."
26390,Homer,"goodnight, honey."

26421,Homer,would a u.s. dollar change your mind?
26423,Homer,"listen to me, son. no one loves a quitter. so you go over there and you win her back."
26430,Homer,he's a good doggie!
26431,Homer,ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
26444,Homer,for shame!
26462,Homer,"the ""x"" is for extreme!"
26466,Homer,"sure, i said i loved him. but never that i was ""in love"" with him."
26467,Homer,"aw, dad... we've got what people never get, a second chance."
26469,Homer,you sunk my scrabbleship!
26473,Homer,that was a d.w.i.
26484,Homer,lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
26485,Homer,"straight up, marge. that hoochie only likes you because you can drive."
26488,Homer,cosmic.

26491,Homer,"oh, that is it! abraham j. simpson, you are never driving again!"
26493,Homer,"oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
26495,Homer,"uh, we'll wait for the next one."
26497,Homer,only in public.
26500,Homer,stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. piece of crap...
26508,Homer,trojans.
26509,Homer,"if i'm laughing at what i think i am, it's very funny. anyway... ""as night fell, the greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
26513,Homer,"boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!"
26514,Homer,almost home!
26515,Homer,"thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. guys?"
26523,Homer,"oh, i'm sorry i was gone so long. but i'm gonna do something i haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash."
26524,Homer,"sweet penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when i left."
26526,Homer,"oh, here's the story of joan of arc..."
26536,Homer,"son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. called ""ghostbusters."""
26539,Homer,"boy, did you make a prank call to brazil?"
26545,Homer,"ooo, fascinating."
26550,Homer,"free service, here we come."
26552,Homer,"okay, i'll try the green."
26558,Homer,"yeah, the one we both like."
26576,Homer,"i got it, i got, i got it."
26581,Homer,"now lisa, it's not as bleak as that. can you fly me over town to look for him?"
26585,Homer,check please.
26590,Homer,"okay boy, let's strut our stuff. i go to rio"") i'm in rio / and i'm walking on the beach / i'm in my speedo..."
26600,Homer,this corn doesn't look so big.
26601,Homer,what?!
26605,Homer,"so lisa says by killing their enemy, i became the alpha-crow."
26609,Homer,"drop it in, don't cram it in. oh, forget it, i'll do it myself."
26613,Homer,"okay, that was not cool. we need to lay down some ground rules--"
26614,Homer,"we'll get to that. right now, i think we need some time apart--"
26617,Homer,ow! ow!
26646,Homer,hardly working...
26648,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, i've got news for you. i just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""yes-i-cannabis."""
26650,Homer,look at shemp! he is so high!
26657,Homer,"so my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on tuesday the seventh..."
26661,Homer,"although, wow!"
26664,Homer,all right. i'll do it for my kids.
26673,Homer,but i can't find you funny anymore.
26692,Homer,my father and i were never really close.
26695,Homer,then came the day that changes every couple forever. the day we got our elephant.
26697,Homer,"ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
26711,Homer,lousy minor setback! this world sucks!
26730,Homer,i said anger.
26735,Homer,they call me mellow yellow... quite rightly! this fellow never bellows... quite rightly!
26738,Homer,dirty diapers on strings!
26739,Homer,time to put this ordeal behind me.

26770,Homer,"dirty love. i mean, thirty love. i mean, anyone for penis? i'll just get the shuttlecock."
26772,Homer,why don't you play this?
26774,Homer,he already knows. let's tell krusty.
26778,Homer,"...so anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
26783,Homer,"mmm, caramel baloney."
26785,Homer,you bet i am!
26789,Homer,this is going great.
26795,Homer,it's been on my list for a long time.
26806,Homer,i take a whiskey drink / i take a chocolate drink / and when i have to pee / i use the kitchen sink / i sing the song that reminds me i'm a urinating guy!
26809,Homer,now go to bed!

26839,Homer,"well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
26845,Homer,that's better.
26846,Homer,"thank god. i'm out of matches. oh no, here's another one."
26851,Homer,"yeah, i've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking."
26854,Homer,"hey, i'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- oh-ho-ho, you mean me? i'd be delighted."
26859,Homer,laxative?
26864,Homer,buh... guh... muh... wuh. zuh.

26877,Homer,"you know chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
26887,Homer,i knew it!
26890,Homer,i've made my choice.
26893,Homer,you know what will cool this place down? a little touch of winter.
26897,Homer,"oh, no! they're stealing the tire fire!"
26898,Homer,no.
26902,Homer,"you've got to set limits, marge."
26905,Homer,"i admit it. i did screw up, but i won't feel guilty until i can put a human face on this."
26915,Homer,"from ""the woolly bully."""
26917,Homer,to people?
26918,Homer,people with heads?
26923,Homer,"hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. and i felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
26925,Homer,"oh, well... heh, heh. hm... oh, i'll... no...."
26928,Homer,"fellas, i'm starting my own private police force. will you join me?"
26930,Homer,you'll do as i say or i'll have your badges. once i make and give you your badges.

26978,Homer,"wow, four of me. i think this could be a magic hammock. and it just might be the answer to my problems."
26980,Homer,uh-huh!
26993,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
26998,Homer,not mr. blasty?
27003,Homer,"hear me, people of the past!"
27007,Homer,"hey, i've been around scotsmen."
27015,Homer,"oh my god! she's become a monster! which i have to admit, i sort of suspected during the sex."
27030,Homer,you guys are nuts. all you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do i sign up?
27034,Homer,and you can live with that.
27038,Homer,"jewish? oh, no, i'm not jewish."
27044,Homer,i'm outta here...

27170,Homer,domiciles for the destitute? is this that thing that jimmy carter does?
27176,Homer,... and that's how my beautiful wife brought our son bart into the world.
27177,Homer,"sure, why not?"
27185,Homer,i fell off. hee hee hee.
27186,Homer,"yeah, he truly is a monster. hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. just you, me, the kids and the twins. whadaya say?"

27224,Homer,who wants to eat a loser?
27228,Homer,i'll teach you to whistle on the sabbath!
27232,Homer,"wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!"
27238,Homer,"you know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and maggie's in her cage..."

27245,Homer,"oh, i wish you would reconsider the proposal of hiram beatwife."
27247,Homer,lisa! explain!
27249,Homer,"you monsters! you've turned this show into a ""survivor"" clone."

27257,Homer,"wow. marge, i think i figured out their primitive language!"
27258,Homer,and now to wreck their precious helicopter.
27261,Homer,no more reality shows for us. let's watch some quality scripted television.
27268,Homer,perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
27272,Homer,don't struggle. you'll only sink faster.
27275,Homer,"mmm, steamed gentile."
27281,Homer,"hmm... well, there's mr. burns, fat tony, the emperor of japan, ex-president bush."

27338,Homer,who will take home the rampy?
27341,Homer,what a rip! you all should be ashamed!
27348,Homer,oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god.
27351,Homer,"eh, it's still better than indian food."
27354,Homer,"lisa's not gonna want that. oh, what can i get her?"
27355,Homer,what are you buying? jerk stuff?
27358,Homer,"well, yes and no."
27359,Homer,mostly no.
27365,Homer,"oh, lisa's still mad at me."
27378,Homer,it's one word.
27383,Homer,"wait, wait!"
27384,Homer,i thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
27406,Homer,"lisa, this is from your mom."
27408,Homer,the man who framed you is a crooked detective. who i hired!
27409,Homer,to find out everything about you so i'd seem like a good father.
27413,Homer,"oh, a banana!"
27417,Homer,"in retrospect, yes."
27424,Homer,yeah. but what's gonna happen to the animals?
27425,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i released them all into the wild."
27426,Homer,"why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
27438,Homer,your heartbeat is so soothing.

27457,Homer,"bart, eat your spinach."
27458,Homer,yes way!
27461,Homer,"no, actually, i'm going to eat twice as much."
27467,Homer,your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
27470,Homer,"oh, i'm so proud of you, honey. you bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity."
27471,Homer,"sorry, sir, sorry."
27472,Homer,denser?!

27490,Homer,"no that's not it. he's got some secret. and i'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes."
27494,Homer,"well, since i don't have the remote, i can just get up and change the channel."
27496,Homer,"o, merciful god, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."
27497,Homer,there it is.
27499,Homer,"it worked! i got my wish! from now on, i'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding."
27505,Homer,mmm. move over eggs. bacon just got a new best friend: fudge.
27521,Homer,it's all good.
27523,Homer,"the dog's on board, too."

27527,Homer,"i was made for loving you, baby / you were made for loving me..."
27528,Homer,"i can't get enough of you, baby..."
27534,Homer,"eh, god's cool."
27535,Homer,"oh look, god's giving us a little shower."
27537,Homer,"oh, wet and wonderful god, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. surely this has proven whatever point you had."
27540,Homer,it's such a mess. watch the teeth!
27550,Homer,"that's right. you're mine till you're eighteen. and when you're seventeen i'm gonna know the end is near, so i'm gonna work you like a dog."

27603,Homer,"wow, i can't wait to pack that into my colon."
27606,Homer,the ribwich! the commercials have come to pass!
27619,Homer,"maybe i should hook up with you guys. after all, how long do any of us have to live?"
27625,Homer,hey! don't borgnine my sandwich.
27628,Homer,"lisa? is this what i've come to? fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? mister, i'll take that car."
27630,Homer,damn right honey. you're number one on my menu. now super-size it!
27636,Homer,"i know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. there's the tongue-kissing festival... cinco de ocho... the hobo oscars... days just made for lovers. not widowers, lovers."
27638,Homer,ooh! lemme guess. skinner's mother. she sure knows how to swing it.
27648,Homer,"poor ned, gardening away his misery."
27656,Homer,i'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.

27668,Homer,i see a bad moon rising...
27673,Homer,bo-ring!
27675,Homer,"krusty, you've let everyone down. and even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
27677,Homer,from the unknown toaster.
27680,Homer,"sir, i studied under ed mcmahon!"

27691,Homer,"thanks for the love tip, ""60 minutes ii."""

27758,Homer,"unlike mr. burns, i will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. and now, as i ascend this crystal staircase to my office, i say: avert your gaze!"
27759,Homer,"that is so cool. bart, open the door."
27760,Homer,"now, open it again and put a walnut in there."
27764,Homer,i need a vacation.
27765,Homer,can't i water ski a little bit?
27773,Homer,"hey! that's a printer port, not a finger hole."
27775,Homer,bart's growing up without me. he won't be ten forever.
27783,Homer,"from now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest dad."
27792,Homer,"sweetie, daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
27801,Homer,hey mr. smithers!
27803,Homer,"i'unno. what am i, superdad?"
27806,Homer,aw... my baby's first words.
27817,Homer,now let's see. this is either an old coconut... or tom hayden.
27819,Homer,"prove me wrong, silent bob."
27820,Homer,looks like you're missing a wife.
27836,Homer,yeah.
27856,Homer,what a well-kept street. and there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
27860,Homer,"me too. i'm a member of this club where if i eat one more sub sandwich, i get a free sub sandwich. you probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."
27861,Homer,are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
27867,Homer,i see.
27874,Homer,"maybe it is. i used to look at marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see rip taylor. but now, i don't know what's gonna happen. c'mon, let's dance."
27877,Homer,did you ever get the parody songs i sent you?
27878,Homer,"which one was better: ""livin' la pizza loca"" or ""another one bites the crust""?"
27879,Homer,"yeah, like you and allan sherman."
27880,Homer,it would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
27888,Homer,i gotta go.
27892,Homer,"you know, moe, i was just thinking. my problems with marge started because i drink too much. and then tonight alcohol only made things worse. maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
27895,Homer,"so, she didn't hate me. she married me because she loved me!"
27899,Homer,those suck. they're worse than nothing. i could write way better songs.
27900,Homer,"that's it, i'm writing a christmas carol. if i can make my own clothes, i can do anything."
27901,Homer,christmas in december / wow wow wow / give me tons of presents / now now now!
27902,Homer,maybe.
27904,Homer,how am i supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... wait a minute...
27913,Homer,everybody hates that stupid jerk!
27923,Homer,those poor hats.
27928,Homer,three.
27929,Homer,deal. my brother...
27930,Homer,"all right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble native americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
27936,Homer,it's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. what are you gonna do?
27938,Homer,uh-oh! we forgot to empty the mini-bar!
27939,Homer,that's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
27942,Homer,fresca?!
27943,Homer,"look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats."
27945,Homer,a lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
27952,Homer,nothing beats flying across the country on a train.
27961,Homer,head burning... legs freezing. middle... very pleasant.
27966,Homer,move the net under the window.
27973,Homer,"kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog."
27979,Homer,corporate jet?
27980,Homer,sweet.
27981,Homer,"welcome back to the family, boy."
27995,Homer,"to me that says ""i love you."""
28004,Homer,"you can't just ""get"" a cell phone."
28009,Homer,black power! black power!
28019,Homer,i'll never mock the coast guard again. you navy rejects are all right!
28020,Homer,"i am so screwed. i can't drive to work, i can't drive to the store, and i certainly can't drive to the store at work."
28023,Homer,"thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, marge."
28025,Homer,public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. i guess i'll walk.
28027,Homer,i did it. i walked all the way to moe's from my house.
28028,Homer,"you know, i feel pretty good. maybe i should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar."
28034,Homer,"now now, honey. we all appreciate what you do. but real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. you could get in a lot of trouble with the livery commission."
28036,Homer,what a day for a stroll.
28043,Homer,you sure love driving.
28045,Homer,now it actually is a fanny pack.
28047,Homer,i like to walk down the avenue / bust a move with disco stu...
28051,Homer,i can walk from springfield to alaska / then hobnob with the stars in malibu...
28065,Homer,"who's ""we""? got a mouse in your purse?"
28066,Homer,nothing could be farther from the...
28075,Homer,"i'm gonna treat marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
28086,Homer,"you're welcome. and now marge, we cooked, you clean."
28090,Homer,i never knew you were such a beatles fan.
28092,Homer,"look at me, i'm brian epstein!"
28098,Homer,i will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
28100,Homer,"the noble chiefs outsmarted the treacherous cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. i shall bet no more forever."
28109,Homer,it's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
28123,Homer,flower power my ass.
28124,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
28129,Homer,"look, maggie's in the paper with moe. how cute."
28131,Homer,"oh my god, i'm late for work."
28134,Homer,"no way! i'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. but if i lose maggie, i'm oh-for-three. i've gotta get her back."
28140,Homer,your turn.
28143,Homer,"get your own family, moe."
28145,Homer,get out!
28150,Homer,"uh, no, that was me."
28163,Homer,nooooo!
28165,Homer,i'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
28166,Homer,"ooo, this robe's pretty soft."
28168,Homer,what? it's not... my hand! what's happening?
28169,Homer,"no way. forget it. i might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but i am not a grim reaper."
28177,Homer,"okay, who am i giving the finger to today?"
28179,Homer,uh... what was that first one again?
28186,Homer,"if i say no, do i still win?"
28190,Homer,it was those guys!
28199,Homer,"honey, this is your moment in the sun. and i couldn't be more pleased for your happiness."
28203,Homer,"okay, get ready to laugh!"
28207,Homer,"from what, too much hot fudge? huh? c'mon bart, show me some love!"
28210,Homer,world's biggest pizza?!
28213,Homer,i wish! look at this headline.
28215,Homer,wait a minute. this is today's paper. that meeting is tonight!
28231,Homer,fine.
28239,Homer,"dad, you testified against her!"
28246,Homer,how do you figure?
28253,Homer,awww.
28258,Homer,"take care, ladies. i'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own."
28261,Homer,"yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. but i'm not gonna leave you."
28262,Homer,"ooh, that's lucky."
28264,Homer,go mom! you can do it!
28272,Homer,"aw marge, i bet you've gotten that out of your system."
28278,Homer,i'd like to cash in these chips. give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
28282,Homer,"oh, what a delicious quiche! i drive a pink miata."
28284,Homer,my name is nelthon! i use a thalad fork. la-dee-dah! i wash my face!
28285,Homer,clothesline.
28287,Homer,"oh, i'm so confused."
28310,Homer,the place i was born is now a gator farm.
28320,Homer,"i understand the word ""gave."" unless it means something else in this country."
28325,Homer,"what? by saying ""macbeth""?"
28329,Homer,"yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
28330,Homer,i see an opening.
28333,Homer,"okay, let's see. oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
28334,Homer,"lady, please. get back in your overturned car. let the guys handle this."
28337,Homer,wait! we have to exchange insurance!
28339,Homer,"my lord, we americans love queens, be they homecoming or dairy. this woman, however, is an imposter."
28350,Homer,"sweet freedom, here i--"
28351,Homer,"boy, it's a good thing i'm leaving before i went nuts. goodbye sparkly elves."
28360,Homer,flow... yeah.
28363,Homer,"let's see, what would she like?"
28364,Homer,twenty on the trifecta?
28365,Homer,her wedding china back?
28372,Homer,"wow! i never thought i'd say this, but you slags are all right."
28377,Homer,"that's it, kids. suckle daddy's sugar ball."
28397,Homer,"no, go ahead."
28399,Homer,"you cowardly swede! you face that bear like a man, or i'll never speak to you again."
28403,Homer,"check it out, ladies. the suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
28407,Homer,"lisa, the point of moby dick is ""be yourself."""
28409,Homer,"marge, you awake? marge?"
28410,Homer,"gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
28419,Homer,"hey, you're not mean. it was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. we're not so different. give me a hug."
28422,Homer,"oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!"
28431,Homer,"it's so easy to condemn, so hard to create."
28441,Homer,bart! you're not hitting hard enough!
28443,Homer,"you just lost a box, pal!"
28462,Homer,"yes, you're right..."
28465,Homer,"you hit him high, i'll hit him low!"
28475,Homer,i'm hungry. are they married yet?
28476,Homer,then whose garter is this?
28479,Homer,oh my god! a dvd player.
28481,Homer,"oh yes, i am... your present is right in the other room."
28485,Homer,"may the spirit of retsin be with you all year long. god bless god, amen."
28488,Homer,joe dimaggio?
28499,Homer,"uh, sure, you know it. the biggest tree from the finest lot in town!"
28500,Homer,"it's fine. everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio."
28509,Homer,"c'mon marge, i'm not the only selfish person. you have to get your hair done at ""supercuts."" i guess regular ""cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
28521,Homer,"children, children, what day is this?"
28526,Homer,"no need, flanders. i've already given them my old clothes."
28529,Homer,"look, lenny. i know i was a pretty bad secret santa, so i wanted to make it up to you."
28538,Homer,i built a skating rink for the whole town!
28539,Homer,"here's your skates. oh, you'll have to take off those boots."
28547,Homer,now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on christmas to discover they have no presents.
28551,Homer,"let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. but we're probably right. amen."
28553,Homer,"look, maggie! funny daddy!"
28563,Homer,"honey, this marriage is a partnership. when you fall, i pick you up. and when you can't finish a sandwich, i eat that sandwich."
28564,Homer,and i promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
28570,Homer,"many childless advocates are like ben affleck -- famous, successful people from out of state!"
28581,Homer,a ten-speed bike?! what did your mother say?
28595,Homer,son are you okay? i brought my home-made first aid kit. it's spring-loaded for quick access!
28600,Homer,why... do... i... suck?
28617,Homer,"listen son, there's something i have to tell you about our robot."
28623,Homer,"that's what we in the business call ""a biggie."""
28626,Homer,"bart, i'm sorry -- i could never build a robot this awesome. i'm a fraud."
28628,Homer,you really think so?
28637,Homer,great. and i'll have a diet coke. deep fried.
28643,Homer,i had a car!
28647,Homer,"...you probably want to talk this over, so i'll leave you two ""alone."" excuse me."
28651,Homer,i'll do it!
28652,Homer,guess what? i quit my job as a used car salesman.
28653,Homer,"get with the program, marge. your husband is now an ambulance driver!"
28662,Homer,"hospital, eh? wow, everyone's goin' there tonight."
28665,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah. i need some dinner, stat! and the kids need some cpr lessons."
28666,Homer,i'll say.
28669,Homer,"ooh, ice cream truck!"
28679,Homer,i did.
28689,Homer,the harpooned heart. book on tape! as read by mary-kate and ashley olsen.
28703,Homer,"why would i rub her back unless i wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good."
28715,Homer,these charity address labels that came in the mail.
28718,Homer,five bucks? i don't need your sharity! i'll dance for my money!
28719,Homer,"i am so wasted. oh my god, oh my god, we're having a simultaneous pass out!"
28726,Homer,all the answers you need are in here. happy anniversary!
28727,Homer,nope.
28728,Homer,nope.
28731,Homer,"i heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor."
28738,Homer,"hoo boy, are you in trouble."
28741,Homer,"where's the ""ee-yow?"""
28742,Homer,you didn't sit on the toilet!
28756,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you're getting into that school!"
28767,Homer,that still sounds like the smart kid.
28769,Homer,that's me. huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
28774,Homer,hit the red button!
28778,Homer,"oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
28779,Homer,"well, marge, you can't say i never take you anywhere."
28790,Homer,the re-deadening? is that any good?
28791,Homer,"hey lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?"
28801,Homer,"who loves ya, baby?"
28804,Homer,"that's it. it's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin."
28810,Homer,"c'mon, little fella. you're hangin' with me tonight."
28816,Homer,check it out! i own a multi-national corporation. i always knew some day i'd be a c.o.d.
28819,Homer,don't tell my kids i'm going to jail! tell them i've joined the blue man group! i'm the fat one!
28828,Homer,"oh bart, what a man you've become."
28830,Homer,"man, even i think movie popcorn has gotten too big."
28838,Homer,he's in the house?
28846,Homer,i drank this much!
28851,Homer,"come on, we'll have a blast. kids, while we're out, the tv's in charge. go to bed when it says."
28854,Homer,yep. your mother and i have become a legendary party couple. like scott and zelda munster!
28856,Homer,no problem. we can still have fun without you drinking.
28865,Homer,"okay, okay. remember the rules for drinking and driving. drive slow but not too slow. drink some cola to keep yourself alert."
28868,Homer,"in a minute, honey."
28885,Homer,dammit!
28886,Homer,marge!
28890,Homer,"no wonder they call it ""the good book."""
28891,Homer,"aw, shut up, captain bringdown."
28892,Homer,"okay, marge. for you i'll give up rum-based cocktails. except mojitos and rum and coke."
28895,Homer,"hey, anything's possible. with a little help from my bible."
28898,Homer,woo hoo!
28902,Homer,"it's not all your fault. all these years, i watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet i did nothing. so in a way, i too am a victim... of you."
28903,Homer,"oh, i get it. blame the strangler."
28921,Homer,"i'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. we're all out of triple a's, so i'm gonna whittle down a couple of these d's."
28923,Homer,"come on, it's your last night of freedom. you gotta have some fun."
28924,Homer,"hey, take it easy on skinner. he's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
28931,Homer,"whatever. the important thing is to get skinner to that altar. because once a union has been sanctified by god, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
28933,Homer,"don't worry, i've got a man on the perimeter."
28942,Homer,"hey, if we get your girlfriend back i won't have to."
28943,Homer,"okay, just repeat after me. ""edna, i made a huge mistake and i want you back."""
28948,Homer,uh-oh.
28950,Homer,"string quartet, are you tuned up?"
28955,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get something to eat."
28960,Homer,would you marry me again?
28966,Homer,can i have both?
28968,Homer,exactly.
28976,Homer,"what kind of an airline routes all their flights through nome, alaska?"
28977,Homer,here's your future!
28979,Homer,"marge, let's do it."
28980,Homer,we get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? as the bible says: screw that!
28990,Homer,i've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
28993,Homer,occupied!
28994,Homer,"at last, we're alone..."
29000,Homer,never!
29006,Homer,that sliding should stop soon.
29013,Homer,do i ever!
29016,Homer,nope. just lookin' for that golden ticket.
29017,Homer,"nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! at long last."
29018,Homer,huh?
29021,Homer,usa! usa!
29022,Homer,comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
29025,Homer,hold it right there!
29033,Homer,"maybe you're right, lisa. maybe you're pie. pie-be you're pie."
29037,Homer,this is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
29044,Homer,"watch it, one more step. welcome to my secret lair."
29045,Homer,"so it would seem. anyhoo, i'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? mild-mannered homer simpson..."
29046,Homer,honorable men can differ. now what brings you down here?
29047,Homer,"all right, i'll stop. but what'll i do with these pies?"
29051,Homer,or should i?
29053,Homer,since when do i listen to cakes?
29059,Homer,but i promised my daughter--
29072,Homer,no. i won't. there's only one way i can escape from this nightmare.
29077,Homer,homer drunk... but how? hmmm...
29079,Homer,my beer! you never had a chance to become my urine! why you little...
29085,Homer,i couldn't believe my eye.
29086,Homer,"she was the prettiest girl i'd ever seen. uh... until i met your mother, who made that girl look like a godzilla made of garbage."
29095,Homer,it was pretty delicious.
29096,Homer,it felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.
29099,Homer,we had just finished our first smooch. and i felt a feeling i'd never felt before:
29102,Homer,she wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
29112,Homer,that's not true! i thought about that girl every day of my life... until i met you.
29117,Homer,"oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be marge."
29123,Homer,"oh, sorry, right."
29125,Homer,everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
29131,Homer,"oh, homer, stop it!"
29132,Homer,even my best friends have left me! i'm all alone!
29135,Homer,"son, i've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. don't rock the boat. don't even get in the boat."
29139,Homer,what'd you say?
29148,Homer,to love our country is no chore...
29149,Homer,"we mean it, don't move."
29156,Homer,"oh, what's the use? even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate america. i don't want to end up like elmo, hanging himself in prison."
29157,Homer,and here no one calls me a fat jerk... i'm a gourmand!
29162,Homer,"now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. i'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop."
29173,Homer,he tosses a paper and yells out the window.
29178,Homer,everyone okay?
29188,Homer,"i'm so sorry, honey. i said good things about you too. check out the lifestyle section: ""plastic pearls make the girl."""
29197,Homer,"and while you're there, can you get my frisbee off the ledge?"
29201,Homer,"so, what'd i die of? too much happiness? naked girl avalanche?"
29205,Homer,"hey chief, throw me your piece."
29206,Homer,"c'mon, shoot me a new one!"
29219,Homer,i've got her!
29225,Homer,"marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
29227,Homer,there's a whole rack of 'em over there. i only ate two.
29229,Homer,"we'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. bart?... lisa?..."
29233,Homer,i say when we're full. you don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
29238,Homer,turn that down!
29240,Homer,a slightly colder fridge? in my lifetime? amazing.
29242,Homer,"a walk-in microwave! hey marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
29245,Homer,"i'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie."
29247,Homer,"man, that hurt. and now to do the exact same thing again."
29248,Homer,all right.
29250,Homer,easy... easy...
29254,Homer,"steady, steady..."
29267,Homer,"i'm proud of you, honey."
29270,Homer,"hey sweetie, is mom winning?"
29272,Homer,but win the contest?
29274,Homer,"look! it's mister cashew... the koobler dwarfs... snip, crinkle and poof..."
29277,Homer,blood for creme! blood for creme!
29280,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him. oh, well. bart, i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. but what's going on up here?"
29284,Homer,good. that'll save us some time. okay... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed?
29285,Homer,exactly. and we're poor because we have kids. and the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
29286,Homer,"well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough."
29294,Homer,"oh, i love to see my man eat."
29301,Homer,"oh, what's the big deal? bart didn't like his presents. so what? it's not like he gives us such great gifts. remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? what was that? that was crap."
29308,Homer,"c'mon, say something conclusive."
29313,Homer,woo hoo! the circus!
29315,Homer,what about that two-headed goat?
29322,Homer,"chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything i've ever had at this table."
29325,Homer,"oh come on, marge. the only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
29326,Homer,i'm here! i'm here! quit buggin' me!
29328,Homer,i swallowed a chicken bone.
29333,Homer,"marge, listen to me. chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. you're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together."
29345,Homer,"chief, my daughter's up there. you're a father too."
29346,Homer,pretend to care!
29352,Homer,"i've been reading this magazine for years, but i never dreamed my son would be on the cover."
29353,Homer,you broke in!
29355,Homer,look at all that cash.
29362,Homer,"hey, just 'cause i'm not working doesn't mean i can't gripe like you guys. don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?"
29366,Homer,"i'm pathetic? because i take money from my ten-year-old son? well, let me tell you something: i still call the shots around here!"
29368,Homer,the couch is like that tree!
29374,Homer,"oh, you'll win for sure. you and science go together like lenny and carl. the science is carl."
29377,Homer,stupid atomic pile. how hard could it be to build a reactor? korea did it. and look at the quality of their animation.
29386,Homer,"oh, that's madiculous."
29393,Homer,"sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. if i turn this dial..."
29394,Homer,"the resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those blu-blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear."
29396,Homer,are you prepared to take that chance?
29400,Homer,"well, i'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
29406,Homer,"nice tux, moe."
29408,Homer,act like burns!
29410,Homer,"wow, a wooden plane. it's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks."
29412,Homer,"c'mon, marge. this place is great. free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future."
29431,Homer,no cameras?
29440,Homer,"we really appreciate your help, johnny. is there any way we can repay ya?"
29444,Homer,"well, at least we're all in this together."
29445,Homer,"we'll make it, dad. on a wing and a prayer."
29456,Homer,"oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
29463,Homer,marge! how dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
29465,Homer,"look, look. i can see you're upset. if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
29484,Homer,what do i do?
29485,Homer,you're absolutely right! stop this ride!
29488,Homer,catch your flight?
29489,Homer,what's a cuckold?
29490,Homer,he's only your emotional uncle! i'm your real uncle!
29493,Homer,but i have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
29495,Homer,marge!
29497,Homer,you leave my wife alone!
29505,Homer,you better be strong
29514,Homer,"boon chacalacala / / in your face! / my son flips frogs like a girl, yeah! a-boom! a-ba! a who's your daddy?"
29516,Homer,i'm happy!
29519,Homer,i know why you're here. you wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. well fine.
29521,Homer,you wanna do my dance after you score?
29526,Homer,"ooh, i forgot crotch grabbing. that'll be the sun."
29532,Homer,"all right, all right, i'll work it out."
29535,Homer,"first, i want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
29537,Homer,"this is either about me, or steroids."
29542,Homer,"dammit! well, i'll still do it. you suckers, i would have paid you."
29545,Homer,every single super bowl halftime show has been great.
29552,Homer,"sure, i'd be happy to tell you my problem. i've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with."
29558,Homer,"oh mighty god, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
29560,Homer,i thought america was hungry for meaning. i should have just sent a crocodile into space like i originally planned.
29566,Homer,barf for your master!
29567,Homer,lousy american-made dog!
29582,Homer,this'll be the worst thanksgiving dinner ever.
29586,Homer,i know what i'm doing. you can use any section of the paper. except metro. it's a big snooze.
29592,Homer,you leave maggie to me.
29596,Homer,love the lie!
29603,Homer,"hey, i gotta get in on this! these people have rights! the right to buy me a sixty-two inch tv!"
29606,Homer,"now to answer all the pop-ups. ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. that's only fair."
29610,Homer,"hey, what can i say? i love love."
29623,Homer,i wasn't joking.
29625,Homer,"marge, i'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister patty."
29629,Homer,correction. the first blimp that got her pregnant.
29631,Homer,save my place.
29635,Homer,and please let thy holy spirit open the heart of my wife. amen.
29645,Homer,"eh, they'll be fine."
29648,Homer,is there a chance for advancement?
29650,Homer,"aw, dammit! chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?"
29656,Homer,i won't do it.
29670,Homer,"son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters."
29671,Homer,"and it's something to be feared -- right, doctor?"
29687,Homer,"wow, it makes the lincoln memorial look like crap."
29689,Homer,"don't mention it, miss october. but don't look at her passport, it's different."
29690,Homer,"i've heard of these guys. you can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
29693,Homer,"oh, look at him sleeping. he's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. yes you are... yes you are!"
29705,Homer,"it wasn't easy, marge -- i've missed you so much."
29706,Homer,is there any other kind?
29707,Homer,"wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate."
29717,Homer,"wait, you're not bart! eh, close enough."
29719,Homer,"let's see now... ""kill spiders?"" we don't have spiders."
29723,Homer,baaart!
29724,Homer,"hm, where's the pain? there it is!"
29728,Homer,haven't we all?
29734,Homer,uninsurable?!
29737,Homer,okay. i'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
29741,Homer,it's my money... i'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...
29744,Homer,"hey, i earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, i'm at work busting my hump."
29747,Homer,you banged?
29750,Homer,"kids, your mother and i have decided to take a little break from each other. while we deal with our issues, i plan to go on ""motorhome makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. all i need is for someone to start a show called ""motorhome makeover."""
29755,Homer,woo hoo! free gas!
29758,Homer,are you crazy? let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
29759,Homer,it's a deal! woo hoo!
29770,Homer,"hey, that judge thought i rocked. case closed! although my case is still open."
29771,Homer,"if you need me, i'll be in my trailer!"
29789,Homer,kids! why's the cat so fat?
29804,Homer,"say, is that a gang tattoo? i thought those weren't allowed."
29807,Homer,"well, if you really must know..."
29810,Homer,what are you dopes lookin' at? you've never seen bling-bling before?
29813,Homer,deal!
29817,Homer,marge! how did you get in here?
29820,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i got you into this mess. can i snitch on my heart and say... ""i love you""?"
29838,Homer,"c'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. after decompressing, of course."
29840,Homer,i know! it's a hover car!
29851,Homer,you don't know the half of it.
29853,Homer,"the water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked s-turns..."
29854,Homer,around the loop of death...and out the mail slot! then it's the yard's problem.
29855,Homer,"aw, that's it. i'm going to moe's!"
29856,Homer,it's raining outside.
29860,Homer,so what's stephen hawking doing here?
29872,Homer,"wow, it's been so long since i've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig i am."
29875,Homer,"ray, will you help me fix my roof?"
29877,Homer,to my new buddy. now all we need is an awesome theme song. whatever plays next on the jukebox.
29891,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
29892,Homer,that's ned flanders. there's one in every neighborhood.
29893,Homer,"goodbye, ray! bye! oh, he turned the corner. ooh! now i see him again!"
29907,Homer,now. now. nnnow.
29911,Homer,"ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!"
29913,Homer,what's going on? where are my shoes?
29915,Homer,"fine, i admit it. help me, ray! appear and strike them down!"
29919,Homer,there has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like flanders and bart... wait! the bartender at knockers.
29920,Homer,"wow. my subconscious is a genius. well, that's all very convincing, and..."
29926,Homer,real.
29934,Homer,the awesome power of the human mind.
29942,Homer,at what time?
29943,Homer,"and if i wanna watch it, what day?"
29952,Homer,and what time? would be a good time to see it?
29954,Homer,"so it's mondays at nine, on nbc."
29955,Homer,cbs.
29960,Homer,why did i give her a gun? but i repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. until all the kinks are worked out.
29961,Homer,"aw, my little boy's in love."
29962,Homer,"c'mon, son. you can fight this. do the bartman. do the bartman!"
29963,Homer,why don't you dance? dance?!
29970,Homer,"son, i just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. leave your body. make lots of friends!"
29972,Homer,so that's where my soot went!
29983,Homer,time to take out the euro-trash.
29990,Homer,cheeseburger.
29995,Homer,fine. i'd rather die.
30001,Homer,"marge, i'm giving birth to a food baby."
30005,Homer,lisa sings so sweetly and bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
30006,Homer,"and she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. oh, thank you for this angel, lord!"
30016,Homer,let daddy go talk to the man.
30018,Homer,"is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'cause i can make it greener..."
30024,Homer,"hey, gimme a break. living through lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me."
30025,Homer,you love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
30029,Homer,do you know the hours i worked? the people i had to yell at? the tires i had to slash?
30034,Homer,ha! smart move. soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. after i make my new client a star.
30040,Homer,marge. bart. maggie. santa's little helper. lisa!
30044,Homer,flanders?
30050,Homer,"sure did. i'd do anything for you, honey. especially if it's easy."
30067,Homer,"begat. uh, do you have any books on the rapture?"
30069,Homer,"no, thank you."
30074,Homer,up bup bup!
30082,Homer,"marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
30087,Homer,"all right, everybody. pair up with a rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity."
30090,Homer,"don't worry, dad! there's a bus coming for you! drive, drive!"
30106,Homer,forget school! we have to get to the mesa!
30109,Homer,three... two... one...
30111,Homer,woo hoo! i was right!
30114,Homer,how come it's not open yet?
30115,Homer,hm...
30117,Homer,"oh, sorry, uh -- i'd tip you, but i don't have any cash."
30131,Homer,"now listen, if you could just see your way clear to..."
30132,Homer,it was all just a dream.
30135,Homer,"thank you, lord! it's back the way it was."
30138,Homer,"free movie tickets?! i feel like roger ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!"
30143,Homer,"thanks, ned."
30144,Homer,you wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?
30151,Homer,scantily-clad co-eds?
30154,Homer,what a combination -- hot chicks and stupid flanders.
30155,Homer,"yep, and nobody's tellin' him. not even his good buddy god."
30159,Homer,"son, i need to pee, but i can't stop watching. fetch me a bottle."
30160,Homer,"uh, we're watching the latest photos from mars. ho, great stuff. worth every billion."
30166,Homer,...ead.
30174,Homer,"don't worry, i'll straighten things out with coach clay. we're good buddies. we play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" and he always lets me win!"
30184,Homer,after the party.
30189,Homer,i saw my advantage and i took it. that's what heroes do.
30192,Homer,go nuts.
30207,Homer,you've transformed breakfast into dinner. it's a miracle!
30209,Homer,"all pancakes aside, i really came here to talk about my son."
30224,Homer,"marge, relax. i've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
30237,Homer,because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
30238,Homer,"i've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
30239,Homer,i have money!
30246,Homer,"marge would kill me! please, there's gotta be something else i can do. like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. i can't do it next week."
30255,Homer,are you guys almost done?
30295,Homer,you lost that first game to hustle me!
30303,Homer,"well, that's very reasonable."
30307,Homer,and what a man!
30314,Homer,manatees -- defend!
30336,Homer,"lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as i have, consistency is something, something that, something i love you, bart."
30338,Homer,i can't believe you're making money off this!
30353,Homer,the brakes are shot.
30354,Homer,"learn to drive, boy!"
30356,Homer,why you very little...!
30361,Homer,lisa! lisa!
30364,Homer,"marge, we owe her the truth!"
30365,Homer,"lisa, honey, please wake up. if you do, i'll get you a new pony."
30371,Homer,"oh. you always gotta work blue, don't ya marge?"
30382,Homer,"now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome mr. krusty the clown!"
30384,Homer,"mr. stomach, are you hungry? i'm always hungry. now make with the pizza, fatso. you're the stomach!"
30393,Homer,"i just got fired. better check the ""want ads."""
30394,Homer,"ooh! ""truck drivers needed in iraq."""
30395,Homer,trucks are like big cars.
30397,Homer,will she know what this is regarding?
30413,Homer,where's my bucket?
30416,Homer,why you little...

30427,Homer,"nice and hot-o, mr. robot-o!"
30440,Homer,woo hoo!
30441,Homer,suckers.
30442,Homer,"honey, animals don't feel death. that was proved by the scientists at black angus."
30444,Homer,yes i am! i mean...
30447,Homer,marge! you saved me.
30453,Homer,ooh! ooh! i wanna ride the bumper cars!
30454,Homer,i call the red one!
30457,Homer,i'll give you five dollars for it.
30466,Homer,just liftin' this dumbbell.
30468,Homer,"i'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn."
30477,Homer,"oh marge, i love her so much."
30478,Homer,he looks tough.
30480,Homer,"moe, i'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing i barely liked in the first place."
30481,Homer,"sorry, moe. the place for my arm is around my wife."
30486,Homer,that song is a pop music footnote! i didn't say stop!
30489,Homer,"joy to the world, a father's born / let me receive great gifts!"
30493,Homer,what a great father's day!
30497,Homer,what the hell is this?
30501,Homer,it's not my fault! lousy magnet.
30509,Homer,does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
30511,Homer,"oh, i know! but how can i undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
30520,Homer,the first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
30525,Homer,son-of-a... questions? comments?
30530,Homer,"now honey, you know daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
30531,Homer,but i'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.
30532,Homer,i don't know.
30535,Homer,only three?
30537,Homer,"please, you're embarrassing me."
30540,Homer,hmmm. i will run for mayor!
30579,Homer,psst. psst!
30587,Homer,roadrunners are real!
30598,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp... bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
30612,Homer,why you little...
30614,Homer,a mcdonald's where you can get booze!
30619,Homer,i get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
30621,Homer,nooooo!
30623,Homer,"hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"
30628,Homer,"okay, so far i'm rootin' for ya."
30645,Homer,can i be the phantom of the opera?
30648,Homer,it's so beautiful...
30651,Homer,maybe he's cheating on us with the episcopalians.
30658,Homer,and did you know that little baby jesus grew up to be... jesus?
30661,Homer,i said we're free!
30666,Homer,"i need a present for my wife / or i'll have no sex for life / diamond ring, a vase by ming / some kinda useful kitchen thing"
30667,Homer,i need a store i can break into
30670,Homer,i don't care what that letter said. this man raised me single-handedly. when i think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
30672,Homer,"so this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""m"". moleman? mr. burns? m. night shyamalan? that would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
30677,Homer,"okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. oh, that sounds hard. just do it!"
30686,Homer,no... i said i work for a radio station. nine-eighty on the am dial but number one with our viewers!
30687,Homer,uh... well i... i think you're my pappy!
30693,Homer,"wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
30703,Homer,daddy... daddy...
30715,Homer,listen... i wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.
30719,Homer,"hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. it's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
30724,Homer,"why, there must be some mistake."
30729,Homer,eh.
30734,Homer,"look at me, i use a napkin."
30737,Homer,"yeah, i'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
30738,Homer,"uh, but could you add a bacon nose? plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
30743,Homer,why you little...
30748,Homer,"i've got you now, boy."
30764,Homer,"woo hoo! vegas here i come! oh right, bart."
30773,Homer,ow! my ass!
30778,Homer,"through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, i haven't even thought of it yet."
30779,Homer,how long is this commercial anyway?
30780,Homer,huh?
30783,Homer,blue pants! blue pants!
30786,Homer,"well, it did its job. everyone's wearing blue pants now."
30799,Homer,gotcha.
30810,Homer,"well, i guess i should explain. not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so i was out in the forest, hiding."
30811,Homer,i deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
30812,Homer,i figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. money which we could use to pay for bart's operation.
30815,Homer,it's a lot of little stuff. god has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave saturn?
30816,Homer,"don't worry, marge. me and ""terrible two"" here are gonna win that computer for you."
30830,Homer,"so marge, in tomorrow's game i'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
30836,Homer,"old showbiz animals, eh? do you think any of the gremlins from the ""gremlins"" movie are there?"
30842,Homer,"oh, you haven't seen bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume i let something terrible happen."
30849,Homer,uh-oh.
30858,Homer,how did lenny get to be newsfake magazine's man of the year?
30859,Homer,what?! next you'll be telling me he didn't meet woody woodpecker!
30863,Homer,look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.
30866,Homer,"oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."
30878,Homer,don't lean out of the tra--
30886,Homer,"yeah, well i have full tenure."
30889,Homer,"yes, tv-sa?"
30895,Homer,"yeah, that's how i feel about notre dame football."
30900,Homer,she's nowhere to be seen. time to let homer be homer.
30914,Homer,plus i designed a state-of-the-art stadium. we'll fund it with corporate naming rights. it's the duff beer-krustyburger-buzz cola-costington's department store-kwik-e-mart-stupid flanders park!
30916,Homer,maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
30917,Homer,you mean...
30922,Homer,"ooh, a penny. this is my lucky day."
30930,Homer,"send someone right over! ooh, here he is."
30932,Homer,what about her.
30935,Homer,woo hoo!
30941,Homer,"oh, i hate this sub-continent."
30942,Homer,lisa! it's me! i'm in trouble!
30944,Homer,"uh-huh... do i have to? okay, okay, i'll show the cow i adore it."
30954,Homer,"okay book, i didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. um... ""in business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"
30955,Homer,just outsource it to lisa. outsourcing is the answer to everything.
30956,Homer,outsourcing!
30957,Homer,"well, a little book once told me..."
30958,Homer,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
30962,Homer,i won a free soda! i am a god!
30963,Homer,i am a god! i know all!
30977,Homer,"so, thou art a widow, eh?! then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee."
30981,Homer,she's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
30989,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll see to it you fundamentalist christians live to take over all america by the twenty-first century!"
30990,Homer,"man, that bird did it all. good guy."
30994,Homer,"my wig! i mean, my natural hair!"
30999,Homer,...three... two... one... happy new year! my resolution is to be more fun!
31000,Homer,"uh, gimme a second, i'm in the bathroom."
31006,Homer,"oh my god, our boat is upside down!"
31009,Homer,"hey, check it out, i'm scratcher or something."
31017,Homer,you seem cool. wanna catch a movie?
31023,Homer,how did this happen?
31028,Homer,i'm needed at the door!
31029,Homer,"seventy-four? oh sorry, there's been a mistake."
31043,Homer,jogging?
31050,Homer,"yeah, but he's cool with it. right?"
31052,Homer,now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
31064,Homer,you used to love my non sequiturs!
31066,Homer,"marge, if i can't make you remember me, then i'll make you fall for me all over again."
31069,Homer,just wait. we're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
31073,Homer,"i know. wait, i thought of another way: i stay!"
31082,Homer,at least she's found someone who can make her happy.
31087,Homer,really? well she's still great!
31089,Homer,"uh, yeah. i started when you were in the hospital. i was so worried. recently i tried this thing called ""beer."" and..."
31098,Homer,"oh, he ain't gettin' married. he has commitment issues!"
31099,Homer,"when you get to third base, i'll buy ya a beer."
31109,Homer,"wow, this 3-d is amazing! you can actually feel the vase!"
31110,Homer,"sorry, flanders. but when you get in, you can use my audio tour. narrated by melanie griffith."
31112,Homer,my mind is always open to new ideas.
31114,Homer,this is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
31117,Homer,"thanks, marge. it's not a twist-off!"
31121,Homer,"oh wait, it was a twist-off."
31124,Homer,nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.
31126,Homer,"don't worry, i'll use the money i make to buy tickets from a scalper. then i'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! rich! we did it, baby! we made it through the rain!"
31128,Homer,cop! act like you're in love with me.
31130,Homer,nine volt! double a! d!-d!-d!-d! cordless drill!
31135,Homer,buck mitchell!
31149,Homer,just sign your name above president lincoln's.
31150,Homer,and i say a monkey can mow our lawn!
31153,Homer,like i always say: compromise is the key.
31156,Homer,"oh, you're so hot."
31160,Homer,"so, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
31166,Homer,"yeah, they beat me up at work. look at the word they wrote on my skull."
31188,Homer,just get the money.
31192,Homer,"uh, it fell off a truck. you know, a truck-truck."
31196,Homer,can i still talk with my hands?
31200,Homer,"marge, could you let it go? you won. she's dead!"
31205,Homer,i know -- i'll use that white-noise machine i got you when your father died.
31206,Homer,"transport yourself to the shores of nova scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
31214,Homer,i love you so much. damn you!
31220,Homer,no mas! no mas!
31224,Homer,deal!
31227,Homer,then stand back!
31229,Homer,we already own a book!
31231,Homer,"this doesn't look easy, but i'll bet it is."
31236,Homer,what's the point? we're all slowly dying.
31237,Homer,"you sure are, sweetie -- i love this bed you made."
31248,Homer,mmm... extra-virgin...
31251,Homer,"marge, giving me credit was your idea. now could you rub my butt? i sat on it so much it's a little sore."
31252,Homer,"look, i'm sorry you're upset. but if we tell the truth now, i'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. then you won't be married to a man. you'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the florida keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. you don't want that."
31262,Homer,hmm... let me mull that over.
31263,Homer,what are struts?
31265,Homer,and i promised these guys money i don't have! and they're gonna be so mad!
31271,Homer,and now to get stinking drunk!
31275,Homer,uh-oh. oh. why must we preserve america's historic roller coasters?
31276,Homer,thank you honey!
31279,Homer,"marge, i realized something when i was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. i'm just glad i have you as my safety bar."
31285,Homer,"marge, i ate it, it's over."
31286,Homer,oh no you don't!
31293,Homer,"ooh, teenagers... no! today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them."
31295,Homer,no.
31296,Homer,beer-battered germans...
31298,Homer,i used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
31299,Homer,dr. phil mcgraw!
31304,Homer,"what happened to ""for better or for worse?!"""
31309,Homer,what's goin' on?
31317,Homer,"go ahead and hide, you coward!"
31318,Homer,burn everything!
31319,Homer,that's alien talk!
31320,Homer,i'm proud of what i achieved during my rioting.
31332,Homer,"aw, no, daddy's just teasing. of course you could. you could keep it under a hundred. yes, you could."
31340,Homer,everyone got an assignment but us.
31341,Homer,i wonder what makes us so special.
31345,Homer,"okay, these are war games and i'm head of my team. i have to think like a great military leader."
31347,Homer,"stay crunchy, men! stay crunchy!"
31349,Homer,gung hay fat choi! gung hay fat choi!
31351,Homer,"bring it on, chumps!"
31357,Homer,rise my pretties! find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
31359,Homer,"yeah, marge always loves your cards. well, you may not be the smartest guys in the army..."
31362,Homer,predator drone!
31365,Homer,"thinking it over, huh? i'm cool with that."
31370,Homer,don't forge? don't forge what?
31375,Homer,"oh, i was supposed to take moe fishing today! everybody hide!"
31377,Homer,"whoa, marge, who'd you piss off?"
31390,Homer,wow. troopers from every state in new england.
31401,Homer,"hmmm... maple syrup. sleigh on the label, very good."
31404,Homer,i'm the king of goofing off!
31409,Homer,ice cream man! wait!
31420,Homer,he was following my design.
31426,Homer,you give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. god bless america!
31437,Homer,"hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down."
31439,Homer,"well, i'm off to pedal my frosty wares!"
31448,Homer,"oh my god, i've only got nine seconds till marge's show!"
31464,Homer,marge?
31467,Homer,the world's not that interested!
31468,Homer,wow! you made me a sculpture of magilla gorilla.
31472,Homer,recording that fake fight was a great idea.
31480,Homer,woo hoo! marital sex!
31485,Homer,chapter one: the rubystone in the door-portal. are you asleep yet?
31493,Homer,an unexpected occurrence?! what could it be?!
31497,Homer,"oh, greystash. greystash! oh, hello, lisa."
31509,Homer,"give back that holiday cheer, you bastard!"
31512,Homer,"marge, we have a problem here."
31513,Homer,do you think that's the same grumple from the ice show? because i do.
31531,Homer,"for your information, since i bought it i put on a ton of weight."
31537,Homer,"a hundred and seventeen degrees! ooo, that reminds me."
31539,Homer,"now remember, marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. but if i scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five."
31552,Homer,"nice brush work, emily. nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her."
31575,Homer,yeahhhh!
31576,Homer,shiiiii... pwreck!
31577,Homer,"uh... sure we will, son. right, captain?"
31582,Homer,why you little...
31585,Homer,oh my god! it's beautiful!
31595,Homer,how's it goin'?
31606,Homer,revenge! okay.
31607,Homer,"oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane."
31615,Homer,...iiiiiis!
31625,Homer,oh. hold on.
31638,Homer,you? you're too dumb to tell a story.
31645,Homer,"that's okay, boy. the two of us got to talking."
31664,Homer,that was me. some very un-cool people put me in here.
31669,Homer,simpson men get the job done!
31671,Homer,"i mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific american, where..."
31672,Homer,actually... that was me.
31677,Homer,"son, one day you're going to be a great father."
31680,Homer,"stop it, winston!"
31683,Homer,hm... what's changed for me since the last time i saw you? only... everything!
31692,Homer,that's the pool chemicals talking.
31705,Homer,"relax, baby. while you were dreaming of me and calling me ""james,"" i took care of everything."
31706,Homer,"eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. now don't worry: i packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world."
31711,Homer,permission to moan?
31722,Homer,"come on, dad, i'm cuttin' back everywhere. to save gas i'm ""flintstone-ing"" the car."
31731,Homer,"dad, do you know what you were kissing? do you? do you?"
31732,Homer,"well i never, ever want to see that again."
31737,Homer,"words hurt, you know."
31738,Homer,stupid selma and grampa... how dare they find happiness?
31741,Homer,i've got a good feeling about this.
31743,Homer,"hola, i am esteban de la sexface. that means stephen of the sexface."
31752,Homer,so... how long is señor homer out of town for?
31754,Homer,where is he? where is he? i smell his aftershave!
31757,Homer,"oh, i get it. these are those trick candles you can't blow out."
31763,Homer,"yeah, but uh-- one of those i dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but i was too embarrassed to admit it, so i set the house on fire. it feels good to tell the truth. no, i'm lying again, it feels bad."
31767,Homer,"tick tock, sweetie."
31768,Homer,i'm going with the cologne i wore on our first date.
31790,Homer,i wanted to remember my place in the book i was reading.
31807,Homer,how could you publish this? i thought we were friends!
31809,Homer,you're right -- i'm giving up photography...
31819,Homer,providing you celebrities do something for me.
31824,Homer,never!
31825,Homer,why don't i just put on a dress?!
31829,Homer,"wait, that's soccer? i always called it ""human foosball."" would you like me to take you to your game?"
31833,Homer,i got fired from foot locker.
31836,Homer,i'm open! i'm open!
31843,Homer,foul on twenty-three!
31844,Homer,i said foul on twenty-three!
31847,Homer,she has not! your daughter's a dirty player!
31848,Homer,i don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!
31850,Homer,yellow card!
31852,Homer,un-sportsman-like conduct.
31856,Homer,you said it -- enjoy me while i last.
31870,Homer,my son caught the ball! this makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
31881,Homer,knock it off! he's just a kid!
31884,Homer,"oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
31885,Homer,"let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels, and you can play swim-up blackjack with abraham lincoln! it's the land of sleep. and your passport: a simple mattress."
31886,Homer,a common problem. try this.
31892,Homer,"oh, i think i know what you're doing wrong. have you tried..."
31895,Homer,on one condition: you do the shlepping.
31896,Homer,move over just a...
31903,Homer,sorry.
31912,Homer,"good work, boy. just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
31930,Homer,zombie kill.
31933,Homer,zombie montage:
31936,Homer,"what are you, a travel agent? 'cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
31942,Homer,any moment...
31945,Homer,what the hell is that?
31947,Homer,"marge, when you see me next i'll be a soggy, smoky hero. mmm, soggy, smoky hero."
31948,Homer,don't tell me how to do my job!
31949,Homer,we don't get what?
31952,Homer,i hope it's spaghetti!
31953,Homer,"lousy burns so ungrateful, i hate him so much..."
31955,Homer,and some stuff i wanted.
31985,Homer,i'm lost and i'm starving!
31986,Homer,i don't have any holders!
31992,Homer,"cheer up, boy. we'll get you their most vicious street cur! he'll bite your ass raw!"
31995,Homer,"well, i can breathe out okay."
31997,Homer,i'm okay.
31999,Homer,woo-hoo! business trip!
32000,Homer,"apu, i'm returning a yogurt i wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
32017,Homer,here! it's yours!
32024,Homer,what'd you say?
32030,Homer,nothing's gonna ruin this one. the timer's a tickin.
32036,Homer,"hey suckers, check it out. marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery."
32044,Homer,i have a right to my views.
32051,Homer,"fine, cone."
32061,Homer,kent brockman!
32062,Homer,"i'm sorry marge, but i won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."
32067,Homer,what a great show: real people with real problems!
32069,Homer,woo hoo!
32073,Homer,hoo!
32086,Homer,drive to chicago? i don't have time for that. i have to be back at work on monday. and my boss is a total jerk.
32087,Homer,a p-p-p-p-p-private jet!
32088,Homer,"yeah, but i'm on a plane, idiot."
32091,Homer,"oh my god... lionel richie?! can you sing ""say you say me,"" but make it about beer?"
32095,Homer,"no! if i leave the plane, i'll be just like everyone else!"
32096,Homer,i wanna be back on the plane.
32102,Homer,no way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! i flew on a private plane.
32111,Homer,"okay. uh... well uh... hm, i just uh. i forget what i do."
32115,Homer,"fine, i'll show you a winner, just you watch."
32116,Homer,think positive. think positive.
32117,Homer,you were saying...
32126,Homer,how many of those have private planes?
32135,Homer,look happy.
32151,Homer,"yeah, uh... semper fudge!"
32152,Homer,"no, i said the right thing."
32154,Homer,marge... i've gotta be honest...
32155,Homer,i don't know. maybe we flew through a rainbow.
32158,Homer,i'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
32169,Homer,"you'll never catch me, lord!"
32178,Homer,"dude! you don't think you know me, but you do!"
32186,Homer,stop that! i'm down here!
32195,Homer,"oh, no! not in spring-time! / summer, winter or fall! no, never could i leave you at all!"
32211,Homer,"hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor..."
32212,Homer,"keep reachin' for the stars, kid."
32216,Homer,to the hottest girls in the room.
32217,Homer,i said you look hot! hot! ay chihuahua!
32220,Homer,"and may i say i'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
32229,Homer,"um, everyone's wearing clothes in here."
32250,Homer,all over the floor.
32251,Homer,"hey apu, what happened to all your milk?"
32254,Homer,it's paint. or is it?
32257,Homer,at first i thought you were pointing to your crotch.
32259,Homer,"aw, please, give me a break. i've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids."
32260,Homer,okay. let me just grab my registration.
32271,Homer,i would love to! but i don't have a tow truck.
32279,Homer,really? what's your handicap?
32287,Homer,"guess what, boy. last night i towed your principal's car."
32293,Homer,what? i'm still in springfield.
32297,Homer,"ooh, a trap door. what's down there? your meatball collection?"
32302,Homer,do not worry. i am working.
32309,Homer,maggie!
32311,Homer,maggie! you did all this?!
32322,Homer,american sober or irish sober?
32325,Homer,"goodnight, sweetheart."
32328,Homer,"ooo, an awesome accident! easy, easy... i'll just take three seconds to gawk. aw, everyone's okay."
32340,Homer,you don't owe him anything. moe was in the hospital for three weeks and i didn't visit him once.
32349,Homer,"out of my way, mystery skank!"
32357,Homer,i'll kill her after dessert!
32361,Homer,"okay, here's the deal, i'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids."
32375,Homer,"don't worry, son -- i've got a plan to save your space doggy."
32378,Homer,"can i help you, gentlemen?"
32379,Homer,"wow, you guys are good. the alien's right here in the living room."
32381,Homer,homer -- bored!
32382,Homer,quiet -- we're missing the dissection!
32385,Homer,"oh, lighten up. it's halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment."
32386,Homer,hold still! i'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
32389,Homer,"okay maggie, just calmly and carefully back away."
32391,Homer,blueberries!
32393,Homer,there are so many choices. bolo? clip on? piano keys? ten commandments of beer?
32395,Homer,and what color would that be?
32397,Homer,uh...
32398,Homer,"is ""beautiful"" a color?"
32410,Homer,where is it?
32422,Homer,"/ when happy they sparkle, when sad they cries"
32423,Homer,"/ those eyes are gems beyond appraisal / stunning shade of purest... oh, what is it?! i was so close! let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! oh, it's hopeless! she'll never love me again."
32424,Homer,"hazel! your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw i ate after we first made love."
32432,Homer,"fine, i admit it. i'm drunk!"
32437,Homer,marge won't dump me. i'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
32440,Homer,a makeover!
32445,Homer,are you happy and full of life?
32453,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. i know just what it'll take to hang onto marge."
32454,Homer,"please, doc. i know i'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but i took care of my family, and that used to be enough. but not anymore."
32458,Homer,"no, i had my stomach stapled!"
32461,Homer,a smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
32469,Homer,"no, i want you to give me every other surgery you have so i can look good! and can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
32471,Homer,my implants feel itchy.
32481,Homer,no thanks -- just here for a battery.
32487,Homer,"one battery, please."
32488,Homer,sold! sucker.
32496,Homer,that's how they getcha!
32500,Homer,"finally, some service. now listen. we wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- michigan or better."
32501,Homer,"next time a commercial comes on, i'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as i can."
32502,Homer,i'd like to know if wes doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
32503,Homer,"mr. doobner, i have a complaint: i work hard, and when i go out with my family, i expect a certain level of basic--"
32529,Homer,"hey, kids! have you seen your mother?"
32540,Homer,"oh my god, why would i wanna wipe out my memory? what horrible thing did i do?"
32541,Homer,chief wiggum! i remember seeing you...
32544,Homer,the queen's private surgeonnn!
32545,Homer,what did i do?
32548,Homer,your memory bubble and you.
32554,Homer,the rememberererer?
32576,Homer,all right. let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
32577,Homer,how can i get my memory to work?
32585,Homer,my life's flashing before my eyes.
32586,Homer,a life well-lived. until last night. i guess i'll have to watch that now.
32598,Homer,"hmmm... the only problem is, i'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman. no doubt i'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. and that will make me want to jump off a--"
32599,Homer,"for the love of god, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
32603,Homer,who's an angry dog? who's an angry dog?
32604,Homer,"no, this is a moment i want to remember."
32607,Homer,"now, back away from burns and i will let your dog live."
32619,Homer,"i think i'll miss you most of all, captain corndog's schnitzel palace. no tears, homer."
32620,Homer,"uh-oh, can't let marge see this."
32624,Homer,"hmm... ""dispose of proper--"" this book is too hard."
32635,Homer,"oh my god, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!"
32638,Homer,"you too, fred thompson."
32643,Homer,what i did made the tv thing happen.
32652,Homer,your mother and i were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.
32653,Homer,"we didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."
32655,Homer,a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.
32661,Homer,a tale of two young outlaws in love...
32670,Homer,that was the best christmas ever.
32672,Homer,marge! look over there!
32677,Homer,even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. why can't this be the tunnel of hockey fights?
32683,Homer,look at you! idiots!
32684,Homer,driver of a loaner car / much better than a / driver of my normal car...
32703,Homer,"well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. and then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her."
32710,Homer,but i have all those old diets i still haven't finished.
32717,Homer,"hey marge, looking for something? i'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper i don't like. maybe it'll be this one."
32719,Homer,work.
32721,Homer,i now declare you chips and salsa.
32723,Homer,well... i certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
32732,Homer,"c'mon, boy. all the nerds are doin' it."
32734,Homer,"well, that's our book for the year -- i think we've earned some tv."
32736,Homer,"hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
32738,Homer,that's right. now i'll cut and you soak.
32739,Homer,go-go or boring?
32745,Homer,some of that is cow blood.
32747,Homer,where's our jerky?
32748,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait! you haven't seen our power point presentation. bart?"
32766,Homer,and a very wise fish he is!
49152,Lisa,i'm gonna keep this forever!
49157,Lisa,melvin van horne... sideshow mel?! it's you! how could this happen to you... to all these wonderful performers?
49158,Lisa,"i need to get out while i still can. thank you, mel."
49162,Lisa,i'm trying to set you up for laughs.
49164,Lisa,stop it! both of you! you have a common land! a literature! and the sweetest songs on earth! toora loora loora -- toora loora lie / hush my little baby / hush now don't you cry
49170,Lisa,"dad, is this from a meth lab?"
49179,Lisa,"it's me, you idiot."
49183,Lisa,"i think we're following you. what's your species, little guy?"
49192,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
49199,Lisa,there's bart!
49200,Lisa,"mom, you said all hitchhikers were drug-crazed thrill seekers."
49206,Lisa,"excuse me, boys! my brother is lost, and kind of a jerk. if he'd brought a map of the grounds as i suggested, then we would--"
49213,Lisa,ow.
49214,Lisa,"what are we, a piano bar?"
49216,Lisa,um... i think it's... we don't have one.
49218,Lisa,maybe you could use some help.
49221,Lisa,one more word!
49228,Lisa,"losin' it! ""risqué '80s teen flick!"""
49230,Lisa,"guess what, mom? i'm a cruciverbalist!"
49231,Lisa,"probably, but a cruciverbalist is a fan of crossword puzzles -- which i am!"
49235,Lisa,i... i made them into a crossword.
49237,Lisa,citywide crossword tournament!
49238,Lisa,"ooh, thank you!"
49249,Lisa,i blew it again.
49252,Lisa,dad? did you come into some money we don't know about?
49257,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
49264,Lisa,a couple hours? i can do the sunday puzzle in less than one hour!
49268,Lisa,"""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" wow, it's almost as if dad planted that message. no, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?"
49277,Lisa,"mom, dad! our mall got a mapple store!"
49278,Lisa,it's so sterile! mypods... myphones... a brainiac bar!
49279,Lisa,"i can't afford any of your products, but can i buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think i have a mypod?"
49280,Lisa,"oh, i'll never get a mapple anything."
49292,Lisa,can't you open your mapple menu and click on the compassion bar? oh please?
49293,Lisa,would i ever!
49295,Lisa,save yourselves!
49296,Lisa,huh? where are the bees?
49298,Lisa,"willie, i didn't know you were an apiarist."
49305,Lisa,"it's not for long. but until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees."
49312,Lisa,you'll always have bart. always.
49318,Lisa,you don't?
49320,Lisa,"i know it's not your fault, muk mu. you're a gentle, loving soul."
49338,Lisa,"well... if i pick plain she'll think i'm cheap, but if i pick peanut, she may have an allergy. you just killed her, bart!"
49339,Lisa,"what is this, brooklyn in the fifties? don't just say stuff."
49343,Lisa,does it get you into special exhibits?
49345,Lisa,"hey mom, can juliet sleep over?"
49356,Lisa,i love your accent. two-nicorn. you are definitely doing the book on tape.
49357,Lisa,and queens valedictoria and helvetica hid their beloved two-nicorn from the hungry ogre homeroni.
49362,Lisa,a two-nicorn!
49365,Lisa,it's better if you don't.
49369,Lisa,"i'd love to! oh, but i'm supposed to attend the model u.n. this weekend. i'm the delegate from azerbaijan, and i'm threatening a rice tariff!"
49382,Lisa,"looks like. juliet, i don't want to go to equalia anymore."
49384,Lisa,"goodbye, juliet."
49390,Lisa,he's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
49395,Lisa,vance connor...
49397,Lisa,please stop doing that.
49398,Lisa,both. homer simpson... vance connor... fonzie... homer simpson... and the winner is homer simpson!
49408,Lisa,why does he think alfred's friends with batman?
49410,Lisa,how 'bout italian?
49417,Lisa,"no, but wait. i aced the math part, right? because..."
49433,Lisa,"hm, i wonder if it's theses."
49437,Lisa,this is the lowest we've sunk.
49443,Lisa,"wait, i have an idea! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
49445,Lisa,hello. i'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. may i join your order?
49451,Lisa,why would mother superior lie to me about not having maggie? what is going on?
49459,Lisa,i fell in love with you / heart and soul...
49462,Lisa,big ring... big ring...
49465,Lisa,the biggest ring in springfield...comes from the bell in the springfield bell tower!
49467,Lisa,"oh. well, i seek it so i can find my sister. how do you know about the gem?"
49468,Lisa,tell me all you know about the gem.
49473,Lisa,mr. burns! what are you doing here?
49479,Lisa,"so, the anagram spells: ""regally, the rock gem is..."""
49484,Lisa,"oh, fine, fine, finish your song. i can be patient -- after all, i am the gem child."
49486,Lisa,"no, no, no -- the solution was ""regally the rock gem is lisa""."
49487,Lisa,um... this one?
49490,Lisa,mom! how did you know maggie was here?
49500,Lisa,this broadcast is from 1979.
49502,Lisa,fifty-fifty?
49508,Lisa,i think it's romantic. you can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together.
49518,Lisa,"dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into maggie?"
49528,Lisa,what's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
49530,Lisa,"well, off to school where they'll prepare our little minds for a future we'll never see."
49532,Lisa,"hello, smiley face. hello, smiley face."
49544,Lisa,"um, do you mind if i join you?"
49546,Lisa,is this seat taken?
49554,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. these girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. i hope you understand."
49557,Lisa,"look at this: springfield elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."
49559,Lisa,"i just wish i could go to a school like that -- even for one week. ""tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all."""
49562,Lisa,field trips to europe!
49570,Lisa,"bart, at this school, i'm not a brain, i'm not popular, i'm not anything!"
49571,Lisa,"hi, caitlin."
49575,Lisa,did you just wink at me?
49588,Lisa,"people, i'm not who you think i am. i'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends. yes, i lied to you, but you only liked me because of a lie. so if you think about it--"
49591,Lisa,"mom, i'm glad you brought me here, but isn't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful?"
49594,Lisa,"excuse me, but snow white is a fairytale from hundreds of years ago. no one owns that."
49601,Lisa,so snow white slept and waited for her prince to come... but he never did.
49617,Lisa,two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
49619,Lisa,you're on.
49632,Lisa,you should've seen the look on krabappel's face!
49638,Lisa,that's it? just t.p. her?
49640,Lisa,bart?!
49642,Lisa,"what if i gave you homework help? i won't give you the answers, but i'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
49645,Lisa,"it's pronounced ""d.n.a.,"" you idiot. and we are not the same -- i am not a murderer, and i never will be!"
49651,Lisa,"apu, how did you survive?"
49655,Lisa,and all we had to do was let bart take a bath in our food.
49664,Lisa,my name's lisa and i was playing hide and seek when i met you ladies. please don't hurt me.
49666,Lisa,you mean... witches?
49672,Lisa,spell? those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they?
49674,Lisa,"listen, not that i've lost my skepticism, but i am interested in learning more about wiccans. are you a minority group as defined by ivy league admissions?"
49676,Lisa,i worship nature!
49681,Lisa,"i'm gonna put a spell on you! yes i am, my tuna-breath familiar."
49683,Lisa,with perfect faith and perfect love.
49684,Lisa,they're not evil! they believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like i belonged.
49686,Lisa,they didn't blind anyone -- i have proof!
49687,Lisa,when my father was attending the moonshine competition last saturday...
49688,Lisa,"you heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. to ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. the moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it."
49691,Lisa,change it! change it!
49692,Lisa,you just increased the volume!
49694,Lisa,"really? really? uh-huh, all right."
49696,Lisa,what do you want?
49701,Lisa,because you envy us. maggie and i share the deepest bond there is: sisterhood.
49717,Lisa,i wish i weren't.
49722,Lisa,"if you're not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me."
49723,Lisa,i do! it enrages me!
49735,Lisa,"bart, i'm losing my grip!"
49746,Lisa,i am her / she is me / i'm just like / penelope...
49748,Lisa,"whether she's competing in equestrian events at the 1976 olympics or spending her summers at holyrood palace, princess anne is truly a world leader."
49752,Lisa,wow! how long has the tv been out?
49756,Lisa,this isn't normal tv. it's a videogame that encourages activity and exercise!
49767,Lisa,come on. they're just pins.
49770,Lisa,all dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
41586,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, you want to buy some band candy?"
41592,Lisa,is that robot break-dancing?
49784,Lisa,"what is this, tough love?"
49787,Lisa,i can't wait to see what noble branches lie in the simpson family foliage!
41596,Lisa,armpit noises are not a language.
41599,Lisa,what? i don't want to go to the same college as you.
41604,Lisa,"oh, that's so noble. but what about jenda?"
49797,Lisa,old ad for buzz cola...
49798,Lisa,so dusty.
49800,Lisa,"this entry's dated april 14th, 1860."
49802,Lisa,"""...because tomorrow, i shall get my very first slave."""
49803,Lisa,i can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
41613,Lisa,i sure am hungry for my favorite food...
49805,Lisa,that's all there is -- the rest of the diary has turned to dust!
41615,Lisa,i'll get those no good indians. just as sure as my favorite book is...
41621,Lisa,we were just playing.
49816,Lisa,i'll never know if eliza got virgil safely to freedom!
41625,Lisa,might as well. you're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.
41626,Lisa,"dad, you just destroyed your first kiss."
41627,Lisa,"declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--"
41629,Lisa,but i am just a simple librarian. i have only read about dancing in books.
49824,Lisa,our family has heroes!
41633,Lisa,hey...
41638,Lisa,"uh-oh. should i laugh? was that dry british wit? or subtle self-pity? ooh, they're staring at me, better respond."
49832,Lisa,but i need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to colonel burns!
41641,Lisa,"he's not like anybody i've ever met. he's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. he sure is ugly, though. so why can't i stop staring at him?"
41642,Lisa,"oh, no... i think i'm getting a crush on nelson muntz!"
49833,Lisa,huh?
49836,Lisa,what are you talking about? is there something you know about virgil that you haven't told us?
49839,Lisa,"grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?"
41648,Lisa,"oh my gosh, i've entered the body of our cat!"
49843,Lisa,just close your eyes and think of milhouse.
49846,Lisa,you would mess up mom and dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
41656,Lisa,"geez, why is lisa so mad at me? i only came to this dump so i could be with her. and, what happened to my big sandwich?"
41663,Lisa,a fight? that would mean rejecting the last part of me that's still a girl.
49856,Lisa,anytime.
49863,Lisa,"uh-oh, looks like i'm in more trouble. born to be bad."
41672,Lisa,here it comes.
41676,Lisa,is it possible i've met a teacher who doesn't like me?!
41677,Lisa,"aw, he's sweet. what am i doing? he's just ralph with a dream. the dream of not ralphing. but i'm sure i could totally change and fix him."
49869,Lisa,and now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
49872,Lisa,the man hates pants.
49874,Lisa,"yes, it is fitting."
49875,Lisa,jews don't believe in hell.
49882,Lisa,fine.
41700,Lisa,"thank you, mr. bergstrom."
41703,Lisa,mr. bergstrom left today.
41705,Lisa,i didn't think you'd understand.
49899,Lisa,/ what's going on?
41716,Lisa,that music always sends a chill down my spine.
41725,Lisa,yes. ten please.
41736,Lisa,i stand corrected.
41739,Lisa,"she means you should get a job, stupid."
41741,Lisa,maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. lets see...
41748,Lisa,"you know his blood type, how romantic."
41749,Lisa,"oh, yeah? what's my shoe size?"
49940,Lisa,"dad, no!"
41751,Lisa,"yes, dad."
41752,Lisa,"ooh, look, maggie, what is that? do-dec-ah-edron. dodecahedron."
41761,Lisa,"bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
41762,Lisa,"bart, i do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. i've made things for you. but you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
49957,Lisa,how many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
41770,Lisa,"dear bart, i am using the stationery mom and dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. perhaps if a professional so advises, i will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
41773,Lisa,"oh! this is the best present i ever got. thank you, bart. thank you michael."
41775,Lisa,i don't think real checks have exclamation points.
49967,Lisa,it's better to just fit in with the crowd.
41778,Lisa,"wait, dad!"
49972,Lisa,and not all old people are bad drivers!
49973,Lisa,dad! that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
41783,Lisa,"yes, mom."
49976,Lisa,grandma?!
41785,Lisa,"wow, a bald eagle."
41787,Lisa,"thanks for driving me to the contest, dad."
49980,Lisa,"mom, it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture. he drives a hybrid!"
49982,Lisa,i know where bob's taking bart!
49989,Lisa,"as an eight-year-old girl in twenty-first century america, i know how it is to feel insecure about your looks. but you've got so much going for you. i'd kill for your sense of smell... you have a nice firm handshake..."
41798,Lisa,barbara bush.
49994,Lisa,quiet! it's time for the noblest nobel prize of all: the peace prize.
41806,Lisa,how could i read my essay now? i don't believe my own words.
50002,Lisa,victory for the middle child!
50003,Lisa,hello? hello?
50004,Lisa,huh?
41813,Lisa,the truth must be told.
50005,Lisa,arts arts arts education...
50008,Lisa,"sing what you just said, then play a little guitar riff."
50012,Lisa,it can't be saturday already! monday was orientation. tuesday we did mime.
50013,Lisa,"wednesday we did ""mame."""
41822,Lisa,"it's the german term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
50018,Lisa,"that's right! strike the set, pizza party..."
50021,Lisa,"no! i fell in love with theater, dance, and song!"
41832,Lisa,not any more. you punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. this is my brother... and he knows karate.
50025,Lisa,but arts camp encouraged us to spread our wings and fly.
41835,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
41838,Lisa,i think this is something bart would really have enjoyed. but it's the only way he'll learn.
50031,Lisa,"oh maggie, don't ever turn two."
41847,Lisa,how zen.
41848,Lisa,looking at you with quiet awe.
50040,Lisa,"thanks, guys!"
50044,Lisa,so i want to honor grampa by giving my inheritance to charity. but which one?
50045,Lisa,"ooh, what's this?"
41856,Lisa,"dad, there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall, dinah shore, william shatner, and mel brooks."
50049,Lisa,"i will. i'll take a chance on you, nelson muntz."
50053,Lisa,"ooh, a message from my small business person!"
50055,Lisa,"no, but there is something i can't hold back any more. i'm your microfinance donor!"
50056,Lisa,"well, i didn't do this for thanks, but if you want to thank me, i can stand here and listen for as long as it takes."
50064,Lisa,"that's great, mr. zuckerberg, but i was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
41873,Lisa,not quite. i got some dynamite stuff from rabbi simon ben eleazar.
50065,Lisa,you did?
50068,Lisa,"there, you see?"
50070,Lisa,"nelson, i just wanted to say that i realize now you can't be anyone else other than who you are, and..."
41881,Lisa,"no, bart. peace on earth."
50076,Lisa,sorry!
41888,Lisa,i wish for world peace.
50080,Lisa,"um, i'm treasurer of the jazz club, and started the school's recycling society."
41894,Lisa,mom! dad!
50086,Lisa,it's me!
50092,Lisa,thanks. you can be the free safety.
50099,Lisa,does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?
50100,Lisa,"wow, i'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
41912,Lisa,"dad, i think princess belongs in a stable."
50106,Lisa,hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
50107,Lisa,"well, there's a ninety-seven percent chance i'm not, so do what i say."
50112,Lisa,that dinger was a fluke! not that i have to defend myself to you. managers manage and players play.
41923,Lisa,"she likes a little carrot after her oats. and she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. and if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. please take good care of my princess."
41924,Lisa,i'll never forget you.
50118,Lisa,i need you! ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced.
41927,Lisa,hmmm hmmm. there's a big dumb animal i love even more than that horse.
41934,Lisa,"dad, can you take me to dr. hibbert's office?"
41935,Lisa,"oh, nothing. i just scheduled a tetanus booster. maybe i'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
50133,Lisa,it's something you've never seen: they're smitten.
41942,Lisa,"when bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? there's a moetinee."
50134,Lisa,"well, he is cute. but i'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
41945,Lisa,"no. because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
41947,Lisa,"my jump rope broke, but i just tied it back together."
50141,Lisa,"bite me now, edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
41951,Lisa,did you hear that maggie? another baby in the house.
50149,Lisa,"mom, these grades are amazing! just as good as mine!"
50151,Lisa,well... of course that would be great. but i see myself making an impact... outside the home.
50153,Lisa,"mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the a-train... then suddenly, when she was a high school senior blam!"
41968,Lisa,"bart simpson! the thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. when they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
41969,Lisa,the police will catch you sooner or later.
41970,Lisa,"maybe not, but i bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""property of bart simpson"" label on that radio."
41971,Lisa,"hey, stop that!"
41972,Lisa,what's going on?
50169,Lisa,"what's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home, if i have to do my learning here?"
50170,Lisa,willie!
50172,Lisa,should i get the nurse?
41981,Lisa,"all right, dolphins!"
41987,Lisa,so gambling makes a good thing even better.
50181,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i don't really play."
41993,Lisa,can i watch football with you again next sunday?
41994,Lisa,"point well taken. uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
50186,Lisa,"that school is so great! teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. is mom gonna come up and say goodnight?"
41996,Lisa,"look at the fear in his eyes. listen to the quiver in his voice. he's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
50188,Lisa,mom?
41998,Lisa,"dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous."
50191,Lisa,"because, it's too elitist. everyone's parents are in ""the business."""
50192,Lisa,"i don't know! they won't tell me! and besides... you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy! mom, i'd be honored if i turned out like you."
50196,Lisa,"people of springfield, to quote shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
42006,Lisa,the broken neck blues.
50198,Lisa,"we're called ""little people"" and i'm not one."
50201,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns is here for you again."
42013,Lisa,so that's it. you just wanted me to help you gamble. you never wanted to be with me at all.
50205,Lisa,"i thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
50208,Lisa,"hey, there's a number on him. what is it?"
50212,Lisa,huh. it's a pigeon.
42027,Lisa,"however, i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose. in which case, i'd bet the farm on buffalo."
42030,Lisa,"bart, who's winning?"
50223,Lisa,"i'm a member of people for the ethical treatment of amoebas, the league of women vultures, the n-double-a-c-porcupines, kids for squids, the a.c.l. unicorns, clamnesty international and, uh... well, those are the best ones."
50233,Lisa,so you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
42043,Lisa,"you think you know fear? well, i've seen them naked."
50239,Lisa,don't dare bring that thing in here!
42048,Lisa,she's beautiful!
50242,Lisa,"so i never want to see another christmas tree... until mom comes back, safe and sound."
42052,Lisa,yeah?
42054,Lisa,is it that exchange student mx!pa?
50248,Lisa,"but until then this tree will stand for everything mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
50253,Lisa,"ms. stewart, i made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles!"
50258,Lisa,...everywhere you go
50259,Lisa,did you get a good house-sitter?
42068,Lisa,"mom, they're professional athletes. they're used to this sort of thing. it rolls right off their backs."
42069,Lisa,"no mom, it counts as a hit. dad just won the game."
50262,Lisa,dad's underwear!
42071,Lisa,"janey, school is never a waste of time."
42075,Lisa,can you tell me if i have what it takes to be a blues musician?
50267,Lisa,we've got to stop mom from going out with those women.
50268,Lisa,could we hurry this up? i am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
42078,Lisa,"my god, they are stubby."
50269,Lisa,"hey, does dad know you and the cool moms broke up?"
42083,Lisa,"if you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
50275,Lisa,"maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money."
50278,Lisa,"i love it. i know i use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
42087,Lisa,"okay, but if you really want to honk skinner off, i suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in."
42090,Lisa,"uh, i'll smoke it in class."
50284,Lisa,"mom, your choice to go back to blue is so empowering."
42093,Lisa,"well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
42101,Lisa,it's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
50294,Lisa,"the creative team from mixar! pardon me. i've seen all of your movies except ""cars,"" and i can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital rembrandts of my generation!"
42103,Lisa,checkers.
50297,Lisa,"""while beautiful, the desert also harbors hidden dangers: cacti, poisonous snakes, and most deadly of all--"
42107,Lisa,"close the gate, maggie."
42109,Lisa,have you found a picture yet?
50303,Lisa,this calls for some springfield silvertongue!
42114,Lisa,"""honey, i hit a school bus""!"
50311,Lisa,it was wrong of me to play goddess!
42123,Lisa,"come on, bart. if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
42129,Lisa,"i think you have to be more aggressive, sir."
50323,Lisa,the noisy minority... the upside-down bubblegum collective... the regional lampoon... the plymouth grok experiment... fro and flo... allan sherman's helter shmelter...
50326,Lisa,this is so sad. can we help her?
42136,Lisa,dad! dad! do you know what today is?
50328,Lisa,"so, how was your first day of school?"
50329,Lisa,"grampa, you're not dead."
50332,Lisa,you're out of tonic.
42143,Lisa,this award is the biggest farce i ever saw.
42144,Lisa,i stand corrected.
50336,Lisa,why did i suggest this?
42147,Lisa,unky herb!
42151,Lisa,eleven hundred and fifty bones.
42154,Lisa,i think we owe a debt to unky herb. he took us into his home and dad destroyed him.
42156,Lisa,"finally, a copy of ""ethan frome"" to call my own."
42158,Lisa,i've never gotten a b before.
50350,Lisa,looks like there was magic between you two.
42161,Lisa,perhaps i'm not making myself clear. i think you should reconsider.
50354,Lisa,hm.
42164,Lisa,"before i go to camp, i'll need boosters for malaria, german measles, encephalitis, hansen's disease..."
42165,Lisa,"don't patronize me, doctor."
42168,Lisa,this is a little more rustic than i expected.
42171,Lisa,"i feel like i'm gonna die, bart."
42176,Lisa,bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that krusty the clown will come through.
50370,Lisa,"shut up! now, where were we?"
50371,Lisa,"oh, it's a lot less dangerous than you think. you can see me do it again in a talent show next week."
50372,Lisa,there's no chance whatsoever. i'll show you.
50373,Lisa,you don't open the top -- the locks are real.
50374,Lisa,"the can is in two halves, and they slide apart."
50377,Lisa,haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face?
50384,Lisa,ricky jay? david copperfield? penn? teller?!?!
42193,Lisa,it's mom!
50387,Lisa,"raymondo, i knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep. raymondo?"
42196,Lisa,everybody was cheering for you.
42197,Lisa,"""our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy..."""
42203,Lisa,why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
50396,Lisa,"bart, you can find them by smell! that's amazing! restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
50401,Lisa,three more big ones and we'll talk.
42211,Lisa,i'm hideous.
50404,Lisa,we haven't even gotten our salads yet.
50405,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart! take the last truffle... do whatever you want. sell it, eat it..."
42217,Lisa,but that ride meant everything to him!
50412,Lisa,why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
50415,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but i don't love you, milhouse, and i never will."
50422,Lisa,taffy's up to something. and i won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. it's time to get boots on the ground.
50424,Lisa,who'd follow milhouse around like that? sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko.
42236,Lisa,hi fellas.
50431,Lisa,maggie's locked in!
42241,Lisa,from now i will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
50440,Lisa,get thee behind me namuche! that's the buddhist satan. let's give it a shot.
42255,Lisa,wait bart! maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell.
42258,Lisa,what are we going to have?
42262,Lisa,"bart, come quick! there's an itchy and scratchy movie!!!"
42266,Lisa,"it was the greatest movie i've ever seen in my life. and you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. dustin hoffman, michael jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
50458,Lisa,"jeez, they're dropping like flies."
42268,Lisa,"dad, you've got to let bart see that movie. i've never seen him like this. he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine."
50459,Lisa,the children are on bus 23.
50462,Lisa,"there's only one bed that's just right for me, the bed with the truth in it. which is probably the third one."
50463,Lisa,so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
50464,Lisa,that's where the ice bridge would be! go down!
50468,Lisa,skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
50469,Lisa,otto? are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?
50476,Lisa,please! i went through my t.r. phase in first grade. now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin.
42286,Lisa,"good luck in your trumped-up law suit, dad."
50478,Lisa,face on a dime!
42288,Lisa,"dad, that's not the real batman."
42290,Lisa,look! there we are!
42293,Lisa,but i'm a real tightwad. can i afford this remarkable system?
42295,Lisa,"ooh / meow / dad, stop you're embarrassing us / stop please."
42296,Lisa,promise you'll never do that again.
42299,Lisa,"well, don't push her. remember, ""tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
50494,Lisa,"""dearest marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."""
42305,Lisa,daaad!
42306,Lisa,mondale to hart: where's the beef?
42307,Lisa,davah hassahoff.
42312,Lisa,i don't see your name on it.
42315,Lisa,"huh, okay."
50507,Lisa,it's about an asteroid!
50510,Lisa,video game convention!
50511,Lisa,"this game has all the best college marching bands! from the precision footwork of ohio state to the lame, dead-on-arrival humor of stanford!"
42320,Lisa,eh.
50515,Lisa,fun dad rocks!
50518,Lisa,yes it is! that's all it is!
50520,Lisa,"mom, we're hungry!"
50521,Lisa,"relax, mom -- be adventurous."
42330,Lisa,hardly. i'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
42335,Lisa,we're under six!
50532,Lisa,"it's called ""el chemistri"" and they use science to make the food!"
42341,Lisa,goodbye dad! don't eat any solids.
50534,Lisa,"yeah-huh: athos, porthos, aramis and d'artagnan."
42346,Lisa,"there's ""surly""... and ""remorseful""."
42347,Lisa,this is a disgrace.
50539,Lisa,what?
42349,Lisa,"bart, quit it, bart. quit it, quit it, quit it!"
50549,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
42359,Lisa,"yes, principal skinner."
42365,Lisa,"oh, c'mon! hurry!"
42367,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
50562,Lisa,writing is the hardest thing ever!
50563,Lisa,coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to!
50564,Lisa,a dog wrote a bestseller?! aargh! all i've done is procrastinate! who am i kidding? there will never be a book with my name on it.
42374,Lisa,yeah. nice gag.
50566,Lisa,i'm in.
50569,Lisa,"aww, i've always wanted an aiden..."
50570,Lisa,"no, guys... it was me."
42385,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
50583,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story."
42394,Lisa,that story isn't suitable for children.
50588,Lisa,"well, i could help you..."
42397,Lisa,aw.
42399,Lisa,noooo!!
50591,Lisa,"we did it, bart! i'm a mentor!"
42405,Lisa,but couldn't we just give in to the british?
50600,Lisa,"well, you're not exactly my hero. i see you more as a cautionary tale."
42409,Lisa,i've got something for you.
42413,Lisa,just screwing with your mind.
42414,Lisa,i've grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with anabolic steroids.
50606,Lisa,i need my books!
50612,Lisa,"so, what's this with the gravy boat?"
50617,Lisa,"dad, you cannot endorse ted nugent. i mean, sure, we all love his music..."
42433,Lisa,oh no. i'll be socially unpopular. more so.
50626,Lisa,"hm, i kinda want to create my own thing. do you sell any just plain sets?"
50627,Lisa,"well, i'll just buy one of these and build something different."
42436,Lisa,mmmm.
42438,Lisa,the mirror. the mirror!
50632,Lisa,what the--
50634,Lisa,okay.
42443,Lisa,"like halloween and christmas, april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
42447,Lisa,dad! i was telling the story.
42448,Lisa,arrrgh!
50639,Lisa,all right already! i had no friends.
50642,Lisa,"nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!"
50643,Lisa,i never said it was diabolical!
50645,Lisa,hit refresh.
50646,Lisa,i have a thousand friends! and only eight of them are milhouse.
42455,Lisa,"i wish i'd gotten to know you better, dad. but there were times when we really connected."
42457,Lisa,why?
50651,Lisa,sherri? terri? hopscotch? double dutch? ringolivio? anyone?
50652,Lisa,"i have a thousand friends, and i feel more alone than ever!"
50659,Lisa,"even a kid who wears a ""finding nemo"" back brace has some pride. you went too far this time, bart."
50661,Lisa,your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable.
50662,Lisa,"yeah, yeah, okay, second closest."
50663,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, i didn't mean to be nosey."
42473,Lisa,"look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
50666,Lisa,"yep, you're the crack head. what dessert are you gonna get?"
42478,Lisa,"grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
50673,Lisa,"mom, i have a crush!"
42482,Lisa,yay!
50675,Lisa,the boy i like is hemingway-esque!
50676,Lisa,"wow, nick here in our house. i hope it doesn't make him think less of me."
42485,Lisa,"i guess nobody likes the truth, huh grampa."
50677,Lisa,"mom can't appreciate the kind of boy nick is, because although i love dad, he's a completely different creature."
50678,Lisa,nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths!
42489,Lisa,i learned how many drams in a pennyweight.
50685,Lisa,we could take this boat.
50689,Lisa,"wait, how long is this love for again?"
50690,Lisa,"hm, that's a pretty long time."
50691,Lisa,"thanks. but i couldn't have done it, mom. i mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life."
42501,Lisa,"oh, good idea! let's see... bass, bass... ""tiny tim""... ""the chipmunks greatest hits""... ""a castrato christmas""..."
50695,Lisa,"do we really have to sit here the whole time? i mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty."
42504,Lisa,now wait a minute. how can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you?
42508,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
50700,Lisa,"ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! y'know, i'm glad we're in exile."
50705,Lisa,"dad, i wanted to give you a heads-up. mom's birthday is tomorrow. it's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting."
42515,Lisa,it seems like i've been wearing the same red dress forever.
42516,Lisa,"oh mom, i've missed you so much."
42519,Lisa,i can't believe it. our first glimpse of gabbo!
42521,Lisa,"yeah, well krusty stole it from steve allen."
50713,Lisa,"just throw in a couple of ""fur is murders."""
42523,Lisa,no they don't.
50718,Lisa,we're actually entering dad's dreams?
42531,Lisa,you mean those diet milkshakes?
50725,Lisa,power's out.
50728,Lisa,"dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function."
42540,Lisa,but there are still a few things i don't get. like how come we never heard about this until today?
50733,Lisa,"hello, lovebirds."
50734,Lisa,"i've been following your storyline from afar, bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. perhaps i could broker a settlement."
42543,Lisa,"it's from my pen pal, anya!"
50738,Lisa,"face it, we're just kids. we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. all we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
42547,Lisa,"bart, i figured it out. who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years?"
42551,Lisa,sideshow bob!
42552,Lisa,"hey look! ""the fbi light opera society sings the complete gilbert and sullivan."""
50744,Lisa,two!?!!!
50745,Lisa,two diplomats' sons are in love with me. who will i choose: ghana or portugal?
42556,Lisa,no.
50749,Lisa,"bart, how could you?"
42562,Lisa,i heard about this. this is the one where scratchy finally gets itchy.
42565,Lisa,it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- can't we do something?
42566,Lisa,"no you didn't. you only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
50757,Lisa,"that's sexist, but thank you."
42571,Lisa,bobo. it's mr. burns' bear all right.
42572,Lisa,i think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
50763,Lisa,"well, he's tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes."
50767,Lisa,i just hope you're gonna take this seriously.
50774,Lisa,"bart, aren't you gonna tell mom and dad about the problem you have?"
42584,Lisa,"eww, dad, this is blood."
50786,Lisa,fifth-graders? ooh-la-la! they get to put their desks in a circle!
42595,Lisa,"no, dad."
42599,Lisa,grampa's a vampire?!
50791,Lisa,"look, if i could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, i think i might have a chance to..."
42603,Lisa,"happy halloween, everybody!"
50796,Lisa,oh god.
50797,Lisa,this is where i live.
42610,Lisa,"i always knew some day mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
42614,Lisa,i'm going to have my wedding here.
50807,Lisa,i denounce thee! i denounce thee! i denounce thee!
50810,Lisa,"dad, thank you. like always, the fact that i could tune you out without fearing i'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful i have been. which means i've got a train to catch."
42619,Lisa,this is madness. he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
42620,Lisa,is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
50816,Lisa,"i used to think that i was stupid, worthless, weak, and wrong"
42626,Lisa,"tsk, tsk. the remorse of the sugar junkie."
50818,Lisa,i was small inside and lacking pride...
50820,Lisa,"i love npr, and jazz guitar..."
42629,Lisa,"oh, bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
42638,Lisa,"excuse me, mr. mayor."
42639,Lisa,"this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my allowance. it isn't much, but i would like to help."
42641,Lisa,no. nevada makes my butt look big.
50834,Lisa,but...
50842,Lisa,"anyone who wants to be in this, grab a doublet and meet me backstage!"
42653,Lisa,dad!
42657,Lisa,"bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. that saxophone was my one creative outlet. it was the only way i could truly express myself."
50849,Lisa,huh?
42659,Lisa,what's the point of all these precautions? i've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
50853,Lisa,it's a black hole!
50857,Lisa,"dad, don't pat it!"
42666,Lisa,"oh, grampa. they pelted you too?"
42670,Lisa,why are you so happy?
42677,Lisa,this biography of bart came out awfully quickly. it's not even about him.
50869,Lisa,not the favorite! not the favorite!
50875,Lisa,a gentleman doesn't ask and a lady doesn't tell.
50880,Lisa,i hope you're happy. you all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class.
50881,Lisa,you put my college fund on a poker site?!
42691,Lisa,isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?
50888,Lisa,"new low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... i'm just gonna log right out."
42697,Lisa,awww.
42698,Lisa,awww.
50890,Lisa,huh. two queens. that's a great start.
50891,Lisa,"well, maybe i can just win the sixty-two dollars back."
42705,Lisa,"it's not funny, bart! millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! that they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
42708,Lisa,they cannot keep making dolls like this! something has to be done!
42717,Lisa,you're getting a job.
42722,Lisa,am i the first?
50919,Lisa,"mm, that is good grub."
42730,Lisa,make sure you get my mom's hair just right.
42731,Lisa,how about me?
42736,Lisa,really?
50928,Lisa,nooo!
50931,Lisa,i've been meat-walking!
42743,Lisa,"go, dad, go."
42744,Lisa,"what are you basing that on, mom?"
50938,Lisa,"willie, i love your chaps."
42747,Lisa,what's so special about this game anyway? it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville. they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
50940,Lisa,"dad, check this out!"
42752,Lisa,yeah. maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
50945,Lisa,whoa.
42755,Lisa,me too.
50952,Lisa,no matter where you go... i will find you!
42762,Lisa,"he can't just eat peanuts, dad. he needs plants to live."
42763,Lisa,"no, dad. he's grooming him."
50954,Lisa,"i love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name."
42768,Lisa,"dad, i think he's an ivory dealer. his boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and i'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
42775,Lisa,dad! you're sinking!
42776,Lisa,dad!
42777,Lisa,"dad, feline means cat."
42778,Lisa,dad!
50967,Lisa,what does that mean?
50968,Lisa,"every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities."
50971,Lisa,what happened with the e.m.p.?
42783,Lisa,"hey mom, bart's throwing peas."
50982,Lisa,"look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. so, do the ones you know first. if you don't know one, guess b and move on. now, what is the capital of massachusetts?"
50984,Lisa,i don't like this game! nobody likes this game! even the kids on the box look bored!
42795,Lisa,you started off as the bad cop. but now you're the good one. you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
50987,Lisa,no! outside the house!
42798,Lisa,you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
50990,Lisa,with nametags on them?
42800,Lisa,why?
42806,Lisa,"so bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?"
42809,Lisa,hot dogs / armour hot dogs...
42816,Lisa,yeesh. how much was it?
51011,Lisa,what?!
42822,Lisa,me too.
51015,Lisa,dad?!
51016,Lisa,"mom, i think maggie misses tv."
42827,Lisa,"dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. there's a reason two people come together and stay together. there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. if you want to get mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can."
42828,Lisa,no.
42830,Lisa,"i'm really glad you're back, dad. i knew you could do it. now don't screw it up."
42833,Lisa,time's up?!
42835,Lisa,dad...
42836,Lisa,dad...
51035,Lisa,property of abraham j. simpson? this is grampa's stuff!
42850,Lisa,"thanks, nelson."
42853,Lisa,"bart, i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately. i got carried away with being popular. but now that i'm unpopular again, i want you to know i'm here for you."
51050,Lisa,"well, while you're grading so generously... here's mine."
51051,Lisa,meat?!
42861,Lisa,"sorry, ralph. that would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation."
51055,Lisa,the joeys go in feet first!
42864,Lisa,"hi, allison? i'm lisa simpson. oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level."
42867,Lisa,"well, i'm sure i could have, but i'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends."
42869,Lisa,the sax.
51062,Lisa,principal skinner...
42871,Lisa,"wow, with so much in common, i'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
42872,Lisa,"me, too."
42877,Lisa,and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
51071,Lisa,my teacher's still bullying me.
51072,Lisa,that just made it worse.
51073,Lisa,"ms. cantwell, i can make this stop. all you have to do is... like me."
42884,Lisa,"i can't tell you either, ralph."
42887,Lisa,i don't need a card. you live in the room next to me.
42890,Lisa,"give it to me! hey wait, there's nothing bad here."
42891,Lisa,"i've got to stop being so petty. i should be allison's friend, not her competitor. i mean, she is a wonderful person."
42892,Lisa,i prefer my phrasing.
51083,Lisa,"that's right! bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids. mostly these kids. there's only so many kids."
42894,Lisa,oh really? i...
51086,Lisa,i find that a little hard to believe.
51087,Lisa,grampa's story was true?
42908,Lisa,"why, here's allison's real diorama. it got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
51101,Lisa,this skirt has a small splatter...
51102,Lisa,"splatter, as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand--"
51104,Lisa,what's that?
51106,Lisa,but how did you get the key?
42918,Lisa,"yes, i do. and just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
51110,Lisa,maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.
51112,Lisa,i think our lunches got mixed up.
51113,Lisa,milhouse? got anything good?
42924,Lisa,glad you liked it.
42928,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
42937,Lisa,that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
42938,Lisa,"sorry, mom. i've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me."
42943,Lisa,yayyyyyy!
51136,Lisa,"you know, in the middle ages people took refuge in church to escape the bubonic plague, but that made the plague spread even faster!"
51139,Lisa,"hey, i have a weakness for pomp!"
51140,Lisa,"mom, i found your wedding dress!"
42949,Lisa,yayyyy!
51141,Lisa,"using something this town has never ever seen: good, honest police work."
51150,Lisa,"dear she-done-left-me-records. once again, i write protesting your holographic exploitation of blues icon bleeding gums murphy. i call for a boycott and girl-cott of your entire catalogue until you... sonny rollins?!"
42960,Lisa,"don't do it, bart."
42961,Lisa,"dad, i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend."
51152,Lisa,"you're a hologram, aren't you?"
51153,Lisa,have you no shame?
51155,Lisa,"so you're saying moe's dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?"
51156,Lisa,that's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. we start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
42966,Lisa,"no, mom. he's right. observe."
51158,Lisa,something smells fishy.
42968,Lisa,"dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning. can we listen to something else?"
42970,Lisa,"dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is."
51162,Lisa,ki-ya!
51163,Lisa,it's for babies!
42973,Lisa,bart! your mortal enemy is on the radio!
42978,Lisa,there's no councilman les wynan.
42981,Lisa,"okay, aaron a. aaronson voted for... bob. aaron l. aaronson voted for... bob. arthur b. ablabab voted for... bob."
42984,Lisa,no edgar neubauer.
51179,Lisa,are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
51181,Lisa,dad! do we have to ride like this?
42991,Lisa,i have a plan. i think we can trap him.
42996,Lisa,ringo to his rest of the beatles!
43000,Lisa,what about grampa?
43002,Lisa,"mom, is dad gonna kill us?"
43003,Lisa,"dad, look!"
43004,Lisa,dad!! your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
51199,Lisa,dad's kneeling on a prayer mat! he doesn't believe in kneeling!
51200,Lisa,huh. it looks like he's praying...
51205,Lisa,"but, but--"
51207,Lisa,"i haven't heard anything about you, except from you."
43016,Lisa,"i can't believe it, bart. i'd always thought jessica was so sweet."
43017,Lisa,you gotta give her up.
43018,Lisa,"bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. except maybe that boy who works in the library."
43019,Lisa,well read and just a little wild. if only someone could tame him.
51208,Lisa,how much did you hear?
51211,Lisa,when what's all over?!
43022,Lisa,"bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
43025,Lisa,"there is someone among us with a guilty conscience. after much soul searching i decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but i urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of god, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
51218,Lisa,"but wait, wait, wait! what is this?"
43037,Lisa,ooooh.
43046,Lisa,"don't worry, bart, they won't bother you anymore."
43051,Lisa,"bart, just get out of here."
51251,Lisa,the students would do it.
51253,Lisa,"hello, children. i hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code."
43062,Lisa,"ew. bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. they go in the trash."
43063,Lisa,how did you get tickets?
51256,Lisa,now the class nerd. milhouse?
43066,Lisa,"eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. he will make the next few hours a living hell."
51258,Lisa,"no, this is good."
51259,Lisa,i got bart's backpack.
51263,Lisa,"oh my god, you found a loophole! why don't you just put this much inventiveness into your work?"
51264,Lisa,you've presented me with quite a conundrum.
43073,Lisa,"dad, you did it! i am so proud of you."
51268,Lisa,"well bart, is that enough of a sign for ya?"
51269,Lisa,did you know some historians think american football is based on an ancient aztec game?
43078,Lisa,yay!
51272,Lisa,"look, while i'd like to help, i'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances."
43082,Lisa,what do you think mom and dad are doing right now?
51275,Lisa,i can't believe he pays you so little. the crowd was crazy about you.
43084,Lisa,"i don't know. maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark."
43088,Lisa,"dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
43092,Lisa,"c'mon, bart. they're gonna pamper us. not literally, of course."
51287,Lisa,"that's it, maggie! use the dino-wand!"
51288,Lisa,me too.
51289,Lisa,one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do...
43098,Lisa,"mom, can we talk to you?"
43105,Lisa,warning. warning. doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores.
43109,Lisa,"you don't know what they do there, do you?"
51301,Lisa,isabel!
51305,Lisa,oh my god. someone wants to be my partner. can't screw this up.
51309,Lisa,a reagan republican?
43120,Lisa,yeah!
43122,Lisa,why don't we all look at the photo album?
43123,Lisa,aw.
51314,Lisa,"i'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, i'm not pigeonholing... is it a catholic thing?"
43126,Lisa,i think it's romantic. throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
51321,Lisa,"listen, i'm really sorry about..."
43130,Lisa,i hope it's a girl.
51326,Lisa,ew. how long has it been since you washed your stomach?
51328,Lisa,what are you doing?!
51330,Lisa,pour me another.
51341,Lisa,that's impossible. we've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
43151,Lisa,when krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away.
43153,Lisa,"yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as tom bosley. but krusty!"
43162,Lisa,"uh-huh. in fact, in rand-mcnally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people."
43164,Lisa,hey! i need that!
51357,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
51364,Lisa,what are you doing?
43174,Lisa,i'm impressed that you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
43179,Lisa,"hey dad, whatcha doing?"
51378,Lisa,"no, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
51380,Lisa,professor digglesby's wand! now i have every wizarding stick from the spells and potions department of wagglepoofs academy!
43190,Lisa,"uh, i wasn't talking about you, dad."
51382,Lisa,"now dad, i'd like to give you your present."
51384,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
51385,Lisa,"well, at least you're eating vegetables."
43195,Lisa,how did you know my name?
43197,Lisa,i'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.
51389,Lisa,"stop it, stop it! why in the world would you burn a book?"
43199,Lisa,"sorry, i don't believe in fortune telling. i should go."
43202,Lisa,"oh, that's cute."
43204,Lisa,guess so.
43207,Lisa,aaagh. him again.
43208,Lisa,"hello. i need ecosystem of the marsh, by thompson."
51400,Lisa,they're gonna take dad! we gotta do something!
43210,Lisa,that's the book i need. you'll probably take forever with it too.
51406,Lisa,the people of sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
43215,Lisa,he can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
43216,Lisa,"yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings."
51408,Lisa,these people hate my dad. how can they want to make a movie about him?
51412,Lisa,we'll explain it!
43226,Lisa,guess what -- hugh and i are getting married.
43227,Lisa,"mom, remember when i was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep dad from ruining it?"
43228,Lisa,"mom, it's a picture phone."
51422,Lisa,what? a rule's a rule.
43231,Lisa,"it's not you, milhouse. i just don't plan to ever get married."
51424,Lisa,that doesn't sound like you.
43235,Lisa,dad!
51428,Lisa,well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. want a hug?
43240,Lisa,"all right, dad! i'm sorry i left you alone with homer and bart."
43243,Lisa,"mom, i feel kinda funny wearing white - i mean, milhouse."
51435,Lisa,"overreactor dot org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are ""genetically modified organisms,"" whose effect on humans is... unknown!"
51442,Lisa,"well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people."
51444,Lisa,and i refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. mom?
43257,Lisa,are you saying we won't see my family again?
43258,Lisa,i can't believe i'm hearing this. i don't want to cut my family out of my life.
51449,Lisa,let's splice some d.n.a.!
43260,Lisa,maybe. but i still love them. and i don't think you understand that.
43261,Lisa,"wow. now that i know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?"
51450,Lisa,"bob, there's one thing i've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
51453,Lisa,i like the impressionists.
43267,Lisa,"if it wasn't you, then who was it?"
43269,Lisa,my bongo drums!
43272,Lisa,"look, it's twins!"
43274,Lisa,wow! twenty-five puppies!
51466,Lisa,how veiled?
51468,Lisa,"dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat grampa?"
51475,Lisa,"oh, my god -- i'm getting a guinea pig! thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!"
51476,Lisa,this one whistled at me!
43287,Lisa,we've gotta get you outta here!
43293,Lisa,but they're ours! you stole them from us!
43295,Lisa,nooo!!
43296,Lisa,"well, mr. burns, i hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion."
51492,Lisa,"oh my god, he's in the walls!"
43307,Lisa,"grade me! look at me! evaluate and rank me! oh -- i'm good, good, good, and oh so smart! grade me!"
51500,Lisa,that's a terrible thing for a father to do.
43310,Lisa,there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now. at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar.
43311,Lisa,"mom, i think he's serious."
51509,Lisa,"madame curie, we just might have this one in the bag."
43320,Lisa,what about your family?
51514,Lisa,"okay, dad's my hero. why is he my hero?"
51518,Lisa,...isn't rich...
43327,Lisa,"lift me, won't you lift me / above the old routine / make it nice, play it clean, jazzman..."
43328,Lisa,"when the jazzman's testi-fyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman, oh jazzman..."
43329,Lisa,"hey, bleeding gums! i was great! and i owe it all to..."
51522,Lisa,"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
51523,Lisa,"...and when my dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew i was diving."
51525,Lisa,that's what heroes do.
51527,Lisa,"oh, dad, you don't want details. no one wants to see the sausage being made."
43336,Lisa,"oh, dad!"
43337,Lisa,how come?
43338,Lisa,"uh, maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
43339,Lisa,grampa!
51531,Lisa,"don't do it, dad. don't cheat."
43342,Lisa,"that's maggie again, grampa."
51534,Lisa,"all right, you're hurt. i understand. but when i made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. you became the hero i thought you could be, dad."
43353,Lisa,where am i gonna get five hundred dollars?
43358,Lisa,"that was for you, bleeding gums."
51551,Lisa,"um, can i just have a slice?"
43361,Lisa,yay!
43362,Lisa,"when the jazzman's testi-fyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman, take my blues away ..."
51555,Lisa,hello?
43364,Lisa,"hey mom, is this how you caught him?"
51556,Lisa,dad? did you just call?
43370,Lisa,"mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad."
43372,Lisa,"bust 'im, mom! / get 'im, mom! / nail 'im! / you can do it!"
51566,Lisa,"oh dad, you're back! just in time for my recital!"
51569,Lisa,"see ya, homer! / bye, dad!"
51571,Lisa,now that's what i call a modern family.
51572,Lisa,can i make an observation?
43381,Lisa,"oh, no. that's awful, mr. puente. what? oh. he owns the nuclear power plant. yeah, i'd like to settle his hash, too."
43383,Lisa,"""marge, bart, lisa, and maggie."" dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
51577,Lisa,what's for dinner?
43390,Lisa,could not!
43391,Lisa,could not!
51584,Lisa,what do you want?
43394,Lisa,look at burns' suit. yeesh.
43395,Lisa,"actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is. the rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
43396,Lisa,"well, i don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
51587,Lisa,mom paid her to be my friend?
51589,Lisa,neither do you!
51591,Lisa,answer me!
51597,Lisa,"but when i grow up, i'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever. and i'll always love you."
51598,Lisa,happy mother's day.
43407,Lisa,burns' suit! burns' suit!
43410,Lisa,"okay, mom. anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. like those fingerprints. they could've gotten on the gun some other way."
51603,Lisa,and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.
51604,Lisa,hey! are you coming to the afterschool pool party?
43415,Lisa,"so, the d.n.a. was right. it must've been... oh, dad!"
51607,Lisa,mom! i'm narrating!
43418,Lisa,"or from your point of view, m and s... maggie simpson."
43419,Lisa,"yeah, that's how fast grampa is shrinking."
43420,Lisa,"cheer up, bart. milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low."
51613,Lisa,"with his mom gone, homer needed a hero. and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls."
51616,Lisa,"while bart was in hell, homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
51618,Lisa,"which meant that at long last, my brother could get a good night's sleep."
43432,Lisa,"i thought i could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
43434,Lisa,yeah. the sun is still out.
51628,Lisa,"wrapping you in bubble wrap. i can't always be around to protect you, so it will."
43442,Lisa,"let's see. dirt... dirt... well, there wasn't really much dirt."
51637,Lisa,"dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating."
51643,Lisa,"this is so sad. in his homeland, dad was a nuclear engineer."
51644,Lisa,"no, no. you want to make american kids work?"
43453,Lisa,how're the southwestern pizza fingers?
51650,Lisa,hey!
43463,Lisa,i can't eat this. i can't eat a poor little lamb!
43466,Lisa,no.
43468,Lisa,dad... those all come from the same animal.
43469,Lisa,"oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism."
51662,Lisa,oh no! you're not leaving me to clean this up!
43476,Lisa,"i never realized before, but some itchy and scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
43477,Lisa,come to homer's bbbq. the extra b is for byobb.
43479,Lisa,mom.
51671,Lisa,a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need... my hero...
43482,Lisa,stop it! stop it! don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
43487,Lisa,"bart, tell dad i'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
51682,Lisa,"regardless, i see no reason to believe that ""bender"" is from the future. robotic technology today is very advanced."
43493,Lisa,tofu?
51685,Lisa,"what stopped you, bender? asimov's three laws of robotics?"
43495,Lisa,that's cute.
43499,Lisa,"wow, paul mccartney! i read about you in history class. but where's your wife, linda?"
43500,Lisa,"apu, i'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."
51694,Lisa,attention goblins: madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars. and people are laying fingers all over them.
43503,Lisa,"you don't eat cheese, apu?"
51696,Lisa,"wait, wait, wait! you're the portal. how are you going to get to the future?"
43505,Lisa,"wow, that'd be great!"
51697,Lisa,why are you wearing your hat at dinner?
43507,Lisa,"actually dad, this time i was wrong..."
51700,Lisa,parking lot.
43509,Lisa,"while i was gone, i got some really good advice from paul and linda mccartney."
43524,Lisa,"okay, but promise you won't be grouchy."
51716,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't be jealous of apu. remember, it's all about the music."
51719,Lisa,"well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-saharan african music, but the rest will have to wait. bart, bart, i hear mom sobbing and i don't know where dad is!"
43531,Lisa,"well, we're calling it now."
51727,Lisa,are we there yet?
43536,Lisa,dad--
51728,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
51731,Lisa,are we there yet?
43541,Lisa,neat!
51733,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
43544,Lisa,i would if i could.
43547,Lisa,"well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. the longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
43550,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing down there?"
51743,Lisa,you mean like europeans were to the native americans? or the belgians were to the congo?
51746,Lisa,"so, you use a lot of solar energy?"
43556,Lisa,mom! dad! bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
51751,Lisa,i thought it was a ball!
51755,Lisa,knot with a k.
51758,Lisa,"um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
51759,Lisa,really? but i thought...
43569,Lisa,how did you survive?
43570,Lisa,"no, dad, it's a rhetorical question."
43575,Lisa,he framed krusty. he tried to kill aunt selma. he rigged an election.
51767,Lisa,so... where is he gonna sleep?
51772,Lisa,"look, dad had to get cured some time. there's nothing we can do about it."
51773,Lisa,whoa! looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak.
51774,Lisa,a bald eagle!
43586,Lisa,"huh? hurry up, mom and dad are probably worried sick."
51780,Lisa,"hi, i didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with mr. musk. it is such an honor."
43591,Lisa,he's getting away!
43593,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
51785,Lisa,bye!
43595,Lisa,"i will, mom."
43596,Lisa,bedbugs?
43597,Lisa,i'll be lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
51787,Lisa,foolish boy. you'll never guess elon musk's master password.
43601,Lisa,"oh no. inside, the evil bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
51793,Lisa,"i still believe in this town... a town that deserves its own original song! and as an aspiring musician with off-broadway dreams, i'm the one to write it!"
51796,Lisa,mr. teeny?
51797,Lisa,you've got a gift!
43606,Lisa,christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship jesus christ.
51801,Lisa,i think we might just make a good team. like maggie and grampa.
43611,Lisa,"goodnight, mom."
51804,Lisa,that works.
51806,Lisa,we've got a big sinkhole...
51809,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
51810,Lisa,do you really think that we can write a song that does that?
43619,Lisa,"no, grampa, don't!"
51812,Lisa,"take it, bart!"
43621,Lisa,who are they?
43629,Lisa,i don't know what mom's thinking. this whole country club scene is so decadent...
43630,Lisa,"all these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. it just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses i'm sorry. i gotta go!"
43631,Lisa,"mom, look! i found something more fun than complaining!"
43632,Lisa,"mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'cause i heard--"
51824,Lisa,you're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
51828,Lisa,i'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!
43638,Lisa,"wow, two finds in one store! what are the odds?"
51830,Lisa,i can't believe you're gambling.
51831,Lisa,i know how much to tip a waiter.
51835,Lisa,ooh.
43644,Lisa,i won't say anything controversial.
51841,Lisa,"oh, no!"
43657,Lisa,"it's hopeless, bart. we've searched up and down these docks, from pier one to that pier 1 by pier seventeen."
43659,Lisa,hey! you've got a pacemaker scar just like krusty!
43661,Lisa,or kill us.
43662,Lisa,"yeah, krusty doesn't want to be a clown. he's happy just being another blue-collar bozo."
51854,Lisa,"yeah, mom, hurry up."
51861,Lisa,he's the bullfighter.
51866,Lisa,"yeah, dad. you can do it!"
43679,Lisa,you do?
51871,Lisa,yeah!
51874,Lisa,wow!
43683,Lisa,"that won't help, dad. no one's ever going to believe me."
43693,Lisa,he wouldn't let me put it up.
51885,Lisa,me first!
51887,Lisa,me!
43696,Lisa,i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
43704,Lisa,"but i've caused so much trouble already, general washington. i can't go on."
43710,Lisa,stop it! where's the silver tongue?!
51903,Lisa,we would if we had one.
51904,Lisa,ogre is such a strong word.
43726,Lisa,will do.
51921,Lisa,"you'll never get one now, mr. name-caller."
51922,Lisa,"you weren't thinking, were you?"
51925,Lisa,then what am i?
51928,Lisa,"open your mouth, and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise."
51929,Lisa,"look, janey, cupcakes."
43743,Lisa,i don't understand it. we're always the ones who solve these problems.
43744,Lisa,"dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
51938,Lisa,"yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?"
51945,Lisa,"every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. and we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable..."
51947,Lisa,"in other words, to dodge the ball."
43756,Lisa,"houston, we have a problem. homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
51948,Lisa,i'm too sad.
51954,Lisa,is not.
43768,Lisa,we could have a slumber party.
43771,Lisa,"who do you love most: me, bart, or maggie?"
51966,Lisa,yeah.
43775,Lisa,"dad, you tell everybody everything. even moe knew when i threw up on the dentist."
51967,Lisa,"i have problems, too."
43779,Lisa,"thanks, dad. oh, this has been the best spring break ever!"
43780,Lisa,"so how's the national grammar rodeo, bart?"
43781,Lisa,"i knew it! i knew it because why would they have our national grammar rodeo in another nation?! oh, bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
51975,Lisa,i feel more popular already.
51980,Lisa,"no, sir."
51982,Lisa,"okay, mom."
43793,Lisa,waaa! uhh! there's gum in my hair!
51988,Lisa,"we're playing ""what's that odor?""."
51989,Lisa,"you win, bart."
43799,Lisa,my scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
51995,Lisa,you are?
51997,Lisa,"should maggie be going with them, mom?"
51998,Lisa,i hope maggie and the boys are all right.
51999,Lisa,"yeah, i suppose so. night mom."
43809,Lisa,"wow, he's even more agitated than usual. maybe we should let him stay."
43812,Lisa,"by your logic, i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
43815,Lisa,"but i don't see any tigers around here, do you?"
43816,Lisa,"actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
43817,Lisa,that's the home-owner tax.
43818,Lisa,"i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad."
52010,Lisa,maybe one more.
43827,Lisa,"you know, apu, in a way, all americans are immigrants -- except native americans."
43828,Lisa,"no, i mean american indians."
43830,Lisa,"dad? please just drive the car, dad."
52024,Lisa,"are you going bowling again tonight, mom?"
52025,Lisa,"oh, bart, don't you see? this is what psychologists call over-compensation. mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing."
52027,Lisa,"yes, you are."
43837,Lisa,it smells like otto's jacket.
43841,Lisa,"shh, mom. dad needs our support."
43842,Lisa,that song is so lame.
52043,Lisa,"'bye, bart."
43853,Lisa,wha?
43856,Lisa,friends? hah! these are my only friends...
43861,Lisa,"a microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was i thinking?"
52056,Lisa,"bart, i have something to say that's gonna bother me if i don't say it... it's good to see you."
43868,Lisa,"mom, come here. bring money."
52060,Lisa,i didn't do it!
43872,Lisa,i don't see any kids at all. it's like they ditched me in advance.
52067,Lisa,you do? why?
43878,Lisa,a compliment!
43879,Lisa,thanks. umm... you guys skate?
52072,Lisa,"don't you remember the get-well card we sent to krusty? it was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in."
52073,Lisa,wait a minute. krusty can't read.
43886,Lisa,"that's my dorky little brother, bart --tholomew."
52079,Lisa,"bart, there's one left and it's mine!"
52081,Lisa,"uh-oh, school bus."
43896,Lisa,what's he doing here?
52092,Lisa,"oh, no, bart, we'll have nightmares."
52094,Lisa,"one eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal..."
43903,Lisa,"ohmigod, bart, look!"
52096,Lisa,finally!
52097,Lisa,i'm calling to report the babysitter bandit. she's in our house right --
43906,Lisa,"oh. thanks, bart."
43908,Lisa,"did you hear that, bart?"
43912,Lisa,hurry up! mom and dad'll be home soon!
43913,Lisa,"bart, do you think it's safe?"
52106,Lisa,"well, okay. i got an a on my vocabulary test."
43916,Lisa,"i believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
43918,Lisa,"mom, hugo's eating his napkin!"
52110,Lisa,"i heard you last night, bart. you prayed for this. now your prayers have been answered. i'm no theologian. i don't know who or what god is exactly. all i know is he's a force more powerful than mom and dad put together and you owe him big."
52111,Lisa,an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
52114,Lisa,"... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, ""we have traced the call. it's coming from the floor below you. get out of the house!"" but it was too late. end of story."
52115,Lisa,is too.
52121,Lisa,did too.
52122,Lisa,did too.
52123,Lisa,it looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
43935,Lisa,ba-rt stop it!
52127,Lisa,that's okay.
43937,Lisa,"well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
43941,Lisa,"oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. bart's just my brother."
43945,Lisa,"oh, great. i'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
43946,Lisa,shouldn't you people be groveling? and bring me some shoes. nice ones!
43948,Lisa,yeah. did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking each other down? i've never been to a place like that before.
43949,Lisa,yayyy!
43951,Lisa,oooh! aaah! ohhh!
52149,Lisa,"bart, he's establishing mood."
43962,Lisa,"mom's right, dad. the odds against you winning are a thousand to one."
52154,Lisa,"my brother's using worms but i who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing."
43966,Lisa,what a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day!
43967,Lisa,"it's not foilage, mom. it's foliage. fo-li-age."
52158,Lisa,"hmmm. well as long as i'm asking something, can i ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?"
52162,Lisa,"mr. burns, i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish."
52164,Lisa,"yeah, you throw like me."
52173,Lisa,there he is!
52177,Lisa,"and i'm studying for the math fair. if i win, i'll bring home a brand new protractor."
43987,Lisa,"hi, dad. you know, there's buns in the cabinet."
52180,Lisa,"i know. it's times like this that i'm thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do. bart, i think i can help you."
43993,Lisa,"who does nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
43997,Lisa,"no, sir. i was laughing at something outside."
44001,Lisa,"wow, that was a good idea. and i can't believe it came from nelson."
44002,Lisa,"milhouse, i've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but i've never felt this way before. i think i have a crush..."
44003,Lisa,...on nelson muntz.
52193,Lisa,"bart, i have a riddle for you: what's the sound of one hand clapping?"
44006,Lisa,"would you do me a favor? when you get back to class, just give him this note."
44007,Lisa,please?
44008,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm so sorry..."
52198,Lisa,the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. all you have to do is hit the ball here.
44014,Lisa,snowball! i - don't - understand. she loves to climb in h--
44017,Lisa,"oh, please. milhouse likes vaseline on toast."
52209,Lisa,"bart, cut it out!"
44032,Lisa,"isn't it nice up here? what are you thinking, nelson?"
44033,Lisa,about anything.
44042,Lisa,meet me at the back door!
44045,Lisa,you lied to me.
44047,Lisa,"no. you don't understand, nelson. a kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
52241,Lisa,"oh, bart, i hope you're not taking this seriously. even a five-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet."
44054,Lisa,i suppose it could be almost anybody...
44058,Lisa,i think a hurricane is coming!
44060,Lisa,we better pick up some supplies.
52260,Lisa,all right!
44069,Lisa,not me.
44070,Lisa,i'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
44071,Lisa,"i saw it, bart."
52263,Lisa,and janey and i went bird watching. we saw a grackle.
44073,Lisa,out back.
52266,Lisa,"hello, dr. hibbert."
52267,Lisa,"dad, may i please make an observation?"
44078,Lisa,"it's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! oh, and you, dad. heh heh..."
52270,Lisa,"well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the..."
44080,Lisa,i think there must be a more logical explanation. and i think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
44083,Lisa,"mom, this is no time to be conservative. let's roll the dice here."
52279,Lisa,"please, dad."
44090,Lisa,"hi, mr. smithers!"
52286,Lisa,i can dig it!
52287,Lisa,john shaft.
52289,Lisa,why?
52294,Lisa,how romantic.
44105,Lisa,but he didn't do anything!
52297,Lisa,"so, it was love at first sight."
52299,Lisa,"everything i know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
44108,Lisa,if you wish to be our sitter / please be sweet and never bitter / help us with math and book reports /
52302,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
52307,Lisa,"but everybody does it! i mean, we're stealing cable as we speak."
44119,Lisa,"oh shary bobbins, this is ever so much fun!"
52318,Lisa,i just want to call attention to the fact that i'm not watching this fight. it's my form of non-violent protest.
44129,Lisa,good-bye shary bobbins!
44132,Lisa,ok. / guess so. / sounds good to me./ let's go.
44136,Lisa,me! / i would! /
44137,Lisa,"um, excuse me, sir. the thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. but after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
44140,Lisa,"no, it's not your fault, dad. you did fine. it's just that poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. you can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
44141,Lisa,yes. terrible.
44142,Lisa,i guess...
52333,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?
52336,Lisa,"no, sir. i can assure you i am not."
44145,Lisa,"wow! an actual robot from the movie ""clank! clank! you're dead!"""
52338,Lisa,marco!
44147,Lisa,please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery.
52339,Lisa,watch me dive! watch me dive! watch me dive!
52340,Lisa,you weren't watching! you weren't watching! you weren't watching!
44150,Lisa,i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
44152,Lisa,no. they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it.
44160,Lisa,bob's trailer at the construction site?
44166,Lisa,you cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! that's what happened.
44168,Lisa,"it's hopeless. utterly, utterly hopeless."
44170,Lisa,"um, do you know what you're doing?"
52364,Lisa,"ooh... phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? oh, do your own homework, bart!"
44180,Lisa,"please, please, please!"
52378,Lisa,"huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab."
44188,Lisa,"thank you, dr. hibbert. your trust means so much to me."
44190,Lisa,"you look so glamorous, mom! oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!"
52383,Lisa,discount lion safari!
44192,Lisa,"bart, i know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but i'm not some ogre. i think you will find me fair and fun."
44193,Lisa,"you should wash up for dinner. to make it fun, you can use the mr. bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
44194,Lisa,certainly.
52392,Lisa,this is a rather shameless promotion.
44203,Lisa,"come on, maggie... good maggie... the talcum powder's not to play with..."
52399,Lisa,mommy! i want my mommy!
52402,Lisa,"oh mom, i can't believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher."
44211,Lisa,i didn't see any u.f.o.!
52404,Lisa,maybe you could take a class at springfield community college.
44213,Lisa,"bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when mom and dad get home. now go to bed!"
44217,Lisa,go to your bed!
44218,Lisa,i'll make you!
52412,Lisa,i believe i know the answer.
52414,Lisa,"um, one: your belt buckle says ""state of texas"", but texas wasn't a state until 1845."
44228,Lisa,"no! as your babysitter, i order you to stop hitting your head on the wall!"
44229,Lisa,"bart? did you stop because i said to? if so, thank you."
44230,Lisa,bart?
44231,Lisa,911
52422,Lisa,i can't.
52427,Lisa,"-- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. i think they're called the eye teeth."
52428,Lisa,"i don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect."
44238,Lisa,"please, maggie, please go to sleep!"
44242,Lisa,oh god! where's bart?!
44246,Lisa,"hey, bart. how's your arm?"
52438,Lisa,when?
52447,Lisa,can i wear your jewelry?
52453,Lisa,does bart have to be there?
44263,Lisa,"oh, foreign language institute. oh, my german verb wheel!"
52455,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom, we request the pleasure of your company... no... mr. bergstrom, if you're not doing anything this friday... no... mr. bergstrom, do you like pork chops... oh no, of course you wouldn't..."
52457,Lisa,"i'm lisa -- peppy, blonde, and stunning! / sophomore prom queen five years running! goooooo lisa!"
52459,Lisa,"look everybody, maggie got her first tooth!"
44270,Lisa,"no. they went for a walk with the flanders. bart, what's going on? why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
52463,Lisa,there must be some way out of this verdammten spell.
52464,Lisa,"oh, that's an excellent use of a genius brain: to look after an idiot head."
52466,Lisa,"and furthermore,"
44277,Lisa,"well, i won't tell mom and dad, but only because i want the dog back. just try not to freak out the blind man."
52469,Lisa,"oh, you poor thing -- this is a tough time of year for someone who's allergic to holly, mistletoe, the red part of candy canes..."
44280,Lisa,and you have to cut these up first. otherwise animals get caught in them.
52473,Lisa,'s okay. but you know who took her side? marge boooouuuuvier simpson!
52477,Lisa,how do i get down?
52483,Lisa,"google, even though you've enslaved half the world, you're still a damn fine search engine."
52487,Lisa,i was worried! i thought i would find...
44298,Lisa,no.
44299,Lisa,you again.
52497,Lisa,"yes, well, uh..."
52498,Lisa,but doctor... he's so much more interesting this way.
44308,Lisa,i'd love to -- partner!
52501,Lisa,"mom, i've gotta know. once and for all, what is the secret? why did you stay with dad so long?"
52509,Lisa,how did my daughter turn into my brother?
52510,Lisa,you parked the car. that helped.
44319,Lisa,"wow! i've never seen so much money! oh, but i can't accept that, knowing where it came from. can i, mom?"
52511,Lisa,maybe my mom would have some ideas...
52512,Lisa,you could go back to michigan -- it's still under sharia law.
52513,Lisa,she told me to relax and bake cookies!
52514,Lisa,"oh, isn't that a little dangerous?"
44326,Lisa,what the heck is that?
44330,Lisa,"look, we got a package from the mr. sparkle company in japan!"
44334,Lisa,did you see that?
52528,Lisa,"as i told you when we talked last month, i've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead."
44343,Lisa,"chief wiggum, i can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
44344,Lisa,"oh, miss hoover, movies are a nice break, but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging?"
44350,Lisa,and so am i!
44352,Lisa,yes.
44353,Lisa,all i want is a chance to prove myself.
44359,Lisa,"hey, what about me? i'm a lowly maggot!"
44366,Lisa,okay. i'm not gonna give up. solitude never hurt anyone. emily dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! and went crazy as a loon.
44371,Lisa,this wasn't in the brochure.
44372,Lisa,"meet me at the eliminator"" after lights out. p.s. the cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
44374,Lisa,"i can't do this, bart. i'm not strong enough."
44375,Lisa,duh! a challenge i could do.
44379,Lisa,"oh, if only i were in springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. oh, god, i'm delirious!"
44385,Lisa,hey!!
44386,Lisa,"dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!"
44387,Lisa,"""dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan..."""
44388,Lisa,"""...if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the east river at your expense."""
44390,Lisa,"aw, i'd love to see new york. we could all go with the bus company's special supersitter fare!"
44392,Lisa,i just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
44393,Lisa,we're here!
44400,Lisa,kickin' it! a musical journey through the betty ford center.
44406,Lisa,sgt. skinner was a hero. he risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
44410,Lisa,"but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!"
44411,Lisa,you'll practice me? what does that mean? is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
44423,Lisa,two apples!
44430,Lisa,"well, don't worry about me, dad. it's not how it looks, it's how it sounds."
44438,Lisa,"wow, look at all these gadgets! if i were a nerd, i'd be in heaven."
44440,Lisa,"mom, stop! according to this, it says bart mixed up his dna with a fly's. i think that's bart!"
44445,Lisa,"oh no! and i let him use my toothbrush! well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me."
44446,Lisa,"mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!"
44451,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
44453,Lisa,"dad, that's our house."
44455,Lisa,hey look. it's pelé!
44458,Lisa,all right. go ahead.
44462,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
44465,Lisa,"can we go swimmin', mom?"
44468,Lisa,this bed is making me nauseous. why won't it stop?!
44471,Lisa,"mom, mom. i stepped in a bear trap."
44493,Lisa,you did. his name was stampy. you loved him.
44501,Lisa,"mr. hutz, we won."
44507,Lisa,everybody! come quick!
44508,Lisa,"look, there's more. what the heck is this thing?"
44518,Lisa,what about that sign right there?
44525,Lisa,inconclusive? then why did you come running up like that?
44528,Lisa,"ugh, those morons make me so angry."
44534,Lisa,"i just think it's a fantasy. if you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
44545,Lisa,"i don't understand, professor. why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
44547,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. we'll help you study."
44562,Lisa,dad...
44568,Lisa,here comes santa claus / here comes santa claus / right down santa claus lane... vixen and blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...
44574,Lisa,i think they're running out of tomatoes.
44581,Lisa,hey!
44589,Lisa,we can't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast.
44590,Lisa,there is something worse...
44601,Lisa,i want some fried sugar!
44605,Lisa,"why did you shudder just now, mom?"
44606,Lisa,ewww!
44612,Lisa,"oh, no! the spit valve! release the spit valve!"
44617,Lisa,"dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
44627,Lisa,yayyy!
44628,Lisa,but we heard them hovering!
44638,Lisa,she's really hungry.
44644,Lisa,wait! we're not savages! we live in a society of law. milhouse has the right to a fair trial!
44645,Lisa,"your honor, the defense calls its first and only witness: milhouse van houten."
44648,Lisa,milhouse! i am defending you!
44655,Lisa,run-a-way!
44656,Lisa,"aw, crud. / aw, come on, man."
44658,Lisa,we should be safe in here.
44660,Lisa,stop! you are in violation of the model u.n. charter!
44675,Lisa,"i love you, mom!"
44679,Lisa,"dad, we're the visitors."
44681,Lisa,it's the kind john glenn eats when he's not in space.
44686,Lisa,"okay, let's see, it's not egyptian. it's not prince's names."
44693,Lisa,it's a pig!
44698,Lisa,it can't just be a bad day. i feel like i'm getting dumber by the minute.
44700,Lisa,"wow, dad was a good speller?"
44702,Lisa,this is just two years ago!
44705,Lisa,"wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
44709,Lisa,that didn't answer anything. i need more information.
44720,Lisa,easy does it now... easy... little more... yea... right... that's the spot... ooah!
44724,Lisa,"dear log: it won't be long now before my mind melts into a soft simpsony sludge. soon, the arts and literature i love will be replaced by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps. it's time to give my brain its last meal."
44728,Lisa,"ah, they just came for the buffalo wings. but you really got through to me."
44729,Lisa,"yeah, while you still can... thanks!"
44733,Lisa,i'm supposed to talk to you about proposition 305...
44738,Lisa,why bother?
44742,Lisa,so all the simpson women turn out okay?
44744,Lisa,"oh dad, i've never been happier to be your daughter."
44747,Lisa,what a whimsical building! who says science can't be fun?
44756,Lisa,"good luck, dad. although i am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part."
44762,Lisa,dad!
44771,Lisa,"well, we used to date. plus, he threatened me."
44772,Lisa,"back off, bart. this may be the only chance i get as a second grader to produce my own tv show, and i'm not gonna let you screw it up."
44779,Lisa,"sorry, bart, but you've got to take some things seriously."
44792,Lisa,it's lisa.
44793,Lisa,they want cheap sentiment? i'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
44794,Lisa,"they call her the cat lady. people say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. but can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
44795,Lisa,the old union pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
44801,Lisa,stop talking like that! stop it!
44812,Lisa,"no, you can't hurt bart. he's... well, he's... your son!"
44815,Lisa,"you know, bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news."
44821,Lisa,"yeah dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize."
44826,Lisa,"you know dad, there's a lesson in all this. many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just..."
44829,Lisa,"but dad, you can't cram garbage under springfield forever."
44840,Lisa,what if i took a bus?
44854,Lisa,"i'm sorry, it's just that on the school bus--"
44857,Lisa,never mind.
44869,Lisa,"well, um, i'm kind of lost. can you tell me where i am?"
44871,Lisa,yahhh!
44881,Lisa,hurry! hurry! lower the bridge!
44882,Lisa,"dad, grab onto it!"
44885,Lisa,"i should have known i wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but i really wanted to see that exhibit. i'll never take another stupid risk like that again!"
44888,Lisa,dad! you're headed for the river again!
44904,Lisa,"it's kind of humbling, isn't it? the music we just heard might never be heard again."
44917,Lisa,do you know you have your hands in each other's pockets?
44918,Lisa,"wow! an alternate ending to ""casablanca!"" bart, this could be priceless!"
44924,Lisa,"look, dad, they've got every kind of paper! looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!"
44929,Lisa,"come on, bart. the bus is here."
44931,Lisa,did she just tell me to shut up?
44932,Lisa,you'll want a locker in this hallway -- it's library-adjacent.
44964,Lisa,date?
44965,Lisa,you guys have dates?
44969,Lisa,"i don't want a date! and i don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! am i the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""the mclaughlin group?"""
44970,Lisa,hel-lo?
44973,Lisa,"hey, guys."
44974,Lisa,no doubt! can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
44975,Lisa,"oh. so, i guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?"
44977,Lisa,unbelievable!
44981,Lisa,"ah. what am i doing? this isn't me. i'm sorry, milhouse."
44992,Lisa,"oh, i don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
44999,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was work?"
45005,Lisa,"that, too. he also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car."
45013,Lisa,"somebody had to tell him, mom. in the long run, it's much kinder to--"
45018,Lisa,"mom, they put every kid in america in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. it's all a big scam."
45019,Lisa,"move it, poky."
45020,Lisa,"uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?"
45025,Lisa,wanna comb it?
45030,Lisa,"that never happened, dad."
45036,Lisa,wow. did you know they had those web flaps for gliding?
45039,Lisa,but then we're stuck with gorillas!
45040,Lisa,"i don't get it, bart. you got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all."
45050,Lisa,"ohh, bart, that's plutonium. it's highly unstable."
45061,Lisa,me too.
45062,Lisa,poor maggie. if only you could tell us what's happening to you.
45064,Lisa,dad! wake up! wake up! wake up!
45065,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. anyway, you promised to take us to the lake."
45067,Lisa,"dad, you really should be watching the road."
45072,Lisa,of course not.
45075,Lisa,"hey, dad, it says they need your full name. you only put down your middle initial."
45082,Lisa,lobsters need salt water.
45087,Lisa,but i'm hardly learning at all.
45094,Lisa,i am just four power wands away from an anti-gravity lozenge. hope i don't run into that weird little troll!
45101,Lisa,"oh, i really need one more day, mom. i think the germs are regrouping. now for breakfast i'll have hash browns, coffee and a short stack. and would it kill you to heat up the syrup?"
45103,Lisa,"""the wind in the willows?"" oh yeah, ralph brought it over."
45108,Lisa,"brown, brown, brown..."
45111,Lisa,bart?! shouldn't you be in class?
45115,Lisa,forget it. i'd rather get a zero.
45117,Lisa,"well, i guess i was just on a roll."
45122,Lisa,can't you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?
45124,Lisa,"no! i never cheated before, and i never will again! oh, i almost wish i hadn't gotten away with it."
45126,Lisa,"stop it! i cheated! cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated!"
45140,Lisa,"but, mom--"
45144,Lisa,"hey, dad, that light says, ""check engine."""
45155,Lisa,hi.
45158,Lisa,"that ""change"" was a bribe."
45162,Lisa,"dad, we hit don rickles!"
45165,Lisa,"why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?"
45171,Lisa,whoa / curfew?
45172,Lisa,but it's not fair. adults always blame kids for everything!
45175,Lisa,"ooh, ""the game of lent."""
45177,Lisa,drinking their coffee...
45183,Lisa,wait! we don't need supernatural powers! we already know their secrets.
45184,Lisa,great. this is all gold.
45190,Lisa,i warned you guys that seniors always vote in record numbers.
45192,Lisa,but it's nine digits now. what's the point of these other four numbers?
45195,Lisa,it is to me.
45200,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
45206,Lisa,"so, is he alive or not?"
45213,Lisa,max power??
45214,Lisa,we should really put that in the corner.
45222,Lisa,"there's an opening, mom!"
45226,Lisa,"mom, bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
45228,Lisa,bart! that's tomorrow night's dinner.
45239,Lisa,"okay, dad, we're ready."
45245,Lisa,it encapsulates america and makes history come alive!
45248,Lisa,"hey, how come the smithsonian needs to be sponsored by a cel phone company?"
45252,Lisa,how can they put a prop from a tv show next to the bill of rights?
45260,Lisa,"i can't believe you did this, dad. why didn't you put that thing in your room?"
45262,Lisa,"until you taped over it, ""the little mermaid."""
45265,Lisa,"ugh, this is not gonna work."
45275,Lisa,that's awful!
45276,Lisa,"ooh, my stomach hurts."
45277,Lisa,"mom, i don't feel so good."
45283,Lisa,"you know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. and just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!"
45288,Lisa,i'll take two hours.
45296,Lisa,"gee, i should cut dad some slack. after all, he did take me to the ballet, and the smithsonian exhibit... in fact, he takes me lots of places he hates."
45299,Lisa,"not to me, dad."
45305,Lisa,we're buying a new doorbell?
45308,Lisa,"oh, milhouse is selling seeds! and he's coming this wa... oh, the birds got him."
45312,Lisa,why is it playing over again?
45318,Lisa,"it's a plague, you moron! and we've got lots more planned, and there's nothing you can do about it!"
45333,Lisa,"where are you going with that junk, dad?"
45334,Lisa,"well, if it'll help - um, mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy."
45341,Lisa,"no, dad, no. my point is you have to do something big and daring."
45348,Lisa,g-52.
45351,Lisa,their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.
45355,Lisa,"the elderly aren't like you or me, bart. they thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
45363,Lisa,they don't even seem to care that it's medication time.
45366,Lisa,what the heck's going on?
45367,Lisa,why don't you finish your own darn...
45371,Lisa,"ooh, i hear this really sucks. hm, ""director's commentary""."
45373,Lisa,uh... where are you?
45375,Lisa,oh! ... on the radio.
45377,Lisa,"thank you. mm. for low-fat, this pudding's pretty good."
45378,Lisa,unbelievable! we're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
45380,Lisa,"oh, this is so embarrassing."
45388,Lisa,"dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?"
45392,Lisa,"chief wiggum! oh, you sure got a lotta copies of the paper."
45399,Lisa,aren't those supposed to be confidential?
45402,Lisa,"but ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome."
45403,Lisa,wow. me... fit in.
45418,Lisa,excellent. now next week is our state of the city address. has everyone finalized their proposals?
45443,Lisa,who's up for some exploring?
45444,Lisa,what the--?
45447,Lisa,don't you serve anything that's even remotely japanese?
45452,Lisa,i think we all had that idea.
45460,Lisa,"stop doing that, mom."
45467,Lisa,are you standing up to get me to leave?
45470,Lisa,i'm so glad you're here. bart's really acting funny.
45482,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry the editor didn't like your review."
45496,Lisa,not anymore. i don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
45499,Lisa,"dad, no!"
45500,Lisa,it's gonna kill you!
45501,Lisa,don't! uh... um... it's low-fat!
45503,Lisa,"uh, dad?"
45521,Lisa,i think that was implied by what i said.
45529,Lisa,"the national weather service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling."
45532,Lisa,"could you build us a house, president carter? we can't go back to ours."
45536,Lisa,"oh, you poor little sheep! no one's sheared you for years!"
45543,Lisa,"""tomacco?"" that's pretty clever, dad. i mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
45551,Lisa,"hey, there was no accident at the plant. dad just wanted to go bowling!"
45557,Lisa,you already saw them.
45559,Lisa,are those real cobras?
45565,Lisa,you keep it.
45568,Lisa,"dad, there's a note on the back of your head."
45575,Lisa,bart broke all my books.
45588,Lisa,good. saddle up the bikes.
45600,Lisa,nobody! you're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy.
45613,Lisa,gary...
45616,Lisa,/ push! /
45621,Lisa,eep.
45629,Lisa,don't tell me mom dresses you.
45631,Lisa,"you know, the reason for the hat..."
45633,Lisa,oh! you're gonna be late.
45634,Lisa,here are your lunches. and no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
45635,Lisa,"you stay away from lenny. and where's your sweater, bart?"
45646,Lisa,good. maple soda?... a cell phone full of candy?... astronaut bread?
45649,Lisa,"oh, couldn't be better."
45651,Lisa,"i really thought i could handle this, but..."
45655,Lisa,what are you doing here?
45662,Lisa,any exposure to unsanitary conditions?
45663,Lisa,"okay, and... ""diagnose""."
45675,Lisa,you went to springfield u. you hate a & m.
45677,Lisa,"bart, i hope you don't believe your own hype."
45697,Lisa,"well, i thought maybe, for once, we could play a song that wasn't written by sousa."
45699,Lisa,take your arm off me.
45709,Lisa,"hello, i'd like to speak to president clinton, please. i wrote to him and he never wrote back... no, i don't want al gore!"
45710,Lisa,is that duncan?
45712,Lisa,"thank you, mr. president!"
45716,Lisa,use this plastic bag.
45724,Lisa,"dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes."
45727,Lisa,"mom, dad's on pbs!"
45735,Lisa,"oooh, there's ulysses s. grant, babe ruth ben franklin..."
45739,Lisa,"hey, gimme that! / that's mine!"
45743,Lisa,stop kicking me!
45750,Lisa,"excellent question. yes, i am proud to be america's first straight female president. helen?"
45753,Lisa,the country is broke? how can that be?
45755,Lisa,bart!
45759,Lisa,"sorry i'm late. i've been racking my brain, trying to think of something to cut from the budget."
45764,Lisa,"bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy."
45769,Lisa,yeah. did you even call about that messenger job?
45771,Lisa,"see, that has the same problem. we need to soften the blow."
45774,Lisa,"not now, bart. i'm about to speak to a hundred million people. this speech could make or break my presidency."
45780,Lisa,why you little...
45782,Lisa,"thanks a lot, bart. all right, how can we pay off our foreign debt?"
45785,Lisa,"ooh, but bart could screw everything up..."
45786,Lisa,"no, just keep him out of my hair."
45792,Lisa,absolutely. i want you and your pals to go away to camp david and write up a report on coolness.
45796,Lisa,"legalize what? oh, oh. consider it done."
45797,Lisa,"there you are. come on, we have to go. dad pushed a waitress. and mom lost twenty thousand dollars."
45799,Lisa,what about me?
45801,Lisa,"did gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
45810,Lisa,"okay, that's it... looks good... oh, bart, the bulldog didn't ante!"
45819,Lisa,all right! / cool! / lemme see!
45847,Lisa,"but i want to learn a dance i can use in real life, like the tango de la muerte."
45848,Lisa,nope.
45849,Lisa,sorry. the floor's kind of at an angle here. i'm gonna move over there.
45853,Lisa,"i'm just walking. listen, i know i said i wanted to be a dancer, but..."
45857,Lisa,why?
45863,Lisa,i get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
45866,Lisa,i've gotta go now.
45867,Lisa,"little vicki, i figured out how to dance. i can be in the show now!"
45891,Lisa,"awww. / oh, no."
45894,Lisa,"oh, i really miss mom."
45900,Lisa,"shut up all of you, or i'll sue."
45902,Lisa,none of us had ever sung before. but mr. geffen believed in us.
45904,Lisa,"it was such an honor to be on the walk of fame. i mean, there we were with hollywood royalty, like milton berle and nelson mandela."
45906,Lisa,"dad, i want to go to bed. aren't there child labor laws?"
45914,Lisa,"hey, what's goin' on?"
45921,Lisa,face it -- they're not great parents.
45927,Lisa,"wait, let me check the book."
45928,Lisa,you're probably right.
45933,Lisa,oh yeah? what's his name?
45936,Lisa,"oh, snorky..."
45938,Lisa,"hey, where are you going?"
45939,Lisa,"oh, you want to be with your friends."
45944,Lisa,"i kinda wish i hadn't freed their leader and, you know... doomed mankind."
45957,Lisa,"dad, the arena's in olde springfield."
45961,Lisa,it is my birthday.
45962,Lisa,"well, the book festival starts today..."
45965,Lisa,"catch, dad, catch!"
45977,Lisa,"oh, you're so heroic."
45983,Lisa,jesse?
45984,Lisa,you do yoga?
45988,Lisa,wow. um... i started an organic compost pile at home.
45990,Lisa,"oh, thank you, thank you!"
46002,Lisa,all right! a care bucket.
46017,Lisa,"oh mom, those loggers chopped down the tree! why did i have to leave my post?"
46020,Lisa,he cut off his favorite dread!
46028,Lisa,"well, i'll write you letters. on rice paper, with a soy pencil!"
46040,Lisa,not my dad.
46042,Lisa,da-ad!
46043,Lisa,"forget about him, dad. i'm proud of you."
46045,Lisa,"no, dad. you could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate."
46047,Lisa,something tells me he is.
46052,Lisa,"dad, i'll set up your computer. why don't you and bart go play in the back yard?"
46054,Lisa,well... a web page is supposed to be a personal thing. you've just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else. they could sue you for that.
46058,Lisa,"i'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. maybe you should quit while you're ahead."
46061,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
46062,Lisa,can i turn this off?
46068,Lisa,that's a party magic college.
46070,Lisa,ya-huh!
46080,Lisa,the cirque de purée. we've had tickets since septembre.
46082,Lisa,they made an elephant!
46096,Lisa,"dad, did you read all these books today?"
46099,Lisa,"dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. in fact, i made a graph."
46104,Lisa,"dad, how could you? we were connecting in such a meaningful way."
46111,Lisa,"how's your back, dad?"
46113,Lisa,that scary guy?
46115,Lisa,"you know what'd be good with these, is some ms. butterworth."
46116,Lisa,let's have a breakfast meeting.
46117,Lisa,"eww, how long has this baking soda been in here?"
46118,Lisa,"i'll call poison control. fran, it's me. just a heads-up."
46140,Lisa,me neither. i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
46149,Lisa,there's something weird about this video...
46156,Lisa,"l.t., thank god you're here! the government's putting subliminal messages in your videos!"
46158,Lisa,lieutenant smash...
46162,Lisa,super-liminal?
46166,Lisa,m-e-h. meh.
46168,Lisa,but you made it out of ham cubes.
46173,Lisa,great!
46175,Lisa,bart's got a girlfriend!
46176,Lisa,bart's got a problem!
46185,Lisa,hi there.
46187,Lisa,"well, lots of people like jazz fusion..."
46190,Lisa,"you like malibu stacey, too?"
46195,Lisa,would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard work?
46196,Lisa,well i'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. check out these indian burns.
46202,Lisa,someone will. i'm gonna crack the bully code.
46208,Lisa,"hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
46212,Lisa,"not talking, eh willie? just listen, then. i think i figured out what sets off that big ape francine... willie? willie?"
46214,Lisa,i believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
46235,Lisa,the repellent's all gone!
46239,Lisa,"""find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to africa."""
46240,Lisa,yayyy!
46251,Lisa,that's terrible!
46253,Lisa,"hey, mom."
46254,Lisa,look what mbali gave me.
46263,Lisa,oh no! it's the poachers!
46272,Lisa,"/ oh, he got overthrown!"
46273,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
46278,Lisa,"dad, no!"
46285,Lisa,"uh-oh, the bus!"
46289,Lisa,"thanks, mr. teeny!"
46300,Lisa,"we've been spinning for hours! i've got to get to my school and hand in linguo. oh, but i don't want to leave you."
46305,Lisa,that sounds like fat tony.
46308,Lisa,i've gotta get to school.
46314,Lisa,it's lucky for me that legs was an experienced mob doctor.
46317,Lisa,"are you blushing, mr. flanders?"
46321,Lisa,don't listen to him. you just have a good time at the eye doctor.
46323,Lisa,don't throw this away. it's rod's first tooth.
46325,Lisa,it looks like an amusement park.
46338,Lisa,night will come soon.
46347,Lisa,got any more tall tales?
46348,Lisa,"uhhh, could we hear another tall tale?"
46351,Lisa,we're gonna visit the place where j.c. penney sends their damaged merchandise.
46354,Lisa,"ohh, let's try matthew perry!"
46363,Lisa,abraca-dairy!
46365,Lisa,hocus-croakus!
46367,Lisa,release the dragon!
46370,Lisa,"the dark lord montymort, absorber of souls, sucker of essence!"
46373,Lisa,"bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry. even if you never become a great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother."
46376,Lisa,ack!
46381,Lisa,"well, why don't you do something about it?"
46382,Lisa,when are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
46383,Lisa,you're not even listening!
46384,Lisa,that's my brother.
46389,Lisa,it's not a school project. i'd've heard of it. i'd better go check it out.
46395,Lisa,this is pretty far to go just to spite moe.
46401,Lisa,moe?
46404,Lisa,"you did it, moe!"
46416,Lisa,that means dad's not a kidnapper. he's a hostage.
46417,Lisa,he did it! he saved her!
46423,Lisa,now you've done it. you really humiliated mom.
46424,Lisa,i suggest dinner and a show.
46426,Lisa,"well, the yaqui indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
46427,Lisa,"no dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
46435,Lisa,we'll never find the body under all this water.
46441,Lisa,you know it is.
46443,Lisa,what are they doing to the church?
46448,Lisa,that's it!
46453,Lisa,"those are all wonderful things. but they've cost the church its soul. and i, for one, will not be a part of it!"
46454,Lisa,no! i'm leaving this church forever!
46466,Lisa,richard gere?
46468,Lisa,that would be so great.
46474,Lisa,a buddhist wouldn't want any.
46477,Lisa,om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung. om mani padme hung.
46484,Lisa,"oh, sorry."
46500,Lisa,"oh sure, you take his side. just 'cause he bought you that house on st. james place."
46501,Lisa,"mom, that's not how you pry them apart."
46502,Lisa,and we carried it out as a family!
46503,Lisa,"thanks a lot, everybody. now i'll never get into an ivy league school."
46505,Lisa,"well, my room is my sanctuary. my family knows that and respects that."
46507,Lisa,thank you.
46509,Lisa,"look, we can't fall into old patterns. we've gotta think of a plan."
46510,Lisa,"fine, i'll talk like this."
46518,Lisa,but i have to save them! the books no one buys get chopped up and fed to pigs.
46521,Lisa,only on mars.
46529,Lisa,you do this every year. we are used to it.
46533,Lisa,who?
46537,Lisa,"we were playing four square, and i called no double taps, and ralph double taps. and i said ""you're out"". and he says ""i can do a sum-ber-salt"" which has nothing to do with anything."
46554,Lisa,their periodic table has two hundred and fifty elements!
46556,Lisa,"principal skinner, you're just stealing."
46566,Lisa,and where were you?
46570,Lisa,"maggie, what do you think?"
46584,Lisa,you know what? i bet he can't even fit into his old costume.
46585,Lisa,texas.
46586,Lisa,"dad, i'm on the line."
46589,Lisa,"look grampa, you're already getting a new neighbor."
46595,Lisa,but how? branson is a thousand miles away and we've got no car.
46606,Lisa,"no, mom. joan of arc."
46607,Lisa,...and please bless mama and papa and bartrand and coco chanel...
46615,Lisa,and now... attack!
46617,Lisa,"you are the true dauphin. you had this impostor try to fool me, to see if i was truly sent by god."
46622,Lisa,i would like to call my only witness: almighty god.
46635,Lisa,"ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. that's why i called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared."
46636,Lisa,"well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. and you can't hang up on a nun."
46640,Lisa,"not if we buy our tickets on the internet. it's really cheap if we change planes in phoenix, honolulu, sun city, and east st. louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
46644,Lisa,mm-hmm.
46650,Lisa,guys!
46658,Lisa,"okay, on this map i marked all the places that ronaldo liked to go. if we split up, we should be able to search them all."
46664,Lisa,"dad, it's one a.m. and i'm out of saliva."
46666,Lisa,"dad, you just said that three minutes ago."
46669,Lisa,who's mark spitz?
46678,Lisa,"well, i think we should try the springfield speaker's bureau."
46687,Lisa,two million.
46688,Lisa,"dad, i'm no fan of bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger."
46689,Lisa,"congratulations, dad. the first step is admitting it."
46694,Lisa,you're the jerk.
46703,Lisa,thanks. i'll see you in heaven.
46705,Lisa,ich bin ein... gymnast!
46712,Lisa,you guys are college students!
46716,Lisa,life sucks.
46718,Lisa,"well, bart's kinda-- no!"
46723,Lisa,i'll see you tomorrow!
46725,Lisa,in heaven!
46730,Lisa,i guess we won't be biking through italy.
46738,Lisa,i live in a house.
46740,Lisa,poor bart...
46741,Lisa,"i know just how you feel -- isolated, alone, cut off from everyone--"
46756,Lisa,"mom, dad, someone stole my malibu stacy collection!"
46765,Lisa,"well, duh."
46768,Lisa,"goldie, you were more than just a goldfish -- you were a member of the family."
46771,Lisa,"""william h. bonney."" ""gunned down july 14, 1881. aged twenty-one."" so young."
46772,Lisa,"""i dream of a world without guns."" don't we all, william."
46773,Lisa,"he's not my dead boyfriend, he is a dead boy who happens to be my friend. mr. bonney, i am going to make your dream come true!"
46774,Lisa,"if not for guns, poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
46777,Lisa,three cheers for a gun-free springfield. hip hip...
46785,Lisa,"dad, what are you doing?"
46792,Lisa,i had no idea disco stu was so complex.
46794,Lisa,that is so sweet.
46795,Lisa,"have you always resented us, dad?"
46796,Lisa,please don't say any more!
46803,Lisa,"are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, dad?"
46808,Lisa,"you should know, it's on the test!"
46809,Lisa,what? i've gotta be in the same class as him?
46810,Lisa,"okay, the sun rises in the east, so the rooster would probably want to lay it on the cool side..."
46812,Lisa,"stop, i want to learn on my own!"
46816,Lisa,you did better than me?!
46818,Lisa,i'll take ashley!
46827,Lisa,i spearheaded this one.
46829,Lisa,the bus!
46837,Lisa,what do you care?
46839,Lisa,oh.
46843,Lisa,i don't think i've done anything else.
46845,Lisa,bart!
46858,Lisa,"actually, i saw them earlier and i was working on it in the hall."
46859,Lisa,"mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?"
46860,Lisa,stop objectifying my mom!
46862,Lisa,be careful a-- uh-oh.
46863,Lisa,"mom, do something!"
46866,Lisa,"actually, it says here we're gonna see hockey."
46869,Lisa,hey kozlov! aim for the five hole! he's got an opening the size of red square.
46875,Lisa,"dad, we have to find a place soon. i really have to go to the bathroom and i'm out of tokens."
46878,Lisa,"with all this hard work, i'm too tired to worry about the world. and soon i will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!"
46881,Lisa,when you put your t-shirt on backwards?
46884,Lisa,it still beats disney's california adventure.
46892,Lisa,and you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
46896,Lisa,what happened to you two?
46897,Lisa,"mom, is that principal skinner sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?"
46898,Lisa,"so many categories... gym teacher of the year, substitute teacher of the year, most wheelchair-accessible school award?"
46899,Lisa,edna! edna! edna! edna!
46901,Lisa,"hey, i could really use one of those."
46909,Lisa,"i don't like mcnuggets, i'm a vegetarian!"
46928,Lisa,"aw... life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, dad. i feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been."
46957,Lisa,"there are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. the bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. and with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
46962,Lisa,"hmm, this is an interesting old book."
46964,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
46969,Lisa,"good point, dad. what would jesus do?"
46975,Lisa,"aw, that's so sweet."
46994,Lisa,well how often is that gonna come up?
46997,Lisa,ac/dc!
47004,Lisa,"dad, this is my moment in the sun. how can you miss it to be with a sandwich?"
47016,Lisa,"well, i suppose i could just skip college and marry milhouse..."
47025,Lisa,"you have made me feel so wonderful. thank you, springfield!"
47027,Lisa,"come on, come on, let's get to the beach!"
47030,Lisa,now she's dating mr. flanders. that's so romantic!
47051,Lisa,who's naïve?
47053,Lisa,hi.
47057,Lisa,"dad, this just isn't working."
47068,Lisa,"that's it! lisa simpson, astronomer!"
47073,Lisa,"thanks a lot, surviving beach boys."
47078,Lisa,does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
47087,Lisa,"forget it bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the fox satellite."
47092,Lisa,"it worked -- i got my sky back! dad, look!"
47093,Lisa,look!
47094,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
47096,Lisa,"oh, a jigsaw puzzle..."
47099,Lisa,does anyone have any swan heads? i've got nothing but necks.
47102,Lisa,this awful. it's like listening to schubert's unfinished symphony!
47111,Lisa,"silver bells, silver bells..."
47117,Lisa,"""on this battleground in 1881, fifty-six indians lost their lives and four brave americans lost their hats."""
47126,Lisa,"oh, it looks like a happy sheep."
47134,Lisa,...but a quicker way to the ranch is that shortcut.
47141,Lisa,run across!
47144,Lisa,"listen, luke. it's my fault clara got lost. i didn't know she was your sister, and i wanted you all to myself."
47148,Lisa,each year we lose seven species of gumdrops...
47149,Lisa,that's not mom!
47153,Lisa,you said his name two seconds ago.
47155,Lisa,"see, now that's the kind of dog you should be."
47157,Lisa,"it also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the duff corporate jet."
47169,Lisa,"uh-oh, dad. i think he peed on the rug."
47170,Lisa,"dad, you ate the last can of tuna."
47174,Lisa,yay! i wanna amble!
47199,Lisa,"""my dad's job."" my dad's job takes him to all parts of the community. he performs a valuable service, but is often misunderstood, like a vulture or the flesh-eating maggot."
47207,Lisa,there you are.
47208,Lisa,have you stopped to think about who you're hurting with this rampage?
47210,Lisa,but it's not too late. you can still fly to stockholm.
47214,Lisa,"oh come on, don't you get it? bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch."
47228,Lisa,"hey, as long as we're thinking about her, grandma's still alive."
47229,Lisa,"and the winner is, seventeen!"
47232,Lisa,i could join past presidents. like otto... or krusty!
47233,Lisa,"nelson, you're running for president?"
47243,Lisa,what would you change?
47253,Lisa,"or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- ­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."
47254,Lisa,"look, in the swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance--"
47255,Lisa,"""photo op helping kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""move the brushfire hazard needle..."" um, shouldn't i stay here and work on school policy?"
47262,Lisa,"and then, as school president, i don't have to take the hearing test."
47263,Lisa,"well, i think i can say with all humility, i am gonna be the best school president ever."
47264,Lisa,they've taken everything!
47266,Lisa,"well, i don't feel like it now."
47268,Lisa,skinner betrayed me!
47270,Lisa,you tricked me into betraying my fellow students!
47278,Lisa,"if we stand together, we are strong!"
47281,Lisa,"oh, this place is paradise."
47287,Lisa,"bart, why don't you spend the money on something for mom? she does so much for us."
47288,Lisa,"bart, that exhibit over there is biased, insensitive and anti-feminist."
47291,Lisa,how come?
47292,Lisa,"grampa, that's so romantic! we gotta go to england!"
47301,Lisa,"dad, you rear-ended the queen of england!"
47304,Lisa,push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
47321,Lisa,and bart's missing too!
47323,Lisa,it's gone!
47329,Lisa,aww.
47334,Lisa,"bart, the bar mitzvah is the most important event in a jewish boy's life. it's when he reads from the torah and becomes a man."
47344,Lisa,"i think that's ""drop."""
47345,Lisa,"cool, a toy store!"
47347,Lisa,"no, dad. this time you were just plain selfish."
47359,Lisa,her eyes aren't focused.
47360,Lisa,"ms. naegle, even though i disagree with your principles, i certainly admire your success."
47362,Lisa,"okay, but how?"
47372,Lisa,"too fluffy, too siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. me-ow!"
47379,Lisa,"dad, what are all those cuts?"
47380,Lisa,i guess i'm not meant to own a cat. i'm much happier petting this leaf.
47384,Lisa,"i'm keeping you! you're snowball five, but to save money on a new dish, we'll just call you snowball two and pretend this whole thing never happened."
47390,Lisa,why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
47394,Lisa,"""captain mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes. 'mmm, blowholes,' he drooled."" sounds like dad to me."
47402,Lisa,i have to research a paper. where did all the books go?
47403,Lisa,"""everybody poops, the video?"" ""yu-gi-oh price guides?"" there are hardly any books at all!"
47416,Lisa,"bart, you're in my family."
47433,Lisa,you told him our secret?!
47434,Lisa,oh. i see how it is.
47442,Lisa,bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd. no one calls me a nerd.
47447,Lisa,yay!
47451,Lisa,"okay, for malibu stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need?"
47457,Lisa,just because maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
47463,Lisa,i already have one of those.
47464,Lisa,"all right, if i'm second rate as the smart kid, i'll find a new raison d'être."
47467,Lisa,how 'bout these entrées? stuffed cabbage? can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse?
47468,Lisa,"all right, so what else is goin' on? let's see... hey! why do they call them field trips? we never go to a field!"
47471,Lisa,"it's called goth, eternally clueless one. my new name is ravencrow never-smiles."
47476,Lisa,you're making fun of him for something you made him do.
47479,Lisa,aren't you smart. let's try another one... a little harder this time.
47481,Lisa,"that's right! this spells ""dog."""
47483,Lisa,"maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly!"
47496,Lisa,i'm sorry i ran off. being second to maggie's not so bad. but why didn't maggie press the right button 'til i told her to?
47498,Lisa,i don't remember doing that. i would never cheat!
47510,Lisa,okay. i'll just stay calm and approach this scientifically.
47517,Lisa,"thanks for reading me ""the corrections."" it makes me feel better about my own family."
47518,Lisa,"he tried once, but he got confused and thought the book was real. he's still looking for that chocolate factory. it consumes him."
47528,Lisa,"dad, that's our address."
47542,Lisa,you're a great mom. you were always there for bart with love and support. his acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
47547,Lisa,i think skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
47561,Lisa,at the dayton arms hotel?
47567,Lisa,"no. we're gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they don't have one moment of fun."
47573,Lisa,i guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.
47577,Lisa,let me finish my sentence!
47583,Lisa,thank you mysterious stranger... where did he go?
47588,Lisa,"dad, please. it's obvious you're pie man. we've been getting his mail for weeks."
47590,Lisa,you're not mild-mannered. you're often liquored-up and rude.
47591,Lisa,"i want you to stop this, dad. before you get killed."
47592,Lisa,"well, i know one thing you could do..."
47593,Lisa,"as springfield's youngest buddhist, i am deeply honored to introduce the dalai lama."
47600,Lisa,"mom, why are you so mad?"
47601,Lisa,the perfect kiss!
47608,Lisa,this whole morning has been wonderful. too wonderful.
47614,Lisa,"we get it, mom."
47622,Lisa,o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain...
47623,Lisa,"my card here says ""aclu"" / now look what i'm going to do..."
47641,Lisa,"hmm, how about feature columnist?"
47643,Lisa,"nice work, bart! but give him a runny nose. i want the readers to gag on their morning cup of joe."
47646,Lisa,burns owns everything! i've gotta speak out before it's too late!
47651,Lisa,i can't. my mom's not picking me up for an hour.
47655,Lisa,i guess we're down to just me.
47657,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful."
47666,Lisa,the homer times?
47670,Lisa,you have a newspaper too?
47674,Lisa,hmmm.
47678,Lisa,"oh, my god! this is the worst halloween horror we've ever faced."
47680,Lisa,"what do you think, thomas pynchon?"
47685,Lisa,come on mom! you still have twenty minutes left -- you can fix it!
47694,Lisa,don't forget your secret ingredient...
47696,Lisa,"mom, if i don't have you to look up to, i don't have anyone."
47707,Lisa,this store makes me feel even worse about myself.
47708,Lisa,i know! it's such an unrealistic standard for young... huh?
47714,Lisa,i can't hear you.
47719,Lisa,that was too easy.
47723,Lisa,i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
47732,Lisa,the juice is still on the loose.
47736,Lisa,harper's magazine! i have a picture of lewis lapham on my binder.
47751,Lisa,"hello, u. n. women's conference!"
47759,Lisa,"mom, that was incredible!"
47761,Lisa,"praying to buddha, jesus, sponge bob. there's no time to be picky."
47775,Lisa,"bart, if you don't get up now, good luck getting a pancake. dad's pulled his chair right up to the stove."
47779,Lisa,great! will you play malibu stacy with me?
47783,Lisa,"it shows the history of nuclear physics, from marie curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor."
47788,Lisa,yes...
47790,Lisa,mom! dad built a device that would be deadly in the wrong hands! and he's holding it!
47796,Lisa,that show's gone off the air.
47798,Lisa,what countries are those?
47803,Lisa,you ate fruit! you ate fruit!
47811,Lisa,looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
47819,Lisa,"rappers stopped saying ""illin'"" twelve years ago."
47820,Lisa,"they stopped saying ""keepin' it real"" three years ago."
47824,Lisa,"so you see principal skinner, that's why i had to come to you."
47825,Lisa,"it doesn't matter. the point is, only with your help can i expose bart's lies."
47827,Lisa,this proves bart lied about being kidnapped!
47832,Lisa,i have a real suggestion.
47835,Lisa,i mean a man and a woman.
47842,Lisa,what happened to the glacier? it's nearly melted. this must be due to global warming!
47845,Lisa,"listen, people!"
47848,Lisa,glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
47849,Lisa,"people, please! i'm talking about toxic vapors."
47854,Lisa,you don't even care how upset i am! but this time you have gone too far.
47859,Lisa,"oops, need more soda."
47866,Lisa,"he's building a me! well, i mean, it's a little american-primitive... but who am i to dismiss outsider art? it shows he misses me... and this is the third thing!"
47873,Lisa,"aww, bart, i missed your lies... and i was kind of a pill. i guess."
47876,Lisa,"don't give up, aunt selma. china has thousands of baby girls who need adoption."
47877,Lisa,the great wall of china was begun nearly two thousand years ago in order to repel barbarian invaders.
47883,Lisa,"you look just like a buddha statue. now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity."
47896,Lisa,"hey, i know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. what if we..."
47897,Lisa,"wow, i was gonna say ""call reverend lovejoy,"" but i guess this could work."
47901,Lisa,"dad, snowball's not fat. she's just got winter fur."
47902,Lisa,"yeah, kiss and make up!"
47911,Lisa,can't breathe... someone dangle some string!
47917,Lisa,snowball does tricks?
47919,Lisa,you toyed with my heart like it was a toy heart.
47923,Lisa,"oh yeah? well, there's your girlfriend."
47926,Lisa,how did you know we were coming?
47933,Lisa,he was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week. that's not gonna happen!
47934,Lisa,"yay, mom!"
47954,Lisa,i brought you some weak tea and dry toast.
47958,Lisa,and if that diamond ring turns brass / mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
47959,Lisa,looks like you guys are on the mend.
47960,Lisa,"thanks, bart. that's really sweet."
47969,Lisa,i've been to paris / and london and tokyo town / but one crazy burg / has 'em all beat hands down...
47972,Lisa,and skinner / and grampa / and ol' disco stu...
47979,Lisa,really? what's wrong?
47980,Lisa,is it possible to get a green spotlight?
47982,Lisa,"that's cameron. girls go crazy over him. he's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
47987,Lisa,i don't like sausage.
47991,Lisa,you're working with cameron now?
47995,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
48002,Lisa,"dad, you sabotaged cameron for me!"
48004,Lisa,now you're getting creepy.
48008,Lisa,yay!
48011,Lisa,dad?!
48025,Lisa,i feel so much empathy for those villagers. they had to drink their own tears...
48033,Lisa,noble idiot! bring in the pie!
48034,Lisa,i dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system: the serfs.
48035,Lisa,"bart, a school-sponsored medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. you deserve to be expelled."
48036,Lisa,catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
48048,Lisa,those reindeer look really uncomfortable.
48052,Lisa,"dad, i don't think we're gonna find mom today. and i'm sick of eating at restaurant chains i've never even heard of, like skobo's and dim willie's."
48053,Lisa,ew.
48063,Lisa,can i sleep with you guys tonight?
48064,Lisa,"well, i heard they finished the stamp museum. that could be fun."
48066,Lisa,"wow, look at all these worthy americans..."
48070,Lisa,i didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
48073,Lisa,is it the chair?
48076,Lisa,yeah.
48081,Lisa,i've changed my mind! can you please open the gate?
48090,Lisa,"you know, you monsters seem scary, but when you get a little closer you're just funny."
48101,Lisa,"okay look, you and mom can fix this. what exactly happened between the two of you?"
48113,Lisa,dad! dad! wake up! you're not a robot!
48118,Lisa,"look! grampa's a gorilla, sideshow mel is spiderman, and nelson's a raccoon..."
48120,Lisa,bart?
48124,Lisa,"dad, there's no such thing as ""father's day eve."""
48136,Lisa,stupid dad. doesn't care about my feelings...
48141,Lisa,i guess.
48147,Lisa,"dad, we've got to do something."
48148,Lisa,lincoln was only one man.
48151,Lisa,"well, dad, you tried to make this town a better place. and no matter what, that makes you my hero."
48155,Lisa,summer opportunities.
48157,Lisa,uh... check.
48166,Lisa,"okay, if that means teacher."
48169,Lisa,my efforts!
48174,Lisa,milhouse is teaching me / to speak so prettily / i'll quip so wittily / when i'm in italy...
48176,Lisa,"sono cosí matto a lei! ho pensato abbiamo avuto qualcosa andando, e poi la prendo con questa sgualdrina! lei me fa malato!"
48177,Lisa,grazie. idioto!
48185,Lisa,"hey, she says the mayor speaks english."
48186,Lisa,sideshow bob!
48188,Lisa,"and literature is filled with tales of redemption, from jean valjean to the voice of buzz lightyear, tim allen."
48201,Lisa,"this is no act, they're actually trying to kill us!"
48202,Lisa,it's santa!
48211,Lisa,they must have just made this a toll road.
48213,Lisa,"boy, you sure showed them."
48217,Lisa,"no, but he told us to say hi. hi!"
48219,Lisa,i would have guessed low.
48220,Lisa,they had to feed you through a tube.
48225,Lisa,we've only brought in five dollars. and that came from mr. flanders buying back his own stuff.
48237,Lisa,okay. how do you address an archbishop?
48244,Lisa,"dad, get your own song."
48250,Lisa,now you have a friend.
48254,Lisa,with one little difference.
48256,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. i brought something that'll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!"
48257,Lisa,it's so impressive.
48262,Lisa,"oh. all right, um, i'll tell you something that happened to me last week. i was walking home from school..."
48264,Lisa,"hello, mr. bighorn sheep!"
48272,Lisa,"yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""hamlet."""
48281,Lisa,"aw dad, did my story make you cry?"
48290,Lisa,"dad, you can't keep this up for long."
48299,Lisa,i already saw that exact same show on another network.
48302,Lisa,but dad...
48308,Lisa,it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
48315,Lisa,"but you just got a new lease on life. why would you want to use it to hurt poor, helpless animals?"
48320,Lisa,hello?
48351,Lisa,a mental challenge.
48354,Lisa,"assistant groundskeeper skinner, don't you think it's wrong that i can't get the best math education because i'm a girl?"
48358,Lisa,"mom, i don't think this will fool anybody."
48366,Lisa,so... do you miss having the girls around?
48367,Lisa,did you know lisa simpson? i heard she was pretty cool.
48384,Lisa,peew! peew!
48389,Lisa,"and i did get better at math, but it was only by abandoning everything i believed in. i guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is..."
48397,Lisa,this is horrible.
48399,Lisa,"well, now it's time for my summer activity. you promised we could go to a museum."
48401,Lisa,"bart, it's still history."
48404,Lisa,this is slander! darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time!
48410,Lisa,"dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?"
48414,Lisa,"i'm so glad you could all come. i'll be reading to you from ""the origin of species"" by charles darwin."
48418,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
48426,Lisa,"isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? they're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now."
48429,Lisa,i understand. i'm not like my dad either.
48432,Lisa,"well, you're not gonna find any here."
48443,Lisa,you guys need a break. why don't i take bart with me to the children's be-bop brunch at jazzy goodtime's?
48445,Lisa,"not bad for a newbie, bart! you just may be the second-best player up here. in case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
48459,Lisa,here's the only thing i've been on the cover of.
48466,Lisa,i never wanted that to happen!
48467,Lisa,i won't get tired of him!
48469,Lisa,i'll take him too.
48474,Lisa,i feel so terrible. i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer... but i never thought the two stories would intersect.
48475,Lisa,sure.
48477,Lisa,do you have an idea?
48483,Lisa,this is a valuable skill. people might even pay you to build things for them.
48487,Lisa,i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world.
48493,Lisa,do you feel bad about what you did?
48499,Lisa,dad! a flying saucer blew up that statue!
48504,Lisa,"colonel, i hope you've learned that an occupying foreign force can never defeat a determined local populace. among the many things we learned in vietnam is that a well-motivated..."
48506,Lisa,how many others do you have?
48508,Lisa,moe!
48510,Lisa,because i suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.
48513,Lisa,"you know, artfully arranged, these fragments could be an epic poem -- like t.s. eliot's ""the wasteland."""
48516,Lisa,"i don't care about my grade. i'm gonna send moe's poem to ""american poetry perspectives."""
48523,Lisa,"mr. szyslak -- there must be some person, possibly in this very room, who believed in you when no one else did."
48529,Lisa,"oh, moe."
48538,Lisa,mom! bart's drinking coffee!
48541,Lisa,you actually convinced people not to go to nelson's party?
48543,Lisa,"all right, no husband."
48558,Lisa,"dad, you can read to me anytime."
48566,Lisa,kinda.
48570,Lisa,end of story.
48578,Lisa,yum-yum fish?
48579,Lisa,maybe you just overfished them.
48585,Lisa,wait! haven't you learned a lesson here? over-fishing and greed have brought this town nothing but rack and ruin.
48602,Lisa,i feel it would be best if we just stayed friends.
48609,Lisa,"...hitachee tribe.,hitachee tribe,2
111238,390,17,lisa simpson: wait"
48619,Lisa,"yes, we're among the lostest."
48620,Lisa,centered. centered. you know where the four states come together?
48623,Lisa,"slow down! you're too close to that car! your hands should be at ten and two, not three and nothing!"
48628,Lisa,"yes, you should've!"
48638,Lisa,you asked to see me?
48646,Lisa,pre-tentious laughs at bunuel retrospectives...outsider art made by mental defectives!
48648,Lisa,"mrs. skin-ner is ""mame""!"
48654,Lisa,stop the tour!
48658,Lisa,pong!
48659,Lisa,pong!
48660,Lisa,pong!
48666,Lisa,"dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!"
48669,Lisa,we did it! now we can enjoy boxingham palace in peace!
48670,Lisa,"sure, i guess. a couple of birds pooped on it over here."
48674,Lisa,i picked my malibu stacy hybrid convertible. it runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
48676,Lisa,"i agree, mom, it's very sad. but we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos."
48677,Lisa,"ooo, there's my first saxophone recital!"
48693,Lisa,"dad, where'd you get that outfit?"
48695,Lisa,"sadly, no. i'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but i'm not surprised."
48697,Lisa,"um, uh..."
48703,Lisa,not interested.
48704,Lisa,"gimme, gimme, gimme!"
48708,Lisa,so from now on i'll play soccer for the same reason i study chemistry -- for fun!
48716,Lisa,"feel better now, bart?"
48719,Lisa,"bart, stop! no one's mad at you anymore! right?"
48722,Lisa,i think maybe we cou-ould.
48728,Lisa,larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt?
48735,Lisa,springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!
48738,Lisa,"corn... more corn... another kid getting' thrown in the air... witch's coven... seattle space needle... amateur production of ""you can't take it with you""... i'm getting dizzy... and corn again."
48743,Lisa,dad!
48745,Lisa,"what's the matter, bart?"
48747,Lisa,"no, boy, that's hanukah."
48757,Lisa,so why steal the yogurt? we have to find out what they're up to.
48760,Lisa,"principal skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."
48768,Lisa,a mole?!
48770,Lisa,"my god, that's a class-five stench-dispersal unit! we have to short out that fan."
48783,Lisa,"dad, that's ludicrous!"
48784,Lisa,"no! i mean chris ""ludacris"" bridges, right here in the dental plaza!"
48788,Lisa,"one thing i've always wondered: how can fox news be so conservative, when the fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? they don't fit together."
48791,Lisa,"mr. brockman, you're a huge hit!"
48792,Lisa,world.
48793,Lisa,one... two...
48796,Lisa,oh my god! you don't suppose they're gonna start--
48799,Lisa,"good luck on your first day, dad."
48807,Lisa,we crashed a funeral!
48823,Lisa,you clicked the cart!
48824,Lisa,creative responses for infant edu-loving!
48833,Lisa,"whatever we did, we're sorry."
48836,Lisa,"oh my god, an alien! i'm gonna blow rachel goodman away at show-and-tell!"
48837,Lisa,"as this month's rotating president of the springfield future scientists club, may i say: i'm sorry. and is there anything we can do to help?"
48838,Lisa,"fiber-optic cable, uranium two thirty-five, two tickets to ""avenue q"", seven billion body bags..."
48840,Lisa,way to get rid of bart. he can be such a pest.
48841,Lisa,they were in yesterday's new york times!
48843,Lisa,i can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad.
48844,Lisa,what do we do now?
48847,Lisa,i warned ya. and yet my punishment is no less severe. that's odd.
48848,Lisa,"oh, that's great."
48849,Lisa,"tarantulas! i'll save you, baby burps-a-lot!"
48850,Lisa,spider burps!
48851,Lisa,who is it?
48855,Lisa,that's so poetic.
48862,Lisa,"oh no, i ripped it."
48866,Lisa,mm-hm.
48870,Lisa,"and dad, i hope you learned something from this."
48874,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
48876,Lisa,"yummy, yumma!"
48885,Lisa,which one?
48887,Lisa,"macbeth, act one, scene seven. look it up!"
48894,Lisa,his mother was a shakespearean actress!
48895,Lisa,his father is a doctor...
48899,Lisa,stop that cremation!
48906,Lisa,"mom, they're taking ralph's candidacy seriously! this is a disaster."
48912,Lisa,ralph and i used to date.
48916,Lisa,i like the sound of that.
48919,Lisa,"you know, mom and dad are almost forty, and bart is ten. that means you didn't have him until way after high school."
48926,Lisa,in the first place... do whatever you want. i'm getting' a candy apple.
48931,Lisa,how is that fun? fun is only fun if everyone's having fun.
48932,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
48935,Lisa,"i never dreamed an american car designed in germany, assembled in mexico from parts made in canada, could be so amazing."
48943,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna get it!"
48945,Lisa,oh my god!
48948,Lisa,but bart...
48951,Lisa,"hey, i was trying to help him. at worst, i'm an accomplice. i'm an accomplice!"
48960,Lisa,nothing!
48967,Lisa,"why are you being so quiet, bart? are you judging me? please don't judge me."
48973,Lisa,what was that?
48979,Lisa,get off me!
48985,Lisa,"the last book in the series goes on sale at midnight, and we're gonna go stand in line."
48990,Lisa,i didn't know you cared about ballet.
48993,Lisa,so what happened?
48996,Lisa,oh.
49000,Lisa,"uh, i don't know i--"
49003,Lisa,how do you cope with it?
49005,Lisa,wowww... no! all i need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
49006,Lisa,nothing like fresh air.
49011,Lisa,my feminist heroes!
49014,Lisa,when's our next break?
49017,Lisa,a sturgeon is a fish.
49039,Lisa,ew!
49042,Lisa,"keep it down, i'm reading ""harry potter!"""
49043,Lisa,"aw, cheer up, you've still got your talent, and that new song you wrote is gonna be a really big hit."
49051,Lisa,okay. meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
49053,Lisa,it's a no-brainer.
49054,Lisa,don't worry. i called some animal activists who can help us get in. i'll just give the signal. milk is murder!
49066,Lisa,i'll get your fabrics!
49067,Lisa,"for you, dad -- i consider that a victory."
49068,Lisa,anything?
49074,Lisa,"oh, that's a funny joke, mr. kinkaid. is this an art class or a comedy class? seriously, why is it three?"
49080,Lisa,yeah. getting back to my grade...
49081,Lisa,"well, according to aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"
49083,Lisa,"my family. ...language, rhythm and spectacle."
49085,Lisa,"um, okay."
49086,Lisa,i'm making a documentary about a very special family.
49089,Lisa,"okay everyone -- just be yourself. don't look in the camera, pretend i'm not here, and... no toupees..."
49091,Lisa,what are you boys doing on the foley stage?
49093,Lisa,"dad, no!"
49107,Lisa,"ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
49114,Lisa,"mom, you tricked us!"
49115,Lisa,i wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using styrofoam!
49116,Lisa,i want a poodle!
49121,Lisa,"you know, it's a boy dolphin."
49133,Lisa,"yay, bart!"
49134,Lisa,that's not fair -- bart was great.
49136,Lisa,"in fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you! did you know the discovery channel doesn't have a single paid employee?"
49138,Lisa,wha... but...
49141,Lisa,"here you go, krusty."
49144,Lisa,yo ho ho and a bottle of fun!
